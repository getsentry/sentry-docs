  Vercel released support for [Cron Jobs](https://vercel.com/blog/cron-jobs), and since we also have support for [Cron Job Monitoring](https://blog.sentry.io/cron-job-monitoring-beta-because-scheduled-jobs-fail-too/#step-1-go-to-the-new-crons-beta-tab) (Beta) for Node.js, we wanted to make the set up process even easier.\
\
The Sentry Next.js SDK 7.52.0 now automatically creates [Sentry Cron Monitors](https://docs.sentry.io/product/crons/) for your [Vercel Cron Jobs](https://vercel.com/docs/cron-jobs) configured via `vercel.json` when deployed on Vercel. Once you set up your Vercel Cron Jobs, make sure you are on the latest version of the [Sentry Next.js SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/nextjs) and Sentry will automatically create monitors for your recurring jobs.
