  Understand the *user impact* of your backend errors by viewing the associated replay video of the user session. Here's how:\
\
1\. On Issue Details for backend web projects (e.g., Python), you'll now see a ["Replays" tab](< https://docs.sentry.io/product/issues/issue-details/#tabs:~:text=can%20merge.-,Replays,-%E2%80%93%20A%20list%20of>) where you can find replays associated with the issue. A replay preview will also be displayed on the Issue Details of the latest event, if applicable.

2\. The [Replay Details](https://docs.sentry.io/product/session-replay/replay-details/?original_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.sentry.io%2F) view will now *also* cover backend errors in the Timeline, Breadcrumbs, Issues tab and more.

Now you can answer questions such as: Does this slow query affect the user experience, or does this backend error break any important pages?\
