  We have released a new major version of our [Android/Java SDK 7.0.0](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/releases/tag/7.0.0).

Notable changes include:

* Connectivity changes are detected and cached events are re-uploaded when internet connection is re-established, so you don’t have to wait until the next app restart to get crashes in Sentry

* A new `sentry-okhttp` artifact is available, which is a pure Java module and can be used in non-Android projects

* `Sentry.getSpan()` now returns the root span/transaction instead of the latest span, which will make the span hierarchy leaner and more readable

* Improvements to reduce probability of the SDK causing ANRs

* The `minSdk` level was updated to 19

Plus, a [new supporting version 4.0.0 of the Sentry Android Gradle plugin](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-android-gradle-plugin/releases/tag/4.0.0) ensures a smooth update to the new SDK version.

**PLEASE NOTE**: For self-hosted users, there are breaking changes introduced in this update. Refer to the [upgrade guide](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/android/migration/#migrating-from-iosentrysentry-android-6x-to-iosentrysentry-android-700) for a complete list of breaking changes.
