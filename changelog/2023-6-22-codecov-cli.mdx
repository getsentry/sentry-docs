  The new Codecov CLI lets you can configure code coverage and more, right in the command line. With the CLI you’ll be able to check coverage insights locally, apply a single token to all your repos, and improve code reviews with accurate coverage comparisons.

* Local Upload: Check code changes instantly in your terminal, no more waiting on your CI pipeline or browser refreshing.

* Global Upload Token:** **Simplify configuration for multiple repositories. Streamline uploads without individual repository tokens.

* PR Base Picking:** **Optimize code reviews with accurate coverage comparisons by selecting the base commit when merging to the main/master branch.
