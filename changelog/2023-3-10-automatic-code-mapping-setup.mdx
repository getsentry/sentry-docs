  Sentry will automatically set up code mappings for your Python, Javascript, Ruby and Node projects. Once you have set up a GitHub integration, automatic code mappings is enabled by default. After Sentry sets up your code mappings, you should notice that more issues have [Suspect Commits](https://docs.sentry.io/product/issues/suspect-commits/) and [Codeowners](https://docs.sentry.io/product/issues/issue-owners/#code-owners)-based assignments. Note that Codeowners is only available on the Business Plan.
