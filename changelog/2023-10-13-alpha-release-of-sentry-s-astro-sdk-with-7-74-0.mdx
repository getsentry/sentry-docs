  Here's [version 7.74.0](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/releases/tag/7.74.0) of the JavaScript SDKs. This is a pretty significant update with 25+ changes, including:

* The first alpha version of our new [SDK for Astro](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/develop/packages/astro/README.md). Feel free to leave feedback [on GH](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/9182)!

* A new top-level `addIntegration`[ function](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/9186) to add integrations after the SDK was initialized

* A generalized `continueTrace`[ function](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/9164) to improve distributed tracing
