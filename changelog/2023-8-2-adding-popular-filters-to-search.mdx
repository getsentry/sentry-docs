  We’ve launched **Popular Filters** in Issues Search ![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/emoji-datasource-apple/img/apple/64/1f50e.png)

* We now surface your favorite filters at the top of the Search dropdown, enabling you to quickly find the issues that matter to you

* When autocompleting Assignees, we've added your teams as suggested values so you save time searching

* The Issue Category dropdown (errors, performance, crons) is now the first filter
