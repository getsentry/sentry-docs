  Uncover [accessibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/What_is_accessibility) issues in your application with [**Session Replay**](https://docs.sentry.io/product/session-replay/)**.** Accessibility is the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible—tremendously improving the user experience for individuals with disabilities, on mobile devices, or even on slow network connections.\
\
You can run accessibility checks (powered by [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core)) for pages or page states you're interested in to ensure that your pages follow common accessibility standards and are [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) (WCAG) compliant.

Here’s how it works:

1. Open the "Accessibility" tab on [any recorded replay](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/replays/)

2. Pause the replay at any timestamp (when a specific page is in view, or after an interesting interaction)

3. Click the button "Run validation for `<timestamp>`"
