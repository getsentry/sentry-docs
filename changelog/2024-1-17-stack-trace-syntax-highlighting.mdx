  Your code just got a makeover! Stack traces now incorporate syntax highlighting for code snippets.

Syntaxes are determined based on the frame's file extension. Enjoy support for all mainstream (and some niche) languages, enhancing your debugging experience across all your services.

This change also features a refreshed palette for improved readability. Try it out in both light and dark mode!
