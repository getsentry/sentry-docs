  We’ve introduced 4 new tags to our out-of-the-box performance metrics and namely OS name, http status code, browser name and country code. You can now additionally filter your transaction data based on these new tags for more granular analysis in [Performance](https://docs.sentry.io/product/performance/) and [Dashboards](https://docs.sentry.io/product/dashboards/), or to create more specific [Performance Alerts](https://docs.sentry.io/product/alerts/create-alerts/metric-alert-config/).
