  We've shipped a few quality of life updates to resolving issues in a release:

1. Clarified if the release used to resolve an issue is using semantic versioning. Customers may use formatting like v1.0.0, which Sentry does not consider as semver. Rather, Sentry is looking for a format like package@1.0.0. [Learn more here](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/rust/guides/actix-web/configuration/releases/#bind-the-version)

2. When an issue becomes a regression, the issue activity now describes how the two release versions were compared. If the project is using semver, Sentry compares the versions. Everything else is compared using date released.

3. Improved the user experience when releases need to be set up.
