  You can enable the following features for Sentry's GitHub Enterprise integration:

* Stack trace links: Stack trace linking takes you from a file in your Sentry stack trace to that same file in your source code.

* Code Owners-based issue assignment: Import your existing GitHub CODEOWNERS files to automatically assign Sentry issues and route alerts to the responsible individuals and teams.

* Suspect Commits: Identify the developer who most recently changed the code causing the error

You must ensure that you have code mappings set up for your projects in Sentry to use these features

Please see the docs for our [GitHub integration](https://docs.sentry.io/product/integrations/source-code-mgmt/github/#stack-trace-linking) to get started.
