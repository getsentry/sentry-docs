  As your team grows, new developers will write code that can cause issues. You can now easily identify these team members and invite them to your Sentry organization if you use our GitHub integration.

Go to your Org's **Settings->Members** to see a quick view of your missing teammates for you to invite to your organization

By default, this feature is automatically enabled once your GitHub integration has been set up. To disable it, go to **Settings > Integrations > GitHub->Features** and toggle it off. You can see our [docs](https://docs.sentry.io/product/integrations/source-code-mgmt/github/#missing-member-detection) for more details
