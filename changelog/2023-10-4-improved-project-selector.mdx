  If you use Sentry with multiple projects, you've likely encountered the "Lock" button. This button was designed to keep your current project selection consistent as you navigated between different pages.

We received feedback that the "Lock" feature was unintuitive and cumbersome. Users also found it easy to forget to click "Apply" to save their changes.

Today, we're announcing our brand new, lock-free project selector for Early Access organizations. We've been testing this internally for a while and are excited for everyone to finally get their hands on it.
