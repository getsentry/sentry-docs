  At Sentry, we employ several measures to avoid Session Replay negatively impacting the end-user performance of your web application. A new measure we introduced is if the Session Replay SDK detects that performance will potentially be degraded with Session Replay, it will proactively stop recording that user session. When this happens, there will be a breadcrumb in the [Replay Details](https://docs.sentry.io/product/session-replay/replay-details/).\
\
Read more in our [documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/session-replay/configuration/#mutation-limits).\
\
These are the prerequisites to use this optimization:\
1\. Your org needs to have[ sent replay events](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/session-replay/)\
2\. JavaScript SDK (or related framework) version of [7.54.0](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/releases/tag/7.54.0) or higher
