  Today we are excited to launch an update to the [Queries](https://docs.sentry.io/product/performance/queries/) tool that will lead developers from the SQL query directly to the source code. Many modern applications rely on ORMs (e.g., SQLAlchemy) to interact with the DB, so identifying the code context is essential to resolving performance problems.

The precise line of application code triggering the query will be surfaced to the user on the Query Summary page:

**For the initial feature release, we will be supporting Laravel and Django. Additional platforms will be supported in the future.**

Please Note: To use the Queries tool, you will need to set up our Performance product. Please take a look at our [setup guide](https://docs.sentry.io/product/performance/getting-started/) to get started.
