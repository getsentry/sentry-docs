  If you want to use [Sentry Crons](https://blog.sentry.io/cron-job-monitoring-beta-because-scheduled-jobs-fail-too/) to monitor all your Celery Beat scheduled tasks, you can do so now by the flip of a switch:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.celery import CeleryIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="...",
    integrations=[
        CeleryIntegration(monitor_beat_tasks=True) # ðŸ‘ˆ set this switch to True!
    ]
)
```

Now the Sentry Python SDK will discover and monitor all your Celery Beat scheduled tasks. You know now when your scheduled tasks are failing, taking too long or are not running at the expected time. See the [documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/guides/celery/crons/#celery-beat-auto-discovery) to learn more.
