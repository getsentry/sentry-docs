  As always we are very sensitive to bundle size conerns of our users. The latest SDK version 7.78.0 caps off a series of bundle size improvements we made to [Session Replay](https://sentry.io/for/session-replay/), leading to a 20 KB (~40% of Replay, ~25% of the full SDK) reduction.\
\
Still while decreasing bundle we have shipped some new features:

* Adds a new `beforeErrorSampling()` config callback to Replay

* Adds improvements to our [Astro SDK](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/astro/)

* Improves Replay performance by moving expensive truncation tasks out of the SDK

* Improves our support for [Next.js](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/) App Router

Check our [changelog](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/releases/tag/7.78.0) to see the full details of this release.
