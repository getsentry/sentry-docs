  You can enable stack trace linking for Bitbucket and Azure DevOps integrations. This allows you to jump from your error in Sentry to your source code directly by clicking the "Open this line in Bitbucket/Azure DevOps" links.

You must add code mappings between your Sentry project and your Repository to enable this. Please read our docs for [Bitbucket](https://docs.sentry.io/product/integrations/source-code-mgmt/bitbucket/#stack-trace-linking) and [Azure DevOps](https://docs.sentry.io/product/integrations/source-code-mgmt/azure-devops/#stack-trace-linking) to set this up.
