  Automated Test Selection intelligently chooses which tests to run based on code changes in a given commit. Instead of running through your entire test suite on every commit, which could take +45 minutes for a decent code base, Codecov will focus only on critical tests saving teams hours and reducing CI costs.

Automated Test Selection is available in beta and currently supports Python projects. Check out our [docs](https://docs.codecov.com/docs/getting-started-with-ats) to get started.
