  The new `ContextLines` integration is now available as an optional integration in `@sentry/integrations` for browser based SDKs. It adds source code from inline JavaScript of the current page’s HTML (e.g. JS in `<script>` tags) to stack traces of captured errors. The `ContextLines` integration is useful when you have inline JS code in HTML pages that can’t be accessed by Sentry’s backend, for example, due to a login-protected page.\
