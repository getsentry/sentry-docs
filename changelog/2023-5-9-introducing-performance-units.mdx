  With the launch of Profiling, Sentry has moved to unit-based pricing for Performance Monitoring. Customers will be charged based on a volume of total Performance units for different Performance event types:Â 

* **Transactions** - use 1 Performance Unit and sent from projects with only [Tracing configured.](https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-basics/tracing/)

* **Transactions with Profiling** - use 1.3 Performance Units and sent from projects that have [Profiling](https://docs.sentry.io/product/profiling/) configured.

Performance units replaced what is previously known as a 'reserved transactions quota'.
