  Spend Allocation allows you to better allocate reserved events based on your needs by allocating volumes of their [reserved errors](https://docs.sentry.io/product/accounts/pricing/#prepaid-reserved-capacity), transactions, and attachments to specific projects. This ensures that your projects will get at least the allocated volume, and any additional consumption will count against the unallocated pool and *on-demand* events.

Please read this [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/discussions/44562) for more details

Note: This feature is only available for Business and Enterprise plans
