  Our new and improved [User Feedback](https://docs.sentry.io/product/user-feedback/) product is now available to all organizations in open beta. The latest addition to User Feedback allows you to install a web widget on your application so you can collect feedback from your end-users *at any time. *For example, when they run into a bug or are simply confused by what they are seeing (e.g., broken links, misleading UX, typos, etc.).

Sentry then links that feedback to available rich debugging context, including replays and any errors seen within them, as well as tags such as URL, allowing you to get to the root of the problem faster. See your feedback submissions in the "User Feedback" left-nav menu item.

To [set up](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/user-feedback/#user-feedback-widget) the new User Feedback widget, add the Feedback integration to your `Sentry.init` call:

```
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "__DSN__",
  integrations: [
    new Sentry.Feedback({
      // Additional SDK configuration goes in here
      colorScheme: "light",
     }),
  ],
});
```

For further customization of the widget, please see [our documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/user-feedback/configuration/). A prerequisite to installing the widget is a browser JavaScript SDK (or related framework) version of `7.85.0` or higher.\
