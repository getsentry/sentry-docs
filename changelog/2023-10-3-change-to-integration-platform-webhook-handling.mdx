  If you are subscribing to Sentry's Webhooks then your server should respond within 1 second. Otherwise, the response is considered a timeout. If a webhook has 1000 timeouts within 24 hours, the webhook will be unsubscribed from receiving events. This limitation does not apply for published integrations built by partners

Please find more details in our [docs](https://docs.sentry.io/product/integrations/integration-platform/webhooks/)
