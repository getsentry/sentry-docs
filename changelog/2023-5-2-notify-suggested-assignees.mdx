  You can increase the signal value of your alerts by notifying Suggested Assignees directly via your Issue Alert rules by adding the notification action *Send to Suggested Assignees.*

*Send to Suggested Assignees* action will notify Suspect Commits as well. This new action replaces the *Send to Issue Owners* alert action. Read our [discussion](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/discussions/46696) to learn more
