  Sentry monitors the p95 of your top **endpoints** in your backend projects and creates issues for sustained regressions. This is limited to specific transaction ops. See [docs](https://docs.sentry.io/product/issues/issue-details/performance-issues/endpoint-regressions/) for more info.

This is a whole new type of performance issue that automatically highlights metrics that get worse over time.
