  SQL is shown throughout Sentry.io in issue breadcrumbs, performance issues, and transaction spans. Previously this SQL was not formatted, making it difficult to review queries for the information you need. With this quality of life update, we automatically format the SQL displayed within Sentry so that you find the right information to fix issues, faster.
