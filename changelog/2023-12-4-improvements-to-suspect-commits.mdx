  The logic powering suspect commits has been updated to more accurately identify the cause of your issues.

Instead of only looking at the top frame of an issue, Sentry now checks the entirety of your stack trace to identify suspect commits. Because upstream code changes often cause downstream errors, you should encounter more accurate suspect commits.

Another way that we've increased the accuracy is by ignoring old commits. Only commits less than a year old will be eligible to be the suspect commit.

To learn more about this feature or learn how to set up suspect commits for your organization,[ read our docs](https://docs.sentry.io/product/issues/suspect-commits/). If you have feedback, we'd love to hear it in this [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/discussions/47522)!
