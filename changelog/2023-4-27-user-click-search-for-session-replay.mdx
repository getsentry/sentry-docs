  [User click search](https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-basics/search/searchable-properties/#replay-properties) allows you to search for replays by DOM element, or in other words, where users have clicked to interact with specific parts of your web app. With Session Replay, you can already search and narrow your replay results down by user email, browser, or numbers of errors in a replay. With this feature, you can now find replays where users *clicked *on a button they are reporting is buggy, and watch their sessions to see exactly what happened.
