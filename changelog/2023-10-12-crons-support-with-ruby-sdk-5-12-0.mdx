  We are excited to announce Sentry has extended support for Crons for Ruby devs!

Standard job frameworks such as `ActiveJob` and `Sidekiq` with a `perform` method can use the `Sentry::Cron::MonitorCheckIns` mixin module to automatically capture check-ins.\
\
Check out [our docs](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/ruby/crons/) to learn more, and refer to our release notes to see more features and fixes in the [5.12.0 release](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/releases/tag/5.12.0) of our Ruby SDK.
