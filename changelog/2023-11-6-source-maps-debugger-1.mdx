  Uploading source maps gives you the full Sentry Errors experience.

* readable stack traces

* source code linking

* improved issue grouping to reduce noise

To help ensure we guide you on the right path to uploading source maps to Sentry we've shipped a new debugger window on the issue details page. Check for the "Unminify Code" button in your stack trace now, and see our [docs](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/sourcemaps/) to learn more!
