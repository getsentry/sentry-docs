  We are thrilled to announce the [release](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-php/releases/tag/4.0.0) of a new major version of our PHP SDK 4.0.0!

Some new features available with this ship:

* Added new fluent APIs

* Simplified the breadcrumb API

* New `logger` option

* New default cURL HTTP client (no more 3rd party dependencies)

For self-hosted users pay attention to the new requirements associated with the new release, if you're using Sentry SaaS and SDK out of the box, no concern from this change. Please refer to the [upgrade guide](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-php/blob/4.0.0/UPGRADE-4.0.md) for a complete list of breaking changes.
