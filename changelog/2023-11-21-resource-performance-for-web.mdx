  We are launching a new workflow centred on providing better visibility into resource performance - specifically JavaScript, CSS, and Fonts - across your web application in production. 

**What’s New**

* **Render-blocking Resources** Set *Blocking* filter to ‘Yes’ to quickly identify which scripts, stylesheets, and fonts are blocking core functionality on your page

* **Resource Summary** Pinpoint which pages are blocked or impacted by a given asset with stats like average transfer / encode / decode size, average duration, and requests per minute

To use Resources, you will need to set up our Performance product. Please take a look at our [setup guide](https://docs.sentry.io/product/performance/getting-started/) for instructions. You can also learn more about this update in our [docs](https://docs.sentry.io/product/performance/resources/)!
