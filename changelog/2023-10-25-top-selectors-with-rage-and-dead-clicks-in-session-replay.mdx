  Now you can easily find actionable replays at the top of the Session Replay page. At first glance, you can see which selectors are most problematic and easily click into replays to help you debug the problem.

The widgets show the top selectors that have been rage or dead clicked on. Expanding the selector (and clicking the blue selector link) will show example replays that contain clicks on that selector.

Top 3 selectors not enough? Click the "See all selectors" button to see *all *selectors that have been rage or dead clicked on.

These are the prerequisites to use the feature:\
1\. Your org needs to have[ sent replay events](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/session-replay/)\
2\. JavaScript SDK (or related framework) version of [7.60.1](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/releases/tag/7.60.1) or higher
