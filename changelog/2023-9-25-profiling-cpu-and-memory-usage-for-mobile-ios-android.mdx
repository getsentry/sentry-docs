  For mobile developers, the Sentry Profiling tool now captures and displays CPU and Memory usage for your iOS or Android applications.

* On the flame graph page for a mobile transaction, CPU and Memory usage over time are displayed just above the flame graph itself, such that you can quickly understand the overall resource requirements for your code

Tracking CPU and Memory usage requires that you have the Performance and Profiling features enabled. You can deploy both with only a few lines of code. Please see our [setup guide](https://docs.sentry.io/product/profiling/getting-started/) for details.
