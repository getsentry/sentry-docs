  You can now create more granular conditions in metric alerts to match your specific needs.

Previously only a few basic properties were available for filtering: `release`, `transaction`, `transaction.status`, `transaction.op`, `http.method`, `http.status_code`, `os.name`, `browser.name`, and [`geo.country`](http://geo.country)`_code`.

Customers on Business and Enterprise plans, can now access a wider variety of fields or tags in addition to the basic properties, in order to create more advanced filtering conditions.

Sentry can only start collecting these metrics after the alert is saved. If such a filter is used, during the alert creation, Sentry provides an estimate of the metric for the previous period.
