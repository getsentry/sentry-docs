  You can define ownership rules from an issue itself. This helps you ensure that similar issues in the future will have the right Suggested Assignee for auto-assignment and targeted notifications.

You can also view all the applicable ownership rules for your project by going to your Project Settings->Ownership rules. This allows you to search for code paths that are not owned by any team in Sentry.
