  In Sentry Python SDK version 1.23.0 we introduced support for [Loguru](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru).

Example usage (see the [documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/configuration/integrations/loguru/) to learn more):

```

import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.loguru import LoguruIntegration

# Add the Loguru integration
sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    integrations=[
        LoguruIntegration(),
    ],
)

# Capture errors and exceptions:
from loguru import logger
logger.debug("I am ignored")
logger.info("I am a breadcrumb")
logger.error("I am an event", extra=dict(bar=43))
logger.exception("An exception happened")
```

What will happen:

* An error event with the message `"I am an event"` will be created.

* `"I am a breadcrumb"` will be attached as a breadcrumb to that event.

* `bar` will end up in the `extra` attributes of that event.

* `"An exception happened"` will send the current exception from `sys.exc_info()` with the stack trace to Sentry. If there's no exception, the current stack will be attached.

* The debug message `"I am ignored"` will not be captured by Sentry. To capture it, set `level` to `DEBUG` or lower in `LoguruIntegration`.
