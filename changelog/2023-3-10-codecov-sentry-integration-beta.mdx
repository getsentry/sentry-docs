  The Sentry Codecov Integration allows you to see untested code causing errors - or whether it’s partially or fully covered - directly in the stack trace, allowing you to avoid similar errors from happening in the future.\
\
To use the integration, you need to have the [GitHub integration for Sentry](https://docs.sentry.io/product/integrations/source-code-mgmt/github/) installed and have your test coverage data in Codecov. You also need [Code Mappings](https://docs.sentry.io/product/integrations/source-code-mgmt/github/#stack-trace-linking) to be set up for your GitHub integration. We need this to identify the source code file for showing you test coverage. Want to learn more or have questions?
