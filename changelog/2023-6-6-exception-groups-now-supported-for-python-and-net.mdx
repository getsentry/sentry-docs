  Sentry now handles exception groups for users using `ExceptionGroup` and derived types in Python, or similar classes such as `AggregateException` in .NET.

Within Issue Details, parent-child relationships are now displayed in a section called “Related Exceptions.” This makes it easy to visualize all of the child exceptions and explore each in detail. Because exception groups might represent multiple of the ***same*** exception type, or multiple ***different*** exception types, we’ve also improved Sentry’s issue grouping logic to account for either scenario.

There’s no setup needed outside of upgrading your SDK to a supported version:

* Python: Update your SDK to [version 1.24.0](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/releases/tag/1.24.0) or newer.

* .NET: Update your SDK to [version 3.33.0](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/releases/tag/3.33.0) or newer.

* JavaScript: Coming soon, visit [getsentry/sentry-javascript#5469](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/5469) for the latest updates.

* Self-Hosted Sentry requires [version 23.5.1](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/releases/tag/23.5.1) or newer.
