  Crons now features initial support for adding tracing to check-ins. This will allow you to directly link issues that were created during the run of a scheduled job to their corresponding Monitor check-ins.

Sentry is working internally to add tracing support to all our first party SDK's automatically. To configure your custom SDK to send tracing info, please refer to [this guide](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/check-ins/).
