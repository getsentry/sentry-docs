  Our new integration with Discord enables you to receive relevant issue and metric alert notifications directly in your Discord channels. 

With this integration, you can: 

* Configure the type of alerts sent to Discord

* Get notified about critical issues and metric alerts as they are surfaced by Sentry

* Triage issues through resolving, archiving, and assigning directly from Discord

* Send alerts to multiple Discord servers/channels from a single Sentry project
