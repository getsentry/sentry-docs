  With Version 1.32.0 of our Python SDK we released support for major GraphQL libraries. We now support error monitoring for [Graphene](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/integrations/graphene/), [Strawberry](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/integrations/strawberry/), [Ariadne](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/integrations/ariadne/) and [GQL](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/integrations/gql/). See the [Changelog](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for the full list of new features.
