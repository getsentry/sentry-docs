  With our recently release [Frame Drop](https://docs.sentry.io/product/issues/issue-details/performance-issues/frame-drop/) Performance Issue, Sentry will identify the precise code in your Mobile App that may be causing dropped frames and thus a poor user experience.

Using Profiling data collected from your Mobile App running in production on user devices, Sentry will identify when frames are dropped, find the associated code and surface the details in your Issues feed.

This feature is available for both iOS and Android Native Apps.

Please note that to use Frame Drop Issues, you will need to set up our Profiling product. Please take a look at our [setup guide](https://docs.sentry.io/product/profiling/getting-started/) for instructions.
