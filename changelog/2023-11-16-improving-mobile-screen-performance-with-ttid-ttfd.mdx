  We’ve released a new troubleshooting workflow focused on mobile-centric metrics - specifically TTID (Time to Initial Display) and TTFD (Time to Full Display) for screen load performance. Starting today, you can find Mobile Screens within *Mobile* on the sidebar under *Performance*.

Requirements:

* This release is only available for **Android** and **iOS** native applications

* **Minimum Sentry SDK versions**:

  * Android

    * 5.0 or higher for automatic activity transactions

    * 6.10.0 or higher to capture TTID

    * 6.17.0 or higher to capture TTFD (released March 2023)

  * iOS

    * 3.13 or higher to capture UIViewController transactions

    * 8.4.0 or higher to capture TTID and TTFD (released April 2023)

* **TTFD** requires you to manually wrap the screens you are interested in tracking. You can find more details on how to set this up in our docs
