  Spike Protection now uses an improved spike detection algorithm to better protect you from any sudden quota-depleting spikes. The improved feature will work at a per-project level and inform you when Sentry detects a spike has started and ended.

Please see this [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/discussions/44155) for more details.
