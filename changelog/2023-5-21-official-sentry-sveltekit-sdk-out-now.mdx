  Official support for SvelteKit is now live. The SDK is also supported via our wizard to install our SDK with one line `npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i sveltekit` , adding required configurations for monitoring client and server code, as well as uploading source maps.

To learn more check out our [docs](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/sveltekit/) , and to track our progress, or if you want to give us your thoughts on the SDK support so far, find us in our [GitHub Roadmap Issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/6692).
