  Sentry Profiling allows for precise code-level visibility into your application performance when running in a production environment. You can use Profiling to visualize the stack trace and identify hot code paths in your application, enabling you to quickly address performance problems.

Profiling is integrated into the Sentry Performance product - you can dive into transaction events and view the exact code contributing to a slow span without having to build additional instrumentation.

You can deploy Profiling immediately, with only a few lines of code. Please see our [setup guide](https://docs.sentry.io/product/profiling/getting-started/) for details. Supported platforms at this time include Python, PHP, Node.js, Android and iOS. Note that you must update your account to our latest billing plan to deploy Profiling.
