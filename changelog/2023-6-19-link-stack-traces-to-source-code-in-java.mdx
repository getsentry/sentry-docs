Java devs can now enjoy the same functionality. We have released Java Source context for Android, Backends, and Desktop. We offer plugins for Gradle and Maven, or you can manually set it up using `sentry-cli`.

To learn more check out our docs for [Java](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/java/source-context/) and [Android](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/android/source-context/).
