  We revamped the layout of the Replay Details page for a better viewing experience, especially when viewing replays from mobile devices.

Here are some improvements we made:\
\
\- **Allowed for a larger viewing port for the replay video** by moving the Breadcrumbs and Tags over to the right-hand panel.\
\- **Gave you more information at a glance** by combining DOM event into the Breadcrumbs tab.\
\- **Don't lose debugging context in full-screen mode** - we now have a collapsible Breadcrumbs sidebar and a compact timeline in full-screen mode.\
\- **Provided a clearer picture** of what is happening right before and after the timestamp youâ€™re currently on by giving the ability to zoom in on the timeline.
