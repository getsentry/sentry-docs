  Sentry monitors the p95 of your most common **functions** in your project and creates issues for sustained regressions. You must be sending profiles to see this issue type. See [docs](https://docs.sentry.io/product/issues/issue-details/performance-issues/function-regressions/) for more info.

This is a whole new type of performance issue that automatically highlights metrics that get worse over time.
