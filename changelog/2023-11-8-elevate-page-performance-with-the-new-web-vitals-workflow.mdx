  Now you can optimize page load performance faster with the new Web Vitals workflow.Â 

What's new:

* **Performance Score**: Calculates a single score using web vitals to help you evaluate the performance of your application and its pages

* **Opportunity**: Quickly identify pages that show the greatest potential for improving user experience across your application

* Compare your app to industry standards for a specific web vital (e.g. LCP)

* Effectively drill down to samples of poor web vital performance (e.g. high CLS)

To use Web Vitals, you will need to set up our Performance product. Please take a look at our [setup guide](https://docs.sentry.io/product/performance/getting-started/) for instructions. You can also learn more about this update in our [docs](https://docs.sentry.io/product/performance/web-vitals/)!
