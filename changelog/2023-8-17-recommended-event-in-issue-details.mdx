summary: "Issues are getting smarter! Instead of always showing you the latest event, Sentry curates an event with the most context to give you the best shot at debugging your problem."

  Issue details now default to displaying the most recent and complete event data. With this update, we’ll automatically surface events with an associated replay, profile, or trace to give you all the rich context you need to solve critical problems.

We use the following criteria in determining the recommended event:

* **Recency**: The recommended event is never more than 7 days older than the latest event

* **Relevance**: The recommended event takes into account what terms you've searched for on your way to the issue

* **Content**: The recommended event prioritizes events that contain debugging tools such as replays, profiles, and traces
