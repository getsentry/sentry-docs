  The new Cloudflare Worker-Sentry integration automatically sends errors, exceptions and `console.log()` messages from your Cloudflare Worker to Sentry with no code changes required.

You can also configure [sampling](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/sampling/#configuring-the-transaction-sample-rate) to control the volume of events you want sent to Sentry. This includes selecting the sample rate for different status codes and exceptions.

Read the [docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/sentry-integration/) to learn how you can start monitoring your Cloudflare Workers
