  The new Priority Sort is designed to highlight new and escalating issues. Older issues and issues with fewer recent events are sorted lower on the list. The ranking relies on three primary factors:

\- Relative volume: Escalating issues that have a higher recent volume (relative to their baseline) are ranked higher.

\- Absolute volume: Issues with more event volume are weighted more highly. Recent events are weighted more than old events.

\- Issue age: New issues are prioritized â€” an exponential decay factor halves the weight every 12 hours.
