  We’ve heard your feedback on making stack traces easier to use. So, we’re shipping a set of changes to enhance the debugging experience, and make it easier for you to understand and navigate through stack traces.

* No more `System` tags: visually distinguish `In App` frames by removing the `System` tags and using coloring and font style to identify non-`In App` frames

* Toggle hidden frames: add individual toggles to non-`In App` frames to conveniently expand specific frame stacks without the need to expand the entire stack trace

Ready to try it out? Simply click on `Show [x] more frame(s)` on any non-`In App` frame that includes hidden frames to see the new experience!
