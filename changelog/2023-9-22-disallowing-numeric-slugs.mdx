  We will not allow users to create numeric slugs anymore. What that means is you can’t have a ‘007’ team slug or a ‘000’ project slug anymore!

Why? We want to improve our APIs and that includes making them work with our numeric IDs- so that your API automation scripts don’t break anytime a team member changes any slugs in Sentry. This is why we cannot support numeric slugs.

So please take a look at your [organization](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/), [projects](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/settings/:orgslug/projects/), [teams](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/settings/:orgslug/teams/), and [cron monitors](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/crons/), and ensure you don’t have any numeric slugs. If you do - then Sentry will automatically change these to alphanumeric slugs on 10/10/23. We will use the following formula to do this:

new slug = {object type}-{old slug}-XX (2 digit random hash)

Here’s a list of things for you to review in case you change any slugs:

* All

  * If you are using any automation that calls Sentry APIs you would need to update the automation and replace the old slugs with the new slug

* Organization slug changes

  * For integrations like [Jira](https://docs.sentry.io/product/integrations/issue-tracking/jira/), [Github](https://docs.sentry.io/product/integrations/source-code-mgmt/github/), [Slack,](https://docs.sentry.io/product/integrations/notification-incidents/slack/) etc. any old links linking back to your Sentry account won't be redirected.

  * If you are using Sentry CLI or a [deployment integration](https://docs.sentry.io/product/integrations/#deployment) you will also have to update the SENTRY\_ORG environment variable.

  * If your organization is using SCIM/SAML, you will need to update the SCIM/SAML configuration values for the provider you’re using.

* Project slug changes

  * If you’re using sentry-cli for project configurations like uploading source maps includes SENTRY\_PROJECT slug and needs to be updated

* Team slug changes

  * If they have any custom provisioning for members they might have used team slugs. In that case, they need to replace it with their new slug.

* Monitor slug changes

  * Update your monitor check-ins and job configurations that include this slug
