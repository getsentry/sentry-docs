  Go beyond errors and performance issues and understand when users are frustrated with rage and dead clicks in Session Replay!

![](https://ik.imagekit.io/launchnotes/production/vzdekrneihxyvlnaouhyqzkud9k7#t=0.1)

*Rage and dead click cards are now at the top of your Replays page.*\
\
**Rage clicks:** five or more clicks rapidly on the same element. These clicks signal that your website or app didn't react the way your users expected.\
**Dead clicks:** user clicks on an interactive element that does not result in any page activity (i.e., no DOM changes) after a few seconds. Examples of dead clicks are where a button is broken/unresponsive, or there's misleading UX where a disabled component is still being clicked.\
\
Know where rage and clicks happen within any replay by viewing the [timeline or filtering the DOM Events component](https://docs.sentry.io/product/session-replay/replay-details) to 'Rage & Dead Click'.\
\
These are the prerequisites to use the feature:\
1\. Your org needs to have[ sent replay events](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/session-replay/)\
2\. JavaScript SDK (or related framework) version of [7.60.1](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/releases/tag/7.60.1) or higher
