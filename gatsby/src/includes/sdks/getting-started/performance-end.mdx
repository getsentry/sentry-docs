Performance data is transmitted using a new event type called “transactions,” which you can learn about in [Distributed Tracing](/performance-monitoring/distributed-tracing). To capture transactions, you must install the performance package and configure your SDK to set the `tracesSampleRate` configuration to a nonzero value. The example configuration above will transmit 100% of captured transactions. Be sure to lower this value in production; otherwise, you could burn through your quota quickly.
