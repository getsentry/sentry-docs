### Enrich Error Data

When the SDK sends an event to Sentry, the event is enriched with data to help identify the source of the event. We include data both pertinent to the event as well as what led up to the event. Much of this data is sent automatically - including the error context and environment - as well as the trail of events that happened prior to an issue, which we call breadcrumbs. You don't need to configure these, though you may modify them.
