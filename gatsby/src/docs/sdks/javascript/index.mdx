Add the Sentry SDK as a dependency using `yarn` or `npm`:

```bash
# Using yarn
$ yarn add @sentry/browser

# Using npm
$ npm install @sentry/browser
```

<Include path="sdks/getting-started/configure.mdx" />

```javascript
Sentry.init({ dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___' });
```

<Include path="sdks/getting-started/configure-end.mdx" />

<Include path="sdks/getting-started/verify.mdx" />

For example, in JavaScript, calling an undefined function throws an exception:

```javascript
myUndefinedFunction();
```

<Include path="sdks/getting-started/verify-end.mdx" />

<Include path="sdks/getting-started/capture.mdx" />

By including and configuring Sentry, the SDK automatically attaches global handlers to capture uncaught exceptions and unhandled rejections. Disable default behavior by changing the `onunhandledrejection` option to `false` in your GlobalHandlers integration and manually hook into each event handler and call `Sentry.captureException`  or `Sentry.captureMessage` directly.

By default, Sentry's JavaScript SDK captures unhandled promise rejections, as described in the official ECMAScript 6 standard. Configuration may be required if you are using a third-party library to implement promises.

**Note:** Browsers may take security measures when serving script files from different origins that can block error reporting.

<Include path="sdks/getting-started/enrich-error-data.mdx" />

<Include path="sdks/getting-started/release.mdx" />

Use the `process.env.npm_package_version`:

```js
Sentry.init({ 
dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
release: 'my-project-name@' + process.env.npm_package_version,
});
```

<Include path="sdks/getting-started/release-end.mdx" />

### Upload Source Maps

Sentry supports un-minifying JavaScript via source maps. This lets you view source code context obtained from stack traces in their original untransformed form, which is particularly useful for debugging minified code (for example, UglifyJS), or transpiled code from a higher-level language (for example, TypeScript, ES6).

We **highly recommend** you incorporate source maps with the Sentry JavaScript SDK to receive the full benefit of error tracking and monitoring. Source maps provide stack traces, which will provide more information regarding errors.

When you’re using the Sentry JavaScript SDK, the SDK automatically fetches the source code and source maps by scraping the URLs within the stack trace. However, you may disable the JavaScript source fetching by logging in to Sentry and toggling off `Allow JavaScript source fetching` in your organization's settings for Security & Privacy.

Upload source maps using our Webpack plugin or TypeScript.

<Include path="sdks/getting-started/performance.mdx" />

To get started with performance monitoring using Sentry’s JavaScript SDK, first install the `@sentry/browser` and `@sentry/apm` packages:

```bash
# Using yarn
$ yarn add @sentry/browser @sentry/apm

# Using npm
$ npm install @sentry/browser @sentry/apm
```

Alternatively, instead of `npm` packages, you can use our pre-built CDN bundle that combines both `@sentry/browser` and `@sentry/apm`:

```html
<script src="https://browser.sentry-cdn.com/{% sdk_version sentry.javascript.browser %}/bundle.apm.min.js" integrity="{% sdk_cdn_checksum sentry.javascript.browser latest bundle.min.js %}" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

Next, initialize the integration in your call to `Sentry.init`:

```js
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/browser';
import { Integrations as ApmIntegrations } from '@sentry/apm';
Sentry.init({
  dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
  release: 'my-project-name@' + process.env.npm_package_version,
  integrations: [
    new ApmIntegrations.Tracing(),
  ],
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0, // Be sure to lower this in production
});
```
