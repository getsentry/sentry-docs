title: Enrich Event Data
excerpt: ""
---
When your SDK sends an event to Sentry, the event is enriched with data. This data helps you identify the source of the event and includes information both pertinent to the event as well as a full picture of what led up to it.

- **[Error and Message Capture](/sdks/javascript/errors/capture)** 
    
    Learn more about automatically reporting errors, exceptions, and rejections as well as how to manually capture errors and enable message capture.

- **[Event Context](/sdks/javascript/errors/context)** 

    Learn more about what data is sent with every event, the form the data can take, and how you can modify the defaults. 
    
- **[Breadcrumbs](/sdks/javascript/errors/breadcrumbs)** 

    Learn more about what Sentry uses to create a trail of events (breadcrumbs) that happened prior to an issue. 
    
- **[Environments](/enriching-error-data/environments/?platform=javascript)**

    Learn more about how environments help you better filter issues, releases, and user feedback in the Issue Details page of the web UI.
    
- **[Releases](/workflow/releases/?platform=javascript)**

    Learn more about how to send release data so Sentry can tell you about regressions between releases and identify the potential source.
    
- **[Capture User Feedback](/sdks/javascript/errors/feedback)**

    Learn more about the embeddable JavaScript widget, which requests and collects the user information when an event occurs. Sentry pairs the feedback with the original event, giving you additional insights into issues.
