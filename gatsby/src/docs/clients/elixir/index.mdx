The Elixir SDK for Sentry.

## Getting Started
Getting started with Sentry is a three step process:

1.  [Sign up for an account](https://sentry.io/signup/)
2.  [Install your SDK](#install)
3.  [Configure it](#configure)

<!-- WIZARD -->
## Installation {#install}

Edit your mix.exs file to add it as a dependency and add the `:sentry` package to your applications:

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
    # ...
    {:sentry, "~> 7.0"},
    {:jason, "~> 1.1"},
  ]
end
```

## Configuration {#configure}

Setup the application production environment in your `config/prod.exs`

```elixir
config :sentry,
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  environment_name: :prod,
  enable_source_code_context: true,
  root_source_code_path: File.cwd!,
  tags: %{
    env: "production"
  },
  included_environments: [:prod]
```

The `environment_name` and `included_environments` work together to determine if and when Sentry should record exceptions. The `environment_name` is the name of the current environment. In the example above, we have explicitly set the environment to `:prod` which works well if you are inside an environment specific configuration like `config/prod.exs`.

An alternative is to use `Mix.env` in your general configuration file:

```elixir
config :sentry, dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
   included_environments: [:prod],
   environment_name: Mix.env
```

This will set the environment name to whatever the current Mix environment atom is, but it will only send events if the current environment is `:prod`, since that is the only entry in the `included_environments` key.

You can even rely on more custom determinations of the environment name. It’s not uncommon for most applications to have a “staging” environment. In order to handle this without adding an additional Mix environment, you can set an environment variable that determines the release level.

```elixir
config :sentry, dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  included_environments: ~w(production staging),
  environment_name: System.get_env("RELEASE_LEVEL") || "development"
```

In this example, we are getting the environment name from the `RELEASE_LEVEL` environment variable. If that variable does not exist, it will default to `"development"`. Now, on our servers, we can set the environment variable appropriately. On our local development machines, exceptions will never be sent, because the default value is not in the list of `included_environments`.

If using an environment with Plug or Phoenix, add the following to your Plug.Router or Phoenix.Router:

```elixir
use Plug.ErrorHandler
use Sentry.Plug
```
<!-- TODO-ADD-VERIFICATION-EXAMPLE -->


## Filtering Events

If you would like to prevent certain exceptions, the `:filter` configuration option allows you to implement the `Sentry.EventFilter` behaviour. The first argument is the exception to be sent, and the second is the source of the event. `Sentry.Plug` will have a source of `:plug`, `Sentry.LoggerBackend` will have a source of `:logger`, and `Sentry.Phoenix.Endpoint` will have a source of `:endpoint`. If an exception does not come from either of those sources, the source will be nil unless the `:event_source` option is passed to `Sentry.capture_exception/2`

A configuration like below will prevent sending `Phoenix.Router.NoRouteError` from `Sentry.Plug`, but allows other exceptions to be sent.

```elixir
# sentry_event_filter.ex
defmodule MyApp.SentryEventFilter do
  @behaviour Sentry.EventFilter

  def exclude_exception?(%Elixir.Phoenix.Router.NoRouteError{}, :plug), do: true
  def exclude_exception?(_exception, _source), do: false
end

# config.exs
config :sentry, filter: MyApp.SentryEventFilter,
  included_environments: ~w(production staging),
  environment_name: System.get_env("RELEASE_LEVEL") || "development"
```

## Context and Breadcrumbs

Sentry has multiple options for including contextual information. They are organized into “Tags”, “User”, and “Extra”, and Sentry’s documentation on them is [here](/enriching-error-data/additional-data/). Breadcrumbs are a similar concept and Sentry’s documentation covers them [here](/enriching-error-data/breadcrumbs/).

In Elixir this can be complicated due to processes being isolated from one another. Tags context can be set globally through configuration, and all contexts can be set within a process, and on individual events. If an event is sent within a process that has some context configured it will include that context in the event. Examples of each are below, and for more information see the documentation of [Sentry.Context](https://hexdocs.pm/sentry/Sentry.html#module-filtering-exceptions).

```elixir
# Global Tags context via configuration:

config :sentry,
  tags: %{my_app_version: "14.30.10"}
  # ...

# Process-based Context
Sentry.Context.set_extra_context(%{day_of_week: "Friday"})
Sentry.Context.set_user_context(%{id: 24, username: "user_username", has_subscription: true})
Sentry.Context.set_tags_context(%{locale: "en-us"})
Sentry.Context.set_http_context(%{path: "/my_path/34"})
Sentry.Context.add_breadcrumb(%{category: "web.request"})

# Event-based Context
Sentry.capture_exception(exception, [tags: %{locale: "en-us", }, user: %{id: 34},
  extra: %{day_of_week: "Friday"}, breadcrumbs: [%{timestamp: 1461185753845, category: "web.request"}]]
```

## Fingerprinting

By default, Sentry aggregates reported events according to the attributes of the event, but users may need to override this functionality via [fingerprinting](/data-management/event-grouping/).

To achieve that in Sentry Elixir, one can use the `before_send_event` configuration callback. If there are certain types of errors you would like to have grouped differently, they can be matched on in the callback, and have the fingerprint attribute changed before the event is sent.

An example configuration and implementation could look like:

```elixir
# sentry.ex
defmodule MyApp.Sentry do
  def before_send(%{exception: [%{type: DBConnection.ConnectionError}]} = event) do
    %{event | fingerprint: ["ecto", "db_connection", "timeout"]}
  end

  def before_send(event) do
    event
  end
end

# config.exs
config :sentry,
  before_send_event: {MyApp.Sentry, :before_send},
  # ...
```

## Including Source Code

Sentry’s server supports showing the source code that caused an error, but depending on deployment, the source code for an application is not guaranteed to be available while it is running. To work around this, the Sentry library reads and stores the source code at compile time. This has some unfortunate implications. If a file is changed, and Sentry is not recompiled, it will still report old source code.

The best way to ensure source code is up to date is to recompile Sentry itself via `mix deps.compile sentry --force`. It's possible to create a Mix Task alias in `mix.exs` to do this. The example below would allow one to run `mix.sentry_recompile` which will force recompilation of Sentry so it has the newest source and then compile the project:

```elixir
# mix.exs
defp aliases do
  [sentry_recompile: ["compile", "deps.compile sentry --force"]]
end
```

To enable, set `:enable_source_code_context` and `root_source_code_path`:

```elixir
config :sentry,
  enable_source_code_context: true,
  root_source_code_path: File.cwd!
```
