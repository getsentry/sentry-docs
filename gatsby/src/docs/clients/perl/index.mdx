The Perl SDK is maintained and supported by the Sentry community. Learn more about the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/rentrak/perl-raven).

</markdown></Alert>


## Installation

`Sentry::Raven` is distributed via [CPAN](https://metacpan.org/pod/Sentry::Raven):

```bash
cpanm Sentry::Raven
```

## Configuring the SDK

Create a new instance of the SDK:

```perl
my $sentry = Sentry::Raven->new( sentry_dsn => '___DSN___' );
```

## Reporting Errors

The easiest way to capture errors is to execute code within a block:

```perl
# capture all errors
$sentry->capture_errors( sub {
    ..do something here..
} );
```

For more information, see the [CPAN documentation](https://metacpan.org/pod/Sentry::Raven).
