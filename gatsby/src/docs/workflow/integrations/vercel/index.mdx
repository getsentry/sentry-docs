### Vercel

Vercel is an all-in-one platform with Global CDN supporting static and JAMstack deployment and Serverless Functions. Connect your Sentry and Vercel projects to automatically upload source maps and notify Sentry of release deployment.

**Installation**

1. Visit <https://vercel.com/integrations/sentry/add>

2. Select your account and click "Add".

    **Note that the installation created an internal integration to generate an auth token used in building releases. If the Vercel internal integration is deleted, your Vercel integration will stop working!**

**Project Linking**

1. Select a Sentry project and a Vercel project to link together.

    [{% asset vercel/vercel_link_project.png alt="Sentry modal showing linking Sentry project to Vercel project." %}]({% asset vercel/vercel_link_project.png @path %})

    * This step will generate environment variables in the selected Vercel project. Having these set means you can skip the [CLI Configuration step](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-webpack-plugin#cli-configuration) in the Sentry Webpack Plugin setup. You can see these in Vercel in **Project Settings** > **General** > **Environment Variables**.


    [{% asset vercel/vercel_env_vars.png alt="Sentry modal showing linking Sentry project to Vercel project." %}]({% asset vercel/vercel_env_vars.png @path %})

    * `SENTRY_ORG` - the name of your Sentry organization
    * `SENTRY_PROJECT` - the name of your linked Sentry project
    * `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` - the auth token from the Vercel Internal Integration that was created upon installation
    * `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` - the linked Sentry project's DSN
    * `VERCEL_GITHUB_COMMIT_SHA`, `VERCEL_GITLAB_COMMIT_SHA`, or `VERCEL_BITBUCKET_COMMIT_SHA` - your source code provider's commit SHA, used for creating releases and associating commits

  2. Redeploy your Vercel project in order to trigger a release.

**Usage**

* If you have not already done so, [instrument your code with Sentry]({%- link _documentation/error-reporting/quickstart.md -%}).
* Ensure you have [installed a repository integration]({%- link _documentation/workflow/releases/index.md -%}#install-repo-integration) and added the relevant repository.
* Add the [Sentry Webpack Plugin](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-webpack-plugin) to your configuration. For NextJS, use `next.config.js`.

* If you already have a Vercel project integrated with Sentry, ensure the Sentry project you link is the one you're already using to report errors.

**Uninstallation**

1. The integration must be uninstalled from Vercel. Visit the Vercel integration configuration page (**Organization Settings** > **Integrations** > **Vercel** > **Configurations**) and click "Uninstall" then "Visit Vercel" in the modal that pops up. 

    [{% asset vercel/vercel_uninstall.png alt="Sentry modal showing uninstalling Vercel integration." %}]({% asset vercel/vercel_uninstall.png @path %})

2. Click "Remove Configuration"

3. Delete the internal integration that was created by navigating to **Organization Settings** > **Developer Settings** and clicking the trash can icon next to **Vercel Internal Integration**. You will be prompted to confirm the deletion by entering a string provided in the modal. Enter the string and click "Confirm" to finalize the deletion.
