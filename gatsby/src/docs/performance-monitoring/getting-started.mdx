After this quick setup, you'll have access to [Performance](/performance-monitoring/performance/). This tool will empower you to see everything from macro-level [metrics](/performance-monitoring/performance/metrics/) to micro-level [spans](/performance-monitoring/performance/event-detail/), but you'll be able to cross-reference [transactions with related issues](/performance-monitoring/performance/transaction-summary/), customize [queries](/performance-monitoring/discover-queries/query-builder/) based on your personal needs, and substantially more.
