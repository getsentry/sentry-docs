# Sentry Commit Messages

Follow these conventions when creating commits for Sentry projects.

## Prerequisites

Before committing, ensure you're working on a feature branch, not the main branch.

```bash
# Check current branch
git branch --show-current
```

If you're on `main` or `master`, create a new branch first:

```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b <type>/<short-description>
```

Branch naming should follow the pattern: `<type>/<short-description>` where type matches the commit type (e.g., `feat/add-user-auth`, `fix/null-pointer-error`, `ref/extract-validation`).

## Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

The header is required. Scope is optional. All lines must stay under 100 characters.

## Commit Types

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `feat` | New feature |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `ref` | Refactoring (no behavior change) |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `test` | Test additions or corrections |
| `build` | Build system or dependencies |
| `ci` | CI configuration |
| `chore` | Maintenance tasks |
| `style` | Code formatting (no logic change) |
| `meta` | Repository metadata |
| `license` | License changes |

## Subject Line Rules

- Use imperative, present tense: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
- Capitalize the first letter
- No period at the end
- Maximum 70 characters

## Body Guidelines

- Explain **what** and **why**, not how
- Use imperative mood and present tense
- Include motivation for the change
- Contrast with previous behavior when relevant

## Footer: Issue References

Reference issues in the footer using these patterns:

```
Fixes GH-1234
Fixes #1234
Fixes SENTRY-1234
Refs LINEAR-ABC-123
```

- `Fixes` closes the issue when merged
- `Refs` links without closing

## AI-Generated Changes

When changes were primarily generated by a coding agent (like Claude Code), include the Co-Authored-By attribution in the commit footer:

```
Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

This is the only indicator of AI involvement that should appear in commits. Do not add phrases like "Generated by AI", "Written with Claude", or similar markers in the subject, body, or anywhere else in the commit message.

## Examples

### Simple fix

```
fix(api): Handle null response in user endpoint

The user API could return null for deleted accounts, causing a crash
in the dashboard. Add null check before accessing user properties.

Fixes SENTRY-5678
Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

### Feature with scope

```
feat(alerts): Add Slack thread replies for alert updates

When an alert is updated or resolved, post a reply to the original
Slack thread instead of creating a new message. This keeps related
notifications grouped together.

Refs GH-1234
```

### Refactor

```
ref: Extract common validation logic to shared module

Move duplicate validation code from three endpoints into a shared
validator class. No behavior change.
```

### Breaking change

```
feat(api)!: Remove deprecated v1 endpoints

Remove all v1 API endpoints that were deprecated in version 23.1.
Clients should migrate to v2 endpoints.

BREAKING CHANGE: v1 endpoints no longer available
Fixes SENTRY-9999
```

## Revert Format

```
revert: feat(api): Add new endpoint

This reverts commit abc123def456.

Reason: Caused performance regression in production.
```

## Principles

- Each commit should be a single, stable change
- Commits should be independently reviewable
- The repository should be in a working state after each commit
