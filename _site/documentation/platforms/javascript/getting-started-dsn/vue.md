Additionally, the Vue _integration_ will capture the name and props state of the active component where the error was thrown. This is reported via Vueâ€™s `config.errorHandler` hook.

Passing in `Vue` is optional, if you do not pass it `window.Vue` has to be present.

{% capture __alert %}
Please note that if you enable this integration Vue internally will not call `logError` 
due to a currently know limitation see: [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/8433).  
This means that errors occurring in the Vue renderer will not show up in the developer console.
