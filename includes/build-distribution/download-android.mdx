After downloading, you can install the APK directly on your Android device. You'll need to enable installing apps from unknown sources:

- **Android 8.0 and higher**: Navigate to the Install unknown apps system settings screen to enable app installations from your browser or file manager.
- **Android 7.1.1 and lower**: Enable the Unknown sources setting in Settings > Security.

For more information, see [Android's documentation on unknown sources](https://developer.android.com/distribute/marketing-tools/alternative-distribution#unknown-sources).
