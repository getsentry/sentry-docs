Use the `Sentry.withMonitor()` API to monitor a callback and notify you if your periodic task is missed (or doesn't start when expected), if it fails due to a problem in the runtime (such as an error), or if it fails by exceeding its maximum runtime.

`Sentry.withMonitor()` requires SDK version `7.76.0`.

```javascript
Sentry.withMonitor("<monitor-slug>", () => {
  // Execute your scheduled task here...
});
```

If you are using an SDK version prior to `7.76.0`, you can use the `Sentry.captureCheckIn()` API documented below.
