<Note>

To make it easier to see what's relevant for you, Sentry's Performance landing page is now being split into separate <a href="/product/insights/frontend/" target="_blank">Frontend</a>,  <a href="/product/insights/backend/" target="_blank">Backend</a>, <a href="/product/insights/mobile/" target="_blank">Mobile</a>, and
 <a href="/product/insights/ai/" target="_blank">AI</a> performance pages. They can all be found in the **Insights** tab.
