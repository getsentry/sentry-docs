<Alert level="warning" title="Upcoming API Changes">
We will be updating our API to ensure that metrics are explicitly connected to spans. This change will improve debugging capabilities by ensuring that metrics are always contextually linked with all your Sentry data through traces. You will eventually need to migrate to the new APIs once released.[Learn more](https://help.sentry.io/product-features/other/metrics-beta-faqs/).
