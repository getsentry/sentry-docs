## Using with Game Engines

If you're using Unity or Unreal Engine, use the game engine specific SDK instead of integrating the console SDK directly. The game engine SDKs wrap the console SDK and provide engine-specific features:

- [Sentry SDK for Unity on consoles](/platforms/unity/game-consoles/) - captures C# exceptions and syncs context with native crashes
- [Sentry SDK for Unreal Engine on consoles](/platforms/unreal/game-consoles/) - provides C++ and Blueprint APIs on top of the console SDK

For custom engines or native C++ games, integrate the console SDK directly as described above.
