You can get started using Sentry on PlayStation without any changes to your game, on devkits as well as retail devices.

Configuration can be done in your Sentry project settings, on a new page called PlayStation that is made available to you once the middleware verification process is done.

The verification process starts [inside the PlayStation Partners website](https://game.develop.playstation.net/tm/verify/functionalsw) where you can confirm your developer status by clicking on *Confirm status*. 
We'll receive your request and get back to you with the next steps.


Even though crash dump collection doesn't require a Sentry SDK, if you add it, you can get additional context in your crash dumps, as well as capture non-fatal events.
Sentry offers SDK support specifically for PlayStation so you can add context such as [breadcrumbs](/product/issues/issue-details/breadcrumbs/) and [tags](/product/issues/issue-details/#tags).
