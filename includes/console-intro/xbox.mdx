You can get started using Sentry by [requesting Microsoft Game Development Kit (GDK) Middleware access](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/support/request-gdkx-middleware).
We'll receive your request and get back to you with the next steps.

Support is available on Xbox Series X and S, by adding the Sentry SDK to your game. 
Crash collection as well as non-fatal events can be captured, on devkits as well as retail devices.
