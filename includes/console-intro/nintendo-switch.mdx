You can get started using Sentry in your Nintendo Switch 1 or 2 games without any code changes or new releases.

It can be done directly on Nintendo's [CRPORTAL](https://crash-report.wc.lp1.er.srv.nintendo.net/sentry/get_started),
where you can configure Nintendo's servers to start forwarding your crashes directly to Sentry on your behalf.

If you want to add additional context on your crash dumps, or you want to capture non-fatal events, Sentry offers SDK support specifically for Nintendo Switch.
It allows for adding additional context such as [breadcrumbs](/product/issues/issue-details/breadcrumbs/) and [tags](/product/issues/issue-details/#tags).
To get access to the SDK, please reach out via the [Nintendo Developer Authorization](https://developer.nintendo.com/group/development/getting-started/g1kr9vj6/middleware/sentry) form.
