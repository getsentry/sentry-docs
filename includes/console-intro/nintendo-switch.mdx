You can get started using Sentry on Nintendo Switch without any changes to your game, on devkits as well as retail devices.

It can be done directly on Nintendo's CRPORTAL. The two environments available are [lp1 for retail devices](https://crash-report.wc.lp1.er.srv.nintendo.net/sentry/get_started) 
and [dd1 for devkits](https://crash-report.wc.dd1.er.srv.nintendo.net/sentry/get_started).
In both cases you can configure Nintendo's servers to start forwarding your crashes directly to Sentry.

If you want to add additional context to your crash dumps, or you want to capture non-fatal events, Sentry offers an SDK specifically for Nintendo Switch.
It allows for adding additional context such as [breadcrumbs](/product/issues/issue-details/breadcrumbs/) and [tags](/product/issues/issue-details/#tags).
To get access to the SDK, please reach out via the [Nintendo Developer Authorization](https://developer.nintendo.com/group/development/getting-started/g1kr9vj6/middleware/sentry) form. 

Support for Switch 2 as well as the original Switch is available.
