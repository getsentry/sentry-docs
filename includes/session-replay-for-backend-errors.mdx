## Replays for Backend Errors

Replays are integrated with Sentry's tracing data model, enabling you to see replays associated with backend errors. For these replays, you can view backend errors in the Timeline, the Breadcrumbs and Errors tabs, and other places when you go to the **Replay Details** view. You'll also see a Replays tab and replay previews in the **Issue Details** page for any backend error that has a linked replay.

To see replays for backend errors, you need to have Sentry set up for both your frontend and backend, along with [distributed tracing](/product/sentry-basics/concepts/tracing/). This provides end-to-end data connectivity on your APIs, allowing Sentry to link replays to backend endpoints.
