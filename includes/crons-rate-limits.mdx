## Rate Limits

To prevent abuse and resource overuse, Crons limits check-ins to **6 per minute for each monitor environment**.

For example, if you have a monitor called "database-backup" with two environments:

- `database-backup` in environment `production` can send up to 6 check-ins per minute
- `database-backup` in environment `staging` can also send up to 6 check-ins per minute
- Combined, they can send up to 12 check-ins per minute

You can verify if any check-ins are being dropped by visiting the [Usage Stats](/product/stats/#usage-stats) page. To avoid dropped check-ins, ensure your monitors don't exceed the rate limit.
