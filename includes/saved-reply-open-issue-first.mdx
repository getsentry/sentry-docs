<CopyableCard title="Open an issue first (behavior/refactor -> close)">

Thanks for the contribution! We ask that behavioral changes and refactors have a linked issue so we can discuss the approach before a PR is opened. Could you open an issue describing the problem you're solving and your proposed approach? Closing this for now - happy to revisit once there's an issue to reference.

Please also have a look at our CONTRIBUTING.md for more PR guidelines.
