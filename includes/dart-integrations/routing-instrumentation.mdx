Sentry's routing instrumentation for Flutter automatically tracks and reports page navigation events in your app.
It supports both [traditional Flutter routing](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/navigation) and the [GoRouter](https://pub.dev/packages/go_router) package.

<Alert>

The routing instrumentation feature is shipped with Sentry's Flutter SDK automatically.

</Alert>

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure:

1. The Sentry Flutter SDK `9.1.0` or later is installed.
2. The Sentry Flutter SDK is initialized. Learn more [here](/platforms/dart/guides/flutter/#configure).
3. Tracing is set up. Learn more [here](/platforms/dart/guides/flutter/tracing/).

## Configure

### 1. Add `SentryNavigationObserver`

Add an instance of `SentryNavigationObserver` to your application's `navigatorObservers`.

```dart {14-16} {tabTitle: Flutter Routing}
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  await SentryFlutter.init((options) {
    options.dsn = '___DSN___';
  }, appRunner: () => runApp(SentryWidget(child: MyApp())));
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
        navigatorObservers: [
          SentryNavigatorObserver(),
        ],
        ...
    );
  }
}
```

```dart {9} {tabTitle: GoRouter}
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';
import 'package:go_router/go_router.dart';

final _router = GoRouter(
  routes: [
    ...
  ],
  observers: [SentryNavigatorObserver()],
);

Future<void> main() async {
  await SentryFlutter.init((options) {
    options.dsn = '___DSN___';
  }, appRunner: () => runApp(SentryWidget(child: MyApp())));
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp.router(
      routerConfig: _router,
    );
  }
}

```

### 2. Define Route Names

By default the application's main route name is `"/"`.
The instrumentation sets the span `operation` to `navigation` and the span `name` to the provided route name.
For transactions to be created and breadcrumbs to be added when navigation changes, you need to provide route names:

- Flutter routing: use `RouteSettings` and set the name in the constructor.
- GoRouter: use the `name` parameter to set the route name.

<Alert>

Make sure that you set the route name for all routes.
If you do not set the route name, the SDK will not instrument performance insights such as [TTID](/platforms/dart/guides/flutter/integrations/routing-instrumentation/#time-to-initial-display) or [TTFD](/platforms/dart/guides/flutter/integrations/routing-instrumentation/#time-to-full-display) or create breadcrumbs for the route.

</Alert>

```dart {tabTitle: Flutter Routing}
MaterialPageRoute(
  builder: (BuildContext context) => MyWidget(),
  settings: RouteSettings(name: 'My Widget'),
)
```

```dart {tabTitle: GoRouter}
GoRoute(
  path: 'mywidget',
  name: 'My Widget',
  builder: (BuildContext context, GoRouterState state) {
    return const MyWidget();
  }
)
```

## Time to Initial Display

Time to initial display (TTID) provides insight into how long it takes your Widget to launch and draw their first frame. 
This is measured by adding a span for navigation to a Widget. 
The SDK then sets the span operation to `ui.load.initial-display` and the span description to the Widget's route name, followed by initial display (for example, `MyWidget initial display`).

TTID is enabled by default.

## Time to Full Display

Time to full display (TTFD) provides insight into how long it would take your Widget to launch and load all of its content. 
This is measured by adding a span for each navigation to a Widget. 
The SDK then sets the span operation to `ui.load.full-display` and the span description to the Widget's route name, followed by full display (for example, `MyWidget full display`).

TTFD is disabled by default. To enable TTFD measurements, follow these steps:

### 1. Enable the `enableTimeToFullDisplayTracing` option in the SDK configuration

```dart {4}
await SentryFlutter.init(
  (options) {
    options.dsn = '___DSN___';
    options.enableTimeToFullDisplayTracing = true;
  }, appRunner: () => runApp(SentryWidget(child: MyApp())),
);
```

### 2. Report the TTFD span

There are two ways to report when your widget is fully displayed:

#### 1. Wrap with `SentryDisplayWidget`

Embed your target widget in `SentryDisplayWidget` and call `reportFullyDisplayed()` from its state.

#### 2. Call the API directly

Retrieve the current display span via `SentryFlutter.currentDisplay()` in `initState()` and call `reportFullyDisplayed()` when ready — no wrapper needed.


<Alert>

**Important for `StatelessWidget`:**

Always use Method 1 (wrapping) if you're navigating to a `StatelessWidget`. 
`SentryDisplayWidget` automatically reports TTFD as soon as the build completes - this is the same as TTID. 
You do not need to call `reportFullyDisplayed()` yourself.

</Alert>

```dart {5, 13-18} {tabTitle: Wrap with SentryDisplayWidget}
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(
    settings: const RouteSettings(name: 'MyWidget'),
    builder: (context) => SentryDisplayWidget(child: MyWidget()),
  ),
);

// Inside MyWidget’s State:
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  // Do some long running work...
  Future.delayed(const Duration(seconds: 3), () {
    if (mounted) {
      SentryDisplayWidget.of(context).reportFullyDisplayed();
    }
  });
}
```

```dart {14, 13-18} {tabTitle: Use the API Directly}
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(
    settings: const RouteSettings(name: 'MyWidget'),
    builder: (context) => MyWidget(),
  ),
);

// Inside MyWidget’s State:
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  // Get a reference to the current display before doing work.
  final currentDisplay = SentryFlutter.currentDisplay();
  // Do some long running work...
  Future.delayed(const Duration(seconds: 3), () {
    currentDisplay?.reportFullyDisplayed();
  });
}
```

If the span finishes through the API, its status will be set to `SpanStatus.OK`.

If the span doesn't finish after 30 seconds, it will be finished by the SDK automatically, and its status will be set to `SpanStatus.DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`. In this case, its duration will match the TTID span.

## Verify

### 1. Implement a Test Widget:

Set up a new widget that executes an expensive operation.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';

class MyWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  const MyWidget({super.key});

  @override
  MyWidgetState createState() => MyWidgetState();
}

class MyWidgetState extends State<MyWidget> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    Future.delayed(const Duration(seconds: 3), () {
      if (mounted) {
        SentryDisplayWidget.of(context).reportFullyDisplayed();
      }
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ...
  }
}
```

### 2. Navigate to the Widget:

Use the navigator to transition to your widget. This should create and send a transaction named after the widget's route.

```dart {tabTitle: Flutter Routing}
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'my_widget.dart';

/// Push to a new screen
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(
    settings: const RouteSettings(name: 'MyWidget'),
    builder: (context) => SentryDisplayWidget(child: MyWidget()),
  ),
);
```

```dart {tabTitle: GoRouter}
import 'package:go_router/go_router.dart';
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

context.push('/mywidget')
```

Log into [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and open your project's performance page to see the transaction `MyWidget`.

## Additional Configuration

### Auto Finish Time

Adjust the duration before a routing transaction automatically finishes. The default is 3 seconds.

```dart
SentryNavigatorObserver(
  autoFinishAfter: Duration(seconds: 5)
)
```

When configuring the `autoFinishAfter` parameter, consider the following behaviours:

- Started child spans will be attached to the navigation transaction - for example the `MyWidget` transaction.
- If child spans finish after the `autoFinishAfter` time, the transaction extends and finishes when all child spans finished.
- If child spans finish before the `autoFinishAfter` time, the transaction's end time will be set to the last child end time.

### Breadcrumb Tracking Only

Set `enableAutoTransactions` to `false` if you only want to track navigation breadcrumbs.
Enabled by default.

```dart
SentryNavigatorObserver(
  enableAutoTransactions: false,
)
```

### Ignore Routes

Set `ignoreRoutes` if you want routes to be ignored and not processed by the navigation observer.
Empty by default.

```dart
SentryNavigatorObserver(
  ignoreRoutes: ["/ignoreThisRoute", "/my/ignored/route"],
)
```

### Override Transaction Name

Set `setRouteNameAsTransaction` to `true` to override the transaction name with the route name.
An existing transaction in the scope 'CustomTransaction' will be renamed to 'MyWidget' for example.
Disabled by default.

```dart
SentryNavigatorObserver(
  setRouteNameAsTransaction: true,
)
```
