Sentry's routing instrumentation for Flutter automatically tracks and reports page navigation events in your app.
It supports both [traditional Flutter routing](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/navigation) and the [GoRouter](https://pub.dev/packages/go_router) package.

<Alert>

The routing instrumentation feature is shipped with Sentry's Flutter SDK automatically.

</Alert>

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure:

1. The Sentry Flutter SDK `9.1.0` or later is installed.
2. The Sentry Flutter SDK is initialized. Learn more [here](/platforms/dart/guides/flutter/#configure).
3. Tracing is set up. Learn more [here](/platforms/dart/guides/flutter/tracing/).

## Configure

### 1. Add `SentryNavigationObserver`

Add an instance of `SentryNavigationObserver` to your application's `navigatorObservers`.

```dart {8} {tabTitle: Flutter Routing}
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

MaterialApp(
  title: 'My Widget',
  home: MyWidget(),
  navigatorObservers: [
    SentryNavigatorObserver()
  ],
);
```

```dart {6} {tabTitle: GoRouter}
import 'package:go_router/go_router.dart';
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

final router = GoRouter(
  routes: ...,
  observers: [SentryNavigatorObserver()],
);
```

### 2. Define Route Names

By default the application's main route name is `"/"`.
The instrumentation sets the span `operation` to `navigation` and the span `name` to the provided route name.
For transactions to be created when navigation changes, you need to provide route names:

- Flutter routing: use `RouteSettings` and set the name in the constructor.
- GoRouter: use the `name` parameter to set the route name.

```dart {4} {tabTitle: Flutter Routing}
/// Setting the route name is required
MaterialPageRoute(
  builder: (BuildContext context) => MyWidget(),
  settings: RouteSettings(name: 'My Widget'),
)
```

```dart {13} {tabTitle: GoRouter}
final GoRouter _router = GoRouter(
  observers: [SentryNavigatorObserver()],
  routes: <RouteBase>[
    GoRoute(
      path: '/',
      name: 'Home',
      builder: (BuildContext context, GoRouterState state) {
        return const HomeScreen();
      },
      routes: <RouteBase>[
        GoRoute(
          path: 'mywidget',
          name: 'MyWidget',
          builder: (BuildContext context, GoRouterState state) {
            return const MyWidget();
          },
        ),
      ],
    ),
  ],
);
```

## Time to Initial Display

Time to initial display (TTID) provides insight into how long it takes your Widget to launch and draw their first frame. This is measured by adding a span for navigation to a Widget. The SDK then sets the span operation to `ui.load.initial-display` and the span description to the Widget's route name, followed by initial display (for example, `MyWidget initial display`).

## Time to Full Display

Time to full display (TTFD) provides insight into how long it would take your Widget to launch and load all of its content. This is measured by adding a span for each navigation to a Widget. The SDK then sets the span operation to `ui.load.full-display` and the span description to the Widget's route name, followed by full display (for example, `MyWidget full display`).

TTFD is disabled by default. To enable TTFD measurements, follow these steps:

1. Enable the `enableTimeToFullDisplayTracing` option in the SDK configuration:

```dart {4}
await SentryFlutter.init(
  (options) {
    options.dsn = '___DSN___';
    options.enableTimeToFullDisplayTracing = true;
  }, appRunner: () => runApp(MyApp()),
);
```

2. Report the TTFD span in the widget that you navigate to - there are two ways to do this:

- Method 1: wrap your widget that you navigate to in `SentryDisplayWidget`
- Method 2: use the API directly to report TTFD - this does not require wrapping your widget with `SentryDisplayWidget`

<Alert>

If you navigate to a `StatelessWidget` you must use method 1 and wrap the widget in `SentryDisplayWidget`.
Wrapping a `StatelessWidget` in `SentryDisplayWidget` will automatically report the same time as TTID because the widget does not depend on any async operations to build.

</Alert>

```dart {5, 15-17} {tabTitle: Method 1: wrap Your Widget in SentryDisplayWidget}
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(
    settings: const RouteSettings(name: 'MyWidget'),
    builder: (context) => SentryDisplayWidget(child: MyWidget()),
  ),
);

// Within the widget state:
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  // Do some long running work...
  Future.delayed(const Duration(seconds: 3), () {
    if (mounted) {
      SentryDisplayWidget.of(context).reportFullyDisplayed();
    }
  });
}
```

```dart {14, 16} {tabTitle: Method 2: use the API directly}
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(
    settings: const RouteSettings(name: 'MyWidget'),
    builder: (context) => MyWidget(),
  ),
);

// Within the widget state:
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  // Get a reference to the current display before doing work.
  final currentDisplay = SentryFlutter.currentDisplay();
  // Do some long running work...
  Future.delayed(const Duration(seconds: 3), () {
    currentDisplay?.reportFullyDisplayed();
  });
}
```

If the span finishes through the API, its status will be set to `SpanStatus.OK`.

If the span doesn't finish after 30 seconds, it will be finished by the SDK automatically, and its status will be set to `SpanStatus.DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`. In this case, its duration will match the TTID span.

## Verify

### 1. Implement a Test Widget:

Set up a new widget that executes an expensive operation.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';

class MyWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  const MyWidget({super.key});

  @override
  MyWidgetState createState() => MyWidgetState();
}

class MyWidgetState extends State<MyWidget> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    Future.delayed(const Duration(seconds: 3), () {
      if (mounted) {
        SentryDisplayWidget.of(context).reportFullyDisplayed();
      }
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ...
  }
}
```

### 2. Navigate to the Widget:

Use the navigator to transition to your widget. This should create and send a transaction named after the widget's route.

```dart {tabTitle: Flutter Routing}
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'my_widget.dart';

/// Push to a new screen
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(
    settings: const RouteSettings(name: 'MyWidget'),
    builder: (context) => SentryDisplayWidget(child: MyWidget()),
  ),
);
```

```dart {tabTitle: GoRouter}
import 'package:go_router/go_router.dart';
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

context.push('/mywidget')
```

Log into [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and open your project's performance page to see the transaction `MyWidget`.

## Additional Configuration

### Auto Finish Time

Adjust the duration before a routing transaction automatically finishes. The default is 3 seconds.

```dart
SentryNavigatorObserver(
  autoFinishAfter: Duration(seconds: 5)
)
```

When configuring the `autoFinishAfter` parameter, consider the following behaviours:

- Started child spans will be attached to the navigation transaction - for example the `MyWidget` transaction.
- If child spans finish after the `autoFinishAfter` time, the transaction extends and finishes when all child spans finished.
- If child spans finish before the `autoFinishAfter` time, the transaction's end time will be set to the last child end time.

### Breadcrumb Tracking Only

Set `enableAutoTransactions` to `false` if you only want to track navigation breadcrumbs.
Enabled by default.

```dart
SentryNavigatorObserver(
  enableAutoTransactions: false,
)
```

### Ignore Routes

Set `ignoreRoutes` if you want routes to be ignored and not processed by the navigation observer.
Empty by default.

```dart
SentryNavigatorObserver(
  ignoreRoutes: ["/ignoreThisRoute", "/my/ignored/route"],
)
```

### Override Transaction Name

Set `setRouteNameAsTransaction` to `true` to override the transaction name with the route name.
An existing transaction in the scope 'CustomTransaction' will be renamed to 'MyWidget' for example.
Disabled by default.

```dart
SentryNavigatorObserver(
  setRouteNameAsTransaction: true,
)
```
