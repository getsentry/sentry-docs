description: "Integrate Sentry with the Dart Logging package to capture events, breadcrumbs, and automatically send structured logs to Sentry."
caseStyle: canonical
supportLevel: production
sidebar_order: 3
platforms:
  - dart
  - flutter
---

This integration connects Sentry with the popular [Dart logging package](https://pub.dev/packages/logging), providing the following capabilities:

- If `enableLogs` is set to `true`, Sentry will send your log messages as [Sentry Structured Logs](/platforms/dart/logs/) (new in `9.5.0`)
- Captures breadcrumbs from your log calls
- Converts error-level logs into Sentry error events
- Works with your existing logging code

## Install

To add the Logging integration, add the `sentry_logging` dependency.

```yml {filename:pubspec.yaml}
dependencies:
  sentry: ^{{@inject packages.version('sentry.dart', '6.3.0') }}
  sentry_logging: ^{{@inject packages.version('sentry.dart.logging', '6.3.0') }}
  logging: ^1.0.2
```

## Configure

Add the `LoggingIntegration` to your `Sentry.init` call:

```dart
import 'package:sentry_logging/sentry_logging.dart';
import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  await Sentry.init(
    (options) {
      options.dsn = '___PUBLIC_DSN___';
      options.addIntegration(LoggingIntegration());
      // If you want to enable sending structured logs, set `enableLogs` to `true`
      options.enableLogs = true;
    },
    appRunner: initApp, // Init your App.
  );
}
```

### Configuration Options

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `minBreadcrumbLevel` | `Level.INFO` | Minimum level for creating breadcrumbs |
| `minEventLevel` | `Level.SEVERE` | Minimum level for creating error events |
| `minSentryLogLevel` | `Level.INFO` | Minimum level for sending structured logs (requires `enableLogs` to be `true`) |

You can customize which log levels trigger different Sentry features:

```dart
await Sentry.init(
  (options) {
    options.dsn = '___PUBLIC_DSN___';
    options.addIntegration(LoggingIntegration(
      minBreadcrumbLevel: Level.INFO,    // Breadcrumbs for INFO and above
      minEventLevel: Level.SEVERE,       // Error events for SEVERE and above  
      minSentryLogLevel: Level.INFO,     // Structured logs for INFO and above
    ));
  },
  appRunner: initApp,
);
```

## Verify

Add the following snippet to your app and execute it to verify that Sentry is capturing your logs:

```dart
import 'package:logging/logging.dart';

void testLogging() {
  final log = Logger('MyAwesomeLogger');

  // This creates a breadcrumb AND a structured log (Level.INFO >= defaults)
  log.info('User logged in successfully');
  
  // This creates a breadcrumb AND a structured log (Level.WARNING >= defaults)  
  log.warning('Rate limit approaching');

  try {
    throw StateError('Something went wrong');
  } catch (error, stackTrace) {
    // This creates a breadcrumb, structured log, AND error event (Level.SEVERE >= all defaults)
    log.severe('Critical error occurred', error, stackTrace);
  }
}
```

### What You'll See in Sentry:
- **Breadcrumbs**: All three log calls appear as breadcrumbs on the error event
- **Error Event**: The `severe` log creates a full error event with stack trace
- **Structured Logs**: (if `enableLogs` is `true`) Navigate to **Logs** in your Sentry project to see all three entries as searchable structured logs
