The `sentry_dio` library provides [Dio](https://pub.dev/packages/dio) support for Sentry using the [HttpClientAdapter](https://pub.dev/documentation/dio/latest/dio/HttpClientAdapter-class.html). It is able to collect breadcrumbs, run tracing for HTTP requests, and capture events for failed requests.

## Install

To add the Dio integration, add the `sentry_dio` dependency.

```yml {filename:pubspec.yaml}
dependencies:
  sentry: ^{{@inject packages.version('sentry.dart', '6.4.0') }}
  sentry_dio: ^{{@inject packages.version('sentry.dart.dio', '6.4.0') }}
  dio: ^4.0.0
```

## Configure

To instrument Dio with Sentry, call `addSentry()` on your Dio instance as the very last step. 
Perform any other configurations such as adding interceptors, transformers, or a custom HTTP client adapter before calling `addSentry()`.

```dart
import 'package:sentry_dio/sentry_dio.dart';
import 'package:dio/dio.dart';

// 1. Create your Dio instance
final dio = Dio();

// 2. (Optional) Customize Dio as needed
// dio.transformer = ExampleTransformer();
// dio.httpClientAdapter = ExampleHttpClientAdapter();
// dio.interceptors.add(ExampleInterceptor());

// 3. Add Sentry – always LAST
dio.addSentry();
```

## Reporting Bad HTTP Requests as Errors

The `Interceptors` can also catch exceptions that may occur during requests — for example [DioError](https://pub.dev/documentation/dio2/latest/dio2/DioError-class.html).

```dart
import 'package:sentry_dio/sentry_dio.dart';
import 'package:dio/dio.dart';

final dio = Dio();

dio.addSentry();

final response = await dio.get<String>('https://wrong-url.dev/');
```

This is an opt-out feature. The following example shows how to disable it:


```dart {2}
await Sentry.init((options) {
  options.captureFailedRequests = false;
});
```

### Failed Request Status Codes

You can customize which status codes should be considered failed requests by setting the `failedRequestStatusCodes` option when calling `addSentry()`.

```dart
import 'package:sentry_dio/sentry_dio.dart';

final dio = Dio();

dio.addSentry(
  failedRequestStatusCodes: [
    SentryStatusCode.range(400, 404), // Capture 400-404
    SentryStatusCode(500),             // Capture 500
  ],
);
```

**Default Behavior:**

By default, `failedRequestStatusCodes` is set to `[SentryStatusCode.range(500, 599)]`, which captures server errors (status codes 500-599).

### Failed Request Targets

To control which URLs should have failed requests captured, use the `failedRequestTargets` option. This is useful when you only want to capture errors from specific APIs or domains.

The SDK will only capture HTTP client errors if the request URL matches one of the provided targets. Targets can be:

- Strings that appear anywhere in the URL
- Regular expression patterns

```dart
import 'package:sentry_dio/sentry_dio.dart';

final dio = Dio();

// Capture failed requests only from specific domains
dio.addSentry(
  failedRequestTargets: [
    'api.example.com',      // Matches any URL containing this string
    'myapi.com',            // Another domain to track
  ],
);
```

**Default Behavior:**

By default, `failedRequestTargets` is set to `['.*']`, which matches all URLs. This means all failed requests are captured (subject to `failedRequestStatusCodes`).

## Tracing for HTTP Requests

The Dio integration also provides insight into tracing for your HTTP requests done with Dio.

### Instrumentation Behaviour

- The created spans will be attached to the transaction on the scope - if no transaction is on the scope the span will not be sent to Sentry.
- The SDK sets the span operation to `http.client` and the description to request `$METHOD $url`. For example, `GET https://sentry.io`.
- The span finishes once the request has been executed.
- The span status depends on either the HTTP response code or `SpanStatus.internalError()` if the code does not match any of Sentry's SpanStatus options.
- When the HTTP request throws an Exception, Sentry's SDK associates this exception to the running span. If you haven't set the SDK to swallow the exception and capture it, the span and `SentryEvent` will be linked when viewing it on the Issue Details page in sentry.io.

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure:

1. The Sentry Flutter SDK is initialized. Learn more [here](/platforms/dart/guides/flutter/#configure).
2. Tracing is set up. Learn more [here](/platforms/dart/guides/flutter/tracing/).

### Verify

#### 1. Execute the Code

```dart
import 'package:sentry_dio/sentry_dio.dart';
import 'package:dio/dio.dart';

Future<void> makeWebRequestWithDio() async {
  final dio = Dio();
  dio.addSentry();

  // If there is no active transaction, start one
  final transaction = Sentry.startTransaction(
    'dio-web-request',
    'request',
    bindToScope: true,
  );
  final span = transaction.startChild(
    'dio',
    description: 'desc',
  );
  Response<String>? response;
  try {
    response = await dio.get<String>(exampleUrl);
      span.status = const SpanStatus.ok();
    } catch (exception, stackTrace) {
      span.throwable = exception;
      span.status = const SpanStatus.internalError();
      await Sentry.captureException(exception, stackTrace: stackTrace);
    } finally {
      await span.finish();
    }
}
```

#### 2. View the Transaction on Sentry.io

To view the recorded transaction, log into [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and open your project.
Clicking **Performance** will open a page with transactions, where you can select the just recorded transaction with the name `dio-web-request`.
