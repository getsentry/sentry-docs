If you're getting build errors when using any of the JavaScript SDKs mentioning something along the lines of "Cannot find module diagnostics_channel", try to configure your build tool to either externalize or ignore the `diagnostics_channel` module.
The Sentry Node.js SDK uses this built-in module to instrument Node.js fetch requests.
Some older Node.js versions do not have the `diagnostics_channel` API, which may lead to build errors when attempting to bundle your code.

Most bundlers have an option to externalize specific modules (like `diagnostics_channel`):

- [Externals in Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/externals/)
- [External in Vite](https://vitejs.dev/config/ssr-options.html#ssr-external)
- [External in esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/api/#external)
- [External in Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#external)
