<Alert level="warning" title="uWSGI and Sentry SDK">

If you're using uWSGI, note that it doesn't support threads by default. This might lead to unexpected behavior when using the Sentry SDK, from features not working properly to uWSGI workers crashing.

To enable threading support in uWSGI, make sure you have both `--enable-threads` and `--py-call-uwsgi-fork-hooks` on.

</Alert>
