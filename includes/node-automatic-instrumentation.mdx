When performance is enabled through `tracesSampleRate`, `enableTracing` or a `tracesSampler` function, the Sentry SDK will automatically capture spans for the following:

- Incoming requests
- Outgoing HTTP requests
- Database queries made with the following packages:
  - `mysql`
  - `mysql2`
  - `pg`
  - `graphql` (including Apollo Server)
  - `mongo`
  - `mongoose`
  - `ioredis`

The following packages are not automatically instrumented and need to be set up manually:

- `prisma` (see <PlatformLink to="/configuration/integrations/prisma/">Prisma Integration</PlatformLink>)
