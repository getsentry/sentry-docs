### Consola Integration

In `10.12.0` and above of the JavaScript SDKs, we've added support to send logs via the [consola](https://github.com/unjs/consola) logging library.

```js
import { consola } from "consola";

// Create a Sentry reporter for consola
const sentryReporter = Sentry.createConsolaReporter();

// Add the reporter to consola
consola.addReporter(sentryReporter);
```

The `createConsolaReporter` method accepts a `levels` option, which allows you to filter which levels are sent to Sentry. By default all levels are logged.

```js
const sentryReporter = Sentry.createConsolaReporter({
  levels: ["error", "warn"],
});
```
