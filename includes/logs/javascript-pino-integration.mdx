### Pino Integration

In `10.18.0` and above of the JavaScript SDKs, we've added support to send logs via the pino logging library. To add the pino integration, you need to add the `pinoIntegration` to your Sentry initialization.

```js
Sentry.init({
  integrations: [Sentry.pinoIntegration()],
});
```

You can look at the <PlatformLink to="/configuration/integrations/pino">Pino integration documentation</PlatformLink> for more information on the options you can pass to the `pinoIntegration`.
