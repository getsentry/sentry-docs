### Winston Integration

In `9.13.0` and above of the JavaScript SDKs, we've added support to send logs via the winston logging library. Requires `enableLogs: true` in your `Sentry.init` call.

```js
const winston = require("winston");
const Transport = require("winston-transport");

const SentryWinstonTransport = Sentry.createSentryWinstonTransport(Transport);

const logger = winston.createLogger({
  transports: [new SentryWinstonTransport()],
});
```

The `createSentryWinstonTransport` method accepts the following options:

### Filtering Log Levels

Use the `levels` option to filter which levels are sent to Sentry. By default all levels are logged.

```js
const SentryWinstonTransport = Sentry.createSentryWinstonTransport(Transport, {
  // Only capture error and warn logs
  levels: ["error", "warn"],
});
```

### Custom Level Mapping

<AvailableSince version="10.37.0" />

If you use [custom winston log levels](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston?tab=readme-ov-file#using-custom-logging-levels), they won't be sent to Sentry by default because they can't be mapped to Sentry's severity levels. Use the `customLevelMap` option to map your custom levels to Sentry levels (`fatal`, `error`, `warning`, `info`, `debug`, or `trace`).

```js
const customLevels = {
  levels: {
    customCritical: 0,
    customNotice: 2,
  },
};

const SentryWinstonTransport = Sentry.createSentryWinstonTransport(Transport, {
  customLevelMap: {
    customCritical: "fatal",
    customNotice: "info",
  },
});

const logger = winston.createLogger({
  levels: customLevels.levels,
  level: "customNotice",
  transports: [new SentryWinstonTransport()],
});
```
