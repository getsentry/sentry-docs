### Winston Integration

In `9.13.0` and above of the JavaScript SDKs, we've added support to send logs via the winston logging library.

```js
const winston = require("winston");
const Transport = require("winston-transport");

const SentryWinstonTransport = Sentry.createSentryWinstonTransport(Transport);

const logger = winston.createLogger({
  transports: [new SentryWinstonTransport()],
});
```

The `createSentryWinstonTransport` method accepts a `levels` option, which allows you to filter which levels are sent to Sentry. By default all levels are logged.

```js
const SentryWinstonTransport = Sentry.createSentryWinstonTransport(Transport, {
  // Only capture error and warn logs
  levels: ["error", "warn"],
});
```
