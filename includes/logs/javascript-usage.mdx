Once the feature is enabled on the SDK and the SDK is initialized, you can send logs using the `Sentry.logger` APIs.

The `Sentry.logger` namespace exposes six methods that you can use to log messages at different log levels: `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, and `fatal`.

Aside from the primary logging methods, we've provided a format text function, `fmt`, that you can use to add insert properties into to your log entries.
These properties will be sent to Sentry, and can be searched from within the Logs UI, and even added to the Logs views as a dedicated column.

```js
const { info, warn, fmt } = Sentry.logger;

error(fmt`Uh on, something broke, here's the error: '${error}'`);
info(fmt`User '${user.username}' added item '${product.name}' to cart.`);
```

You can also pass additional attributes directly to the logging functions, avoiding the need to use the `fmt` function.

```js
const { trace, debug, info, warn, error, fatal } = Sentry.logger;

trace("Starting database connection", { database: "users" });
debug("Cache miss for user", { userId: 123 });
info("Updated profile", { profileId: 345 });
warn("Rate limit reached for endpoint", {
  endpoint: "/api/results/",
  isEnterprise: false,
});
error("Failed to process payment", { orderId: "order_123", amount: 99.99 });
fatal("Database connection pool exhausted", {
  database: "users",
  activeConnections: 100,
});
```
