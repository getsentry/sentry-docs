<Expandable permalink title='"Sentry not part of build pipeline" error'>

This error means your deployed JavaScript doesn't contain Debug IDs, so Sentry can't match it to uploaded source maps.

**To fix:**

1. Run the wizard to configure source map uploads for your bundler:
   ```bash
   npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i sourcemaps
   ```

2. Verify you're running a **production build** (not dev/watch mode)

3. Check your [Source Maps](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/settings/projects/:projectId/source-maps/) settings show uploaded artifacts
