### Removal of `@sentry/replay` package

The `@sentry/replay` package is no longer required. Instead you can import the relevant methods directly from your SDK. In addition to this, the integration is now functional instead of class-based.

```JavaScript diff
-import { Replay } from '@sentry/replay';
-
 Sentry.init({
   dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
   integrations: [
-    new Replay(),
+    Sentry.replayIntegration(),
   ],
 });
```

### Change of Replay default options (`unblock` and `unmask`)

The Replay options `unblock` and `unmask` now have `[]` as default value. This means that if you want to use these
options, you have to explicitly set them like this:

```JavaScript
Sentry.init({
  integrations: [
    Sentry.replayIntegration({
      unblock: [".sentry-unblock, [data-sentry-unblock]"],
      unmask: [".sentry-unmask, [data-sentry-unmask]"],
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Removal of makeXHRTransport transport

The xhr transport via `makeXHRTransport` transport has been removed. Only `makeFetchTransport` is available now. This means that the Sentry SDK requires the `fetch` API to be available in the environment.

### Removal of the `Offline` integration

The `Offline` integration has been removed in favor of the <PlatformLink to="/configuration/transports/#makebrowserofflinetransport">offline transport wrapper</PlatformLink>

### Removal of `wrap` export

The `Sentry.wrap` export has been removed. There is no replacement API.

### Updated behaviour of `tracePropagationTargets` in the browser

We updated the behaviour of the SDKs when no `tracePropagationTargets` option was defined. As a reminder, you can
provide a list of strings or RegExes that will be matched against URLs to tell the SDK, to which outgoing requests
tracing HTTP headers should be attached to. These tracing headers are used for distributed tracing.

Previously, on the browser, when `tracePropagationTargets` were not defined, they defaulted to the following:
`['localhost', /^\/(?!\/)/]`. This meant that all request targets to that had "localhost" in the URL, or started with a
`/` were equipped with tracing headers. This default was chosen to prevent CORS errors in your browser applications.
However, this default had a few flaws.

Going forward, when the `tracePropagationTargets` option is not set, tracing headers will be attached to all outgoing
requests on the same origin. For example, if you're on `https://example.com/` and you send a request to
`https://example.com/api`, the request will be traced (ie. will have trace headers attached). Requests to
`https://api.example.com/` will not, because it is on a different origin. The same goes for all applications running on
`localhost`.

When you provide a `tracePropagationTargets` option, all of the entries you defined will now be matched be matched
against the full URL of the outgoing request. Previously, it was only matched against what you called request APIs with.
For example, if you made a request like `fetch("/api/posts")`, the provided `tracePropagationTargets` were only compared
against `"/api/posts"`.
