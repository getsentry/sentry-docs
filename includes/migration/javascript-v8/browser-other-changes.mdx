### Removal of `@sentry/replay` package

The `@sentry/replay` package is no longer required. Instead you can import the relevant methods directly from your SDK. In addition to this, the integration is now functional instead of class based.

```JavaScript diff
-import { Replay } from '@sentry/replay';
-
 Sentry.init({
   dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
   integrations: [
-    new Replay(),
+    new Sentry.replayIntegration(),
   ],
 });
```

### Removal of makeXHRTransport transport

The xhr transport via `makeXHRTransport` transport has been removed. Only `makeFetchTransport` is available now. This means that the Sentry SDK requires the `fetch` API to be available in the environment.
