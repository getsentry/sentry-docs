### Deprecation of `Hub` and `getCurrentHub()`

The `Hub` has been a very important part of the Sentry SDK API up until now. Hubs were the SDK's "unit of concurrency"
to keep track of data across threads and to scope data to certain parts of your code. Because it is overly complicated
and confusing to power users, it is going to be replaced by a set of new APIs: the "new Scope API". For now `Hub` and
`getCurrentHub` are still available, but it will be removed in the next major version.

See [Deprecate Hub](./v7-deprecations#deprecate-hub) for details on how to replace existing usage of the Hub APIs.

### Removal of class-based integrations

In v7, integrations are classes and can be added as e.g. `integrations: [new Sentry.Replay()]`. In v8, integrations will
not be classes anymore, but instead functions. Both the use as a class, as well as accessing integrations from the
`Integrations.XXX` hash, is deprecated in favor of using the new functional integrations. For example,
`new Integrations.LinkedErrors()` becomes `linkedErrorsIntegration()`.

For a list of integrations and their replacements, see [the `7.x` deprecation documentation](./v7-deprecations#deprecate-class-based-integrations).

### Removal of `Sentry.configureScope` method

The top level `Sentry.configureScope` function has been removed. Instead, you should use the `Sentry.getCurrentScope()`
to access and mutate the current scope.

```JavaScript diff
- Sentry.configureScope((scope) => {
-  scope.setTag("key", "value");
- });
+ Sentry.getCurrentScope().setTag("key", "value");
```

### `tracingOrigins` has been replaced by `tracePropagationTargets`

`tracingOrigins` is now removed in favor of the `tracePropagationTargets` option. The `tracePropagationTargets` option
should be set in the `Sentry.init()` options, or in your custom `Client`s option if you create them.

```TypeScript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "__DSN__",
  integrations: [Sentry.browserTracingIntegration()],
  tracePropagationTargets: ["localhost", "example.com"],
});
```

### Simplification of Metrics Configuration

In `7.x`, you had to enable the metrics aggregator by setting the `_experiments` option to `{ metricsAggregator: true }`. In addition for browser environments you had to add the `metricsAggregatorIntegration` to the `integrations` array.

```TypeScript
// v7 - Server (Node/Deno/Bun)
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  _experiments: {
    metricsAggregator: true,
  },
});

// v7 - Browser
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [Sentry.metricsAggregatorIntegration()],
});

Sentry.metrics.increment("my_metric");
```

In `8.x` no additional configuration is needed to use metrics APIs.

```ts
// v8
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
});

Sentry.metrics.increment("my_metric");
```

### Removal of Severity Enum

In `7.x` we deprecated the `Severity` enum in favor of using the `SeverityLevel` type as this helps save bundle size, and
this has been removed in `8.x`. You should now use the `SeverityLevel` type directly.

```JavaScript diff
- import { Severity } from '@sentry/types';
+ import { SeverityLevel } from '@sentry/types';

- const level = Severity.error;
+ const level: SeverityLevel = "error";
```

#### Removal of `spanStatusfromHttpCode` in favour of `getSpanStatusFromHttpCode`

In `8.x`, we are removing the `spanStatusfromHttpCode` function in favor of `getSpanStatusFromHttpCode`.

```JavaScript diff
- const spanStatus = spanStatusfromHttpCode(200);
+ const spanStatus = getSpanStatusFromHttpCode(200);
```

### `framesToPop` applies to parsed frames

Errors with `framesToPop` property will have the specified number of frames removed from the top of the stack. This
changes compared to the v7 where the property `framesToPop` was used to remove top n lines from the stack string.

### Removal of `Span` class export from SDK packages

In `8.x`, we are no longer exporting the `Span` class from SDK packages. Internally, this class is now called `SentrySpan`, and it is no longer meant to be used by users directly.

### Removal of `lastEventId()` method

The `lastEventId` function has been removed. See [below](./MIGRATION.md#deprecate-lasteventid) for more details.

### Removal of `void` from transport return types

The `send` method on the `Transport` interface now always requires a `TransportMakeRequestResponse` to be returned in
the promise. This means that the `void` return type is no longer allowed.

```TypeScript diff
// v7
 interface Transport {
-  send(event: Event): Promise<void | TransportMakeRequestResponse>;
+  send(event: Event): Promise<TransportMakeRequestResponse>;
 }
```

### `extraErrorDataIntegration` changes

The `extraErrorDataIntegration` integration now looks at
[`error.cause`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/cause) by
default.

### `transactionContext` no longer passed to `tracesSampler`

Instead of an `transactionContext` being passed to the `tracesSampler` callback, the callback will directly receive
`name` and `attributes` going forward. Note that the `attributes` are only the attributes at span creation time, and
some attributes may only be set later during the span lifecycle (and thus not be available during sampling).

### `getClient()` always returns a client

`getClient()` now always returns a client if `Sentry.init()` was called. For cases where this may be used to check if
Sentry was actually initialized, using `getClient()` will thus not work anymore. Instead, you should use the new
`Sentry.isInitialized()` utility to check this.

### Removal of `addGlobalEventProcessor` in favour of `addEventProcessor`

In `8.x`, we are removing the `addGlobalEventProcessor` function in favor of `addEventProcessor`.

```JavaScript diff
- Sentry.addGlobalEventProcessor((event) => {
+ Sentry.getGlobalScope().addEventProcessor((event) => {
   delete event.extra;
   return event;
 });
```
