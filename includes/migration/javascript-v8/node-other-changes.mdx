### Revamped Application Not Responding Detection

The `enableAnrDetection` and `Anr` class exports have been removed the SDK. Instead you can now use the `Sentry.anrIntegration` to enable <Link to="/platforms/javascript/guides/node/configuration/application-not-responding">Application Not Responding detection</Link>

```JavaScript {4}
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    Sentry.anrIntegration({ captureStackTrace: true })
  ],
});
```

### Removal of `Sentry.Handlers.trpcMiddleware()` in favor of `Sentry.trpcMiddleware()`

The Sentry tRPC middleware got moved from `Sentry.Handlers.trpcMiddleware()` to `Sentry.trpcMiddleware()`.

### Behaviour in combination with `onUncaughtException` handlers in Node.js

Previously the SDK exited the process by default, even though additional `onUncaughtException` may have been registered,
that would have prevented the process from exiting. You could opt out of this behaviour by setting the
`exitEvenIfOtherHandlersAreRegistered: false` in the `onUncaughtExceptionIntegration` options. Up until now the value
for this option defaulted to `true`.

Going forward, the default value for `exitEvenIfOtherHandlersAreRegistered` will be `false`, meaning that the SDK will
not exit your process when you have registered other `onUncaughtException` handlers.
