### Removal of `deepReadDirSync` method

The `deepReadDirSync` method has been removed as an export from the SDK. There is no replacement API.

### Removal of `Sentry.Handlers.trpcMiddleware()` in favor of `Sentry.trpcMiddleware()`

The Sentry tRPC middleware got moved from `Sentry.Handlers.trpcMiddleware()` to `Sentry.trpcMiddleware()`.

#### Removal of Client-Side health check transaction filters

The SDK no longer filters out health check transactions by default. Instead, they are sent to Sentry but still dropped
by the Sentry backend by default. You can disable dropping them in your Sentry project settings. If you still want to
drop specific transactions within the SDK you can either use the `ignoreTransactions` SDK option.
