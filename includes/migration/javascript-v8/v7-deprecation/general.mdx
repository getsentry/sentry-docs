### Deprecate `getIntegration()` and `getIntegrationById()`

_Deprecation introduced in `7.94.0`._

This deprecates `getIntegrationById()` and `getIntegration()` on the client. Instead, use `getIntegrationByName()`. You can optionally pass an integration generic to make it easier to work with.

```TypeScript
const replay = getClient().getIntegrationByName<Replay>("Replay");
```

### Deprecate `Hub`

_Deprecation introduced in `7.110.0`._

The `Hub` has been a very important part of the Sentry SDK API up until now. Hubs were the SDK's "unit of concurrency"
to keep track of data across threads and to scope data to certain parts of your code. Because it is overly complicated
and confusing to power users, it is going to be replaced by a set of new APIs: the "new Scope API".

`Scope`s have existed before in the SDK but we are now expanding on them because we have found them powerful enough to
fully cover the `Hub` API.

If you are using the `Hub` right now, see the following table on how to migrate to the new API:

| Old `Hub` API          | New `Scope` API                                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `new Hub()`            | `withScope()`, `withIsolationScope()` or `new Scope()`                               |
| hub.isOlderThan()      | REMOVED - Was used to compare `Hub` instances, which are gonna be removed            |
| hub.bindClient()       | A combination of `scope.setClient()` and `client.init()`                             |
| hub.pushScope()        | `Sentry.withScope()`                                                                 |
| hub.popScope()         | `Sentry.withScope()`                                                                 |
| hub.withScope()        | `Sentry.withScope()`                                                                 |
| getClient()            | `Sentry.getClient()`                                                                 |
| getScope()             | `Sentry.getCurrentScope()` to get the currently active scope                         |
| getIsolationScope()    | `Sentry.getIsolationScope()`                                                         |
| getStack()             | REMOVED - The stack used to hold scopes. Scopes are used directly now                |
| getStackTop()          | REMOVED - The stack used to hold scopes. Scopes are used directly now                |
| captureException()     | `Sentry.captureException()`                                                          |
| captureMessage()       | `Sentry.captureMessage()`                                                            |
| captureEvent()         | `Sentry.captureEvent()`                                                              |

| addBreadcrumb()        | `Sentry.addBreadcrumb()`                                                             |
| setUser()              | `Sentry.setUser()`                                                                   |
| setTags()              | `Sentry.setTags()`                                                                   |
| setExtras()            | `Sentry.setExtras()`                                                                 |
| setTag()               | `Sentry.setTag()`                                                                    |
| setExtra()             | `Sentry.setExtra()`                                                                  |
| setContext()           | `Sentry.setContext()`                                                                |
| configureScope()       | REMOVED - Scopes are now the unit of concurrency                                     |
| run()                  | `Sentry.withScope()` or `Sentry.withIsolationScope()`                                |

| shouldSendDefaultPii() | REMOVED - The closest equivalent is `Sentry.getClient().getOptions().sendDefaultPii` |

The `Hub` constructor is also deprecated and will be removed in the next major version. If you are creating Hubs for
multi-client use like so:

```TypeScript
// OLD
const hub = new Hub();
hub.bindClient(client);
makeMain(hub);
```

instead initialize the client as follows:

```TypeScript
// NEW
Sentry.withIsolationScope(() => {
  Sentry.setCurrentClient(client);
  client.init();
});
```

If you are using the Hub to capture events like so:

```TypeScript
// OLD
const client = new Client();
const hub = new Hub(client);
hub.captureException();
```

instead capture isolated events as follows:

```TypeScript
// NEW
const client = new Client();
const scope = new Scope();
scope.setClient(client);
scope.captureException();
```

### Deprecate `Sentry.lastEventId()` and `hub.lastEventId()`

_Deprecation introduced in `7.93.0`._

Instead, if you need the ID of a recently captured event, we recommend using `beforeSend` instead:

```JavaScript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/browser';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: '__DSN__',
  beforeSend(event, hint) {
    const lastCapturedEventId = event.event_id;

    // Do something with `lastCapturedEventId` here

    return event;
  },
});
```

### Deprecate `addGlobalEventProcessor` in favor of `addEventProcessor`

_Deprecation introduced in `7.85.0`._

Instead of using `addGlobalEventProcessor`, you should use `addEventProcessor` which does not add the event processor
globally, but to the current client.

For the vast majority of cases, the behavior of these should be the same. Only in the case where you have multiple
clients will this differ - but you'll likely want to add event processors per-client then anyhow, not globally.

In v8, we will remove the global event processors overall, as that allows us to avoid keeping global state that is not
necessary.

### Deprecate `configureScope` in favor of using `getCurrentScope()`

_Deprecation introduced in `7.89.0`._

Instead of updating the scope in a callback via `configureScope()`, you should access it via `getCurrentScope()` and
configure it directly:

```js
Sentry.getCurrentScope().setTag("xx", "yy");
```

### Deprecate `pushScope` & `popScope` in favor of `withScope`

_Deprecation introduced in `7.89.0`._

Instead of manually pushing/popping a scope, you should use `Sentry.withScope(callback: (scope: Scope))` instead.

### Deprecate arguments for `startSpan()` APIs

_Deprecation introduced in `7.93.0`._

In v8, the API to start a new span will be reduced from the currently available options. Going forward, only these
arguments will be passable to `startSpan()`, `startSpanManual()` and `startInactiveSpan()`:

- `name`
- `attributes`
- `origin`
- `op`
- `startTime`
- `scope`

### Deprecate `startTransaction()` & `span.startChild()`

_Deprecation introduced in `7.93.0`._

In v8, the old performance API `startTransaction()` (and `hub.startTransaction()`), as well as `span.startChild()`, will
be removed. Instead, use the new performance APIs:

- `startSpan()`
- `startSpanManual()`
- `startInactiveSpan()`

### Deprecated `transactionContext` passed to `tracesSampler`

_Deprecation introduced in `7.100.0`._

Instead of an `transactionContext` being passed to the `tracesSampler` callback, the callback will directly receive `name` and `attributes` going forward. You can use these to make your sampling decisions, while `transactionContext` will be removed in `8.x`. Note that the `attributes` are only the attributes at span creation time, and some attributes may only be set later during the span lifecycle (and thus not be available during sampling).

### Deprecate `scope.getSpan()` and `scope.setSpan()`

_Deprecation introduced in `7.93.0`._

Instead, you can get the currently active span via `Sentry.getActiveSpan()`. Setting a span on the scope happens
automatically when you use the new performance APIs `startSpan()` and `startSpanManual()`.

### Deprecate `scope.setTransactionName()`

_Deprecation introduced in `7.93.0`._

Instead, either set this as attributes or tags, or use an event processor to set `event.transaction`.

### Deprecate `scope.getTransaction()` and `getActiveTransaction()`

_Deprecation introduced in `7.93.0`._

Instead, you should not rely on the active transaction, but just use `startSpan()` APIs, which handle this for you.
