A list of strings or regex patterns that match error URLs which should exclusively be sent to Sentry. If you use this option, only errors whose entire file URL contains (string) or matches (regex) at least one entry in the list will be sent. As a result, if you add `'foo.com'` to it, it will also match on `https://bar.com/myfile/foo.com`. Keep in mind that this only applies for captured exceptions, not raw message events. By default, all errors are sent.
