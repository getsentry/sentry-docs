A list of strings or regex patterns that match error URLs that should not be sent to Sentry. Errors whose entire file URL contains (string) or matches (regex) at least one entry in the list will not be sent. As a result, if you add `'foo.com'` to the list, it will also match on `https://bar.com/myfile/foo.com`. Keep in mind that this only applies for captured exceptions, not raw message events. By default, all errors are sent.
