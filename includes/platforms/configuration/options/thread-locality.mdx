Read on if you're curious to know how thread locality works for scope data. In .NET, there
are two modes for managing ambient data (which is data that's available in different parts of an application and doesn't need to be passed explicitly through method arguments): a disabled global mode and an enabled global mode. Usually, Sentry will automatically choose the most appropriate mode for your application type. However, this can be overridden by setting [`SentryOptions.IsGlobalModeEnabled`](../../configuration/options/#is-global-mode-enabled) manually.

If global mode is disabled (appropriate for most server-based applications), the
ambient scope data will be stored as an `AsyncLocal` and will flow with the execution
context. Stephen Toub's blog post on [ExecutionContext vs SynchronizationContext](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/pfxteam/executioncontext-vs-synchronizationcontext/)
explains that concept in more detail.

If global mode is enabled (appropriate for desktop applications), ambient scope data will be
stored as a Singleton and available globally. This means you can set context (such as
the user logged into the application) once and it will be sent with all events, regardless
of whether the event was captured on the UI thread or a background thread.
