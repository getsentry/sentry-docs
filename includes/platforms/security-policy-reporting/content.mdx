Sentry provides the ability to collect information on [Content-Security-Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy) violations by setting the proper HTTP header which results in the violation to be sent to Sentry endpoint specified in _report-uri_.

The integration process consists of configuring the appropriate header with your project key’s Security Header endpoint found at **Project Settings > Security Headers**.

## Content-Security-Policy

[Content-Security-Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Security_Policy) (CSP) is a security standard that helps prevent cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking and other code injection attacks resulting from the execution of malicious content in the trusted web page context. It’s enforced by browser vendors, and Sentry supports capturing CSP violations using the standard CSP reporting hooks.

To configure CSP reports in Sentry, you’ll need to send a header from your server describing your policy and specifying the authenticated Sentry endpoint:


```
Content-Security-Policy: ...;
    report-uri https://___ORG_INGEST_DOMAIN___/api/___PROJECT_ID___/security/?sentry_key=___PUBLIC_KEY___;
    report-to csp-endpoint

Report-To: {"group":"csp-endpoint","max_age":10886400,"endpoints":[{"url":"https://___ORG_INGEST_DOMAIN___/api/___PROJECT_ID___/security/?sentry_key=___PUBLIC_KEY___"}],"include_subdomains":true}
Reporting-Endpoints: csp-endpoint="https://___ORG_INGEST_DOMAIN___/api/___PROJECT_ID___/security/?sentry_key=___PUBLIC_KEY___"
```

<Alert title="Compatibility Recommendation">

Though the `report-to` directive is intended to replace the deprecated `report-uri` directive, `report-to` isn't supported in most browsers yet. So for compatibility with current browsers while also adding forward compatibility when browsers get `report-to` support, you can specify both `report-uri` and `report-to` in your Content-Security-Policy (CSP), as well as adding [Report-To](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Report-To) and [Reporting-Endpoints](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Reporting-Endpoints) headers.

</Alert>

Alternatively, you can set up CSP reports to simply send reports rather than enforcing the policy:


```
Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only: ...;
    report-uri https://___ORG_INGEST_DOMAIN___/api/___PROJECT_ID___/security/?sentry_key=___PUBLIC_KEY___;
    report-to csp-endpoint

Report-To: {"group":"csp-endpoint","max_age":10886400,"endpoints":[{"url":"https://___ORG_INGEST_DOMAIN___/api/___PROJECT_ID___/security/?sentry_key=___PUBLIC_KEY___"}],"include_subdomains":true}
Reporting-Endpoints: csp-endpoint="https://___ORG_INGEST_DOMAIN___/api/___PROJECT_ID___/security/?sentry_key=___PUBLIC_KEY___"
```

When defining your policy it is important to ensure that `sentry.io` or your self-hosted Sentry domain is in your `default-src` or `connect-src` policy, or browsers will block requests that submit policy violations.

## Additional Configuration

In addition to the `sentry_key` parameter, you may also pass the following within the query string for the report URI:

`sentry_environment`

The environment name (for example, production).
The environment name is case-sensitive and can't contain new lines, spaces, or forward slashes. It can't be the string "None" or exceed 64 characters.

`sentry_release`

The version of the application.
