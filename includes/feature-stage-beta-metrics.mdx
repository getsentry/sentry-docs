<Note title="Now in beta!">

Sentry Metrics is currently in closed beta, so be gentle - features are still in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.
If you would like to expedite your access, you can sign up for the waitlist [here](https://sentry.io/lp/metrics/).
For any questions or feedback, you can reach us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/bVTkDqE8) or [GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/discussions/64195).
