## Using Sentry SDK with ESM

Instrumentation works out of the box for CommonJS (CJS) applications based on `require()` calls. This means that as long as your application is either natively in CJS, or compiled at build time to CJS (which is the case for most TypeScript apps, for example), everything will work without any further setup.

ECMAScript Modules (ESM) are only supported for Node v18.19.0 onwards.
