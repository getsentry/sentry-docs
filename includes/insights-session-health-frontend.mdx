## Charts

![Insights Frontend Session Health Tab](./common-imgs/img/frontend-insights-session-health.png)

For the Frontend module, the following charts are available:

- Unhealthy Sessions
- Session Health
- Session Counts
- User Health
- User Counts
- [Issues](/product/issues/)

Most of these charts, with the exception of the Issues chart, are based on session-backed data.

The Session Health, Session Counts, User Health, and User Counts charts aim to break down trends in how your sessions are performing status-wise. The status options are healthy, crashed, errored, or abnormal. [Learn more about session statuses](/product/releases/health/#session-status).

The Unhealthy Sessions chart combines the total rate of errored, crashed, and abnormal sessions into one line.

The Issues chart is the only chart that does not rely on session-backed data. Instead, it shows the number of new and resolved issues for that project over time. It also gives a preview of the two most recently seen issues for that project. The chart header, when hovered, contains a link to view all issues for that project.

Click on any option in the graph legend to hide it. In some charts, including the Session Health chart, the healthy series is hidden by default to allow you to automatically see the errored, abnormal, and crashed series in better scale.

The overall chart view can be customized, so that you can display the visualizations you care about most. Simply click the toggle near the chart title to see other charts that can be displayed.

The chart view will be saved into local storage, so when you come back to the page, the chart view you customized before will still be displayed.
