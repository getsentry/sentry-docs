### iOS (Fastlane + GitHub Actions)

<Alert level="info">
  This quick start assumes you're already running Fastlane in GitHub Actions and have authentication configured (for example, with the `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` secret). If you haven't added the [Sentry Fastlane plugin](/platforms/apple/guides/ios/upload-debug-symbols/fastlane/) yet, follow the integration guide first.
</Alert>

1. Install the plugin (version `1.34.0` or higher):

   ```ruby
   bundle exec fastlane add_plugin fastlane-plugin-sentry
   ```

2. Add to your `Fastfile`:

   ```ruby {filename:Fastfile}
   lane :upload_to_sentry do
     sentry_upload_build(
       org_slug: 'your-org',
       project_slug: 'your-project',
       build_configuration: 'Release' # Adjust to your configuration
     )
   end
   ```

3. Run the lane:

   ```bash
   bundle exec fastlane upload_to_sentry
   ```
