Features such as automatically comparing the head build against the base build **will only compare builds of the same build configuration**. This is important to consider when setting up Size Analysis in your CI. For example, `Release` and `Debug` builds can be drastically different depending on the compiler and linker settings used during the build process. Trying to compare the two would give unexpected results.

Sometimes this is expected though, say you want to test the impact of converting your project to use Bazel (e.g. `Release` vs `Release-Bazel`). In this case, it's still possible to perform a manual comparison of builds with different build configurations.
