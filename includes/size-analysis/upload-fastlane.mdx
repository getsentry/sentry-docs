The Fastlane plugin can be used to upload XCArchive or IPA builds to Sentry. Fastlane will automatically detect your [build's metadata](#upload-metadata) and include it in the upload. If for any reason you need to override values, you can... TODO: show fastlane override, maybe at bottom of this?

1. Configure the [Sentry Fastlane plugin](/platforms/apple/guides/ios/upload-debug-symbols/fastlane/) (version `1.34.0` or higher).

   ```ruby
   bundle exec fastlane add_plugin fastlane-plugin-sentry
   ```

2. Set up `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` in your environment (you can generate a token [here](https://sentry.sentry.io/settings/auth-tokens/)).

3. In `FastFile`, add a call to `sentry_upload_build` after your build step:

   ```ruby {filename:Fastfile}
   lane :upload_to_sentry do
      build_ios_app(
        scheme: 'YourScheme',
        configuration: 'Release',
      )
      sentry_upload_build(
        org_slug: 'your-org',
        project_slug: 'your-project',
        build_configuration: 'Release' # Adjust to your configuration
      )
   end
   ```

   4. Confirm your upload's metadata is correct in the Sentry UI. (TODO: pic of sidebar metadata)
