| Insight                     | What it catches                                                                             |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Duplicate files             | Flags identical payloads you can keep once and drop the copies.                             |
| Large videos                | Highlights video files that are bigger than typical delivery budgets.                       |
| Image optimization          | Surfaces oversized PNG/JPEG/HEIC assets and recommends recompressing or converting to HEIC. |
| Alternate icon optimization | Checks alternate app icons for downscaling and recompressing.                               |
| Loose images                | Groups @1x/@2x/@3x variants that should move into asset catalogs.                           |
| Small files                 | Totals tiny files wasting space because of 4 KB filesystem blocks.                          |
| Strip binary                | Shows binaries that still include removable debug sections or symbols.                      |
| Localized strings           | Estimates savings from shrinking `.strings` payloads.                                       |
| Minify localized strings    | Measures wins from stripping comments in `.strings` files.                                  |
| Main binary export metadata | Reports export tries on main binaries that are larger than needed.                          |
| Unnecessary files           | Catches docs, scripts, configs, or other build leftovers in the bundle.                     |
| Hermes debug info (RN only) | Points to bundled Hermes bytecode still carrying debuggers' metadata                        |
