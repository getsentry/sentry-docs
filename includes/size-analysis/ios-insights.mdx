| Strip debug symbols         | Shows binaries that still include removable debug sections or symbols.                             |
| Duplicate files             | Flags identical files where you can keep once and drop the additional copies.                      |
| Image optimization          | Surfaces oversized PNG/JPEG/HEIC assets and recommends recompressing or converting to HEIC.        |
| Alternate icon optimization | Checks alternate app icons for downscaling and recompressing.                                      |
| Loose images                | Flags @1x/@2x/@3x images that should be move into asset catalogs so they qualify for app thinning. |
| Small files                 | Totals tiny files wasting space because of 4 KB filesystem blocks.                                 |
| Unnecessary files           | Catches docs, scripts, configs, or other build leftovers in the bundle.                            |

| Minify localized strings    | Measures wins from stripping comments and whitespace in `.strings` files.                          |
| Main binary export metadata | Reports export tries on main binaries that are not needed.                                         |
| Hermes debug info (RN only) | Show bundled Hermes bytecode with removable debug info.                                            |
