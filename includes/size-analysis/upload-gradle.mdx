The Gradle plugin will automatically detect your [build's metadata](#upload-metadata) and include it in the upload. If for any reason you need to override values, you can... TODO: show gradle override

1. Configure the [Sentry Android Gradle plugin](/platforms/android/configuration/gradle/)

2. Set up `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` in your environment (you can generate a token [here](https://sentry.sentry.io/settings/auth-tokens/))

3. Make sure to use at least version `6.0.0-alpha.6` or higher in your `build.gradle.kts`:

   ```kotlin {filename:build.gradle.kts}
   sentry {
     sizeAnalysis {
       enabled = providers.environmentVariable("GITHUB_ACTIONS").isPresent
     }
   }
   ```

   Or for `build.gradle`:

   ```groovy {filename:build.gradle}
   sentry {
     sizeAnalysis {
       enabled = providers.environmentVariable("GITHUB_ACTIONS").present
     }
   }
   ```

_TODO: the text for #3 doesn't make sense given the code snippet. Shouldn't the version be in #1?_

4. Invoke the following Gradle tasks to build your app and trigger the upload.

   ```bash
   ./gradlew bundleRelease
   # or
   ./gradlew assembleRelease
   ```

5. Confirm your upload's metadata is correct in the Sentry UI. (TODO: pic of sidebar metadata)

_TODO: do we have difference between bundleRelease and assembleRelease anywhere?_

You can see an example of the Gradle plugin in action [here](TODO:LINK).
