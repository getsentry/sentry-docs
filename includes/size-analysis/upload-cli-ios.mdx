1. Configure the [sentry-cli](/cli/)

2. Set up `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` in your environment (you can generate a token [here](https://sentry.sentry.io/settings/auth-tokens/))

3. Build your app to create an XCArchive (preferred) or IPA

4. Invoke the following CLI command to trigger the upload.

```bash
sentry-cli build upload app.xcarchive \
  --org your-org \
  --project your-project \
  --build-configuration Release
```

5. Confirm your upload's metadata is correct in the Sentry UI. (TODO: pic of sidebar metadata)
