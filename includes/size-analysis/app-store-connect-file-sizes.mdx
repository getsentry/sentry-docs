App Store Connect has a feature for `App File Sizes` which provides a report of your app size thinned for various device types. While we strive to be consistent with these numbers, you may see differences between the reported Sentry size and the Apple size. It's important to note that the reported Apple sizes are not consistent with the rest of their tooling, such as the Size Report generated by Xcode, and these are all estimated sizes. You can [learn more about these differences here](https://github.com/EmergeTools/app-store-size-example) for additional information.
