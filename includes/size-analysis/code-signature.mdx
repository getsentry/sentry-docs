App bundles contain code signature data within `_CodeSignature/` directories. In these you'll find a `CodeResources` plist file with hashes of every file within the bundle. Similarly, Mach-O binaries contain additional hashes of every page block within its `LC_CODE_SIGNATURE` load command. This means the size of code signature data will scale linearly with the amount of files in your bundle and size of your binaries.

By default Sentry calculates the size of this data as-is. You may notice differences when comparing against your app downloaded from the App Store. For example, Xcode 26 archives only codesign with `SHA256` hashes, but the App Store can use both `SHA1` and `SHA256` hashes. In other words, App Store downloads of your app may be slightly larger than what's produced by Xcode. This App Store behavior is subject to change at any time.

If you'd like to compare the impact of this on your app, you can re-sign your app before uploading to Sentry:

```bash
# Inspect the current code signature
codesign -dvvv '/path/to/your/app.app'

# Re-sign with a new code signature
codesign --force \
  --sign 'Apple Distribution: Your Team (team_id)' \
  --digest-algorithm sha1 \
  --digest-algorithm sha256 \
  '/path/to/your/app.app'
```

This will force both `SHA1` and `SHA256` hashes to be used.
