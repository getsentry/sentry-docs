If you have [sessions or releases](/product/releases/setup/) enabled on Sentry, you can take full advantage of the Session Health tab on Insights. The Session Health tab contains a variety of data visualizations to help you discover insights about how your sessions are performing. [Learn more about how sessions are defined](/product/releases/health/#sessions).

The charts help you understand trends for crashes and sessions on a per-project level, and the customized chart views and toggleable legends allow you to drill down into the metrics you care about most.

## Prerequisites

You must have [sessions or releases](/product/releases/setup/) enabled in order to view these insights. Session Health on Insights is available only for the Frontend and Mobile modules.
