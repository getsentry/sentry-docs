If you have [sessions and releases](/product/releases/setup/) enabled on Sentry, you can take full advantage of the Session Health tab on Insights. The Session Health tab contains a variety of data visualizations to help you discover insights about how your sessions are performing. A session on most web or mobile applications is created for every page (or view) load and on every navigation change. Read more [here](/product/releases/health/#sessions).

The charts help you understand trends for your sessions over time, and the customized chart views and toggleable legends allow you to drill down into the metrics you care about most.

## Prerequisites

You must have [sessions and releases](/product/releases/setup/) enabled in order to view these insights. Session Health on Insights is available only for the Frontend and Mobile modules.
