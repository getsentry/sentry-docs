<Expandable level="warning" title="Are you using Turbopack?">

The Sentry SDK doesn't yet fully support Turbopack production builds (`next build --turbopack`) as Turbopack production builds are still in alpha.

If you upgraded the Sentry SDK to the latest version and installed Next.js on version `15.3.0` or later, the SDK will capture all data as expected, however, it is currently not possible to apply sourcemaps to Turbopack production builds.

Turbopack in dev-mode (`next dev --turbopack`) is fully supported.

Check the latest information on [Sentry's support for Turbopack on GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/8105).
