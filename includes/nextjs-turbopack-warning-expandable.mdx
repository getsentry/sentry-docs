<Expandable level="warning" title="Are you developing with Turbopack?">

The Sentry SDK doesn't fully support `next dev --turbo` as Turbopack is still under development. This means that the Sentry SDK will not capture any data from your frontend. Other than that, your dev server should be fully operational.

Check the latest information on [Sentry's support for Turbopack on GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/8105).
