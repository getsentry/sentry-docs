### Enabling Minidump Storage

You can enable _Store Minidumps As Attachments_ in your organization or project settings under **Security & Privacy**. By default, this setting is disabled. Determine the maximum number of crash reports that will be stored per issue; disabled, unlimited, or maximum per issue:

<Include name="common-imgs/store-minidumps-as-attachments" />

If you set a limit per issue, as in the example above, a limit of 5, Sentry will store the first 5 attachments associated with this issue, but drop any that follow. To make room for additional attachments, delete them. Sentry will then accept attachments until the limit is reached again.
