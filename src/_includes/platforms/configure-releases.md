A release is a version of your code that you deploy to an environment. When you give Sentry information about your releases, you unlock many new features:

- Determine the issue and regressions introduced in a new release
- Predict which commit caused an issue and who is likely responsible
- Resolve issues by including the issue number in your commit message
- Receive email notifications when your code gets deployed

After configuring your SDK, setting up releases is a 2-step process:

1. [Create Release and Associate Commits](/workflow/releases/#create-release)
2. [Tell Sentry When You Deploy a Release](/workflow/releases/#create-deploy)

For more information, see [Releases Are Better With Commits](https://blog.sentry.io/2017/05/01/release-commits.html).
