title: Integrations
---

For common environments and frameworks like [Rails](#ruby-on-rails), [Rack](#rack-sinatra-etc), and others, Ruby Raven provides automatic integration for reporting. Most of the time you don’t need to change anything, although you can configure those features if you want.

The following integrations are available:

-   Sidekiq (`:sidekiq`)
-   `Delayed::Job` (`:delayed_job`)
-   Rake (`:rake`)
-   Rack (`:rack`)
-   Rails (`:railties`)

## Manually using integrations

Integrations are automatically loaded by default. This can be problematic if the default integration behavior doesn’t suit your projects’ needs.

To explicitly include integrations:

```ruby
require 'sentry-raven-without-integrations'
Raven.inject_only(:railties, :rack, :rake)
```

To blacklist integrations:

```ruby
require 'sentry-raven-without-integrations'
Raven.inject_without(:sidekiq, :delayed_job)
```

If you’re using bundler, then in your gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sentry-raven', require: 'sentry-raven-without-integrations'
```

And in some sort of initializer:

```ruby
Raven.inject_without(:sidekiq)
```

## Ruby on Rails

<!-- WIZARD rails -->
In Rails, all uncaught exceptions will be automatically reported.

We support Rails 4 and newer.

### Installation

Install the SDK via Rubygems by adding it to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "sentry-raven"
```

### Configuration

Open up `config/application.rb` and configure the DSN, and any other [_settings_]({%- link _documentation/clients/ruby/config.md -%}) you need:

```ruby
Raven.configure do |config|
  config.dsn = '___DSN___'
end
```

If you have added items to [Rails’ log filtering](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html#parameters-filtering), you can also make sure that those items are not sent to Sentry:

```ruby
# in your application.rb:
config.filter_parameters << :password

# in an initializer, like sentry.rb
Raven.configure do |config|
  config.sanitize_fields = Rails.application.config.filter_parameters.map(&:to_s)
end
```

### Params and sessions

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  before_action :set_raven_context

  private

  def set_raven_context
    Raven.user_context(id: session[:current_user_id]) # or anything else in session
    Raven.extra_context(params: params.to_unsafe_h, url: request.url)
  end
end
```

### Caveats

Currently, custom exception applications (_config.exceptions_app_) are not supported. If you are using a custom exception app, you must manually integrate Raven yourself.

## Rack (Sinatra etc.)

<!-- WIZARD rack -->
### Installation

Install the SDK via Rubygems by adding it to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "sentry-raven"
```

### Configuration

Add `use Raven::Rack` to your `config.ru` or other rackup file (this is automatically inserted in Rails):

```ruby
require 'raven'

Raven.configure do |config|
  config.dsn = '___DSN___'
end

use Raven::Rack
```
<!-- TODO-ADD-VERIFICATION-EXAMPLE -->
<!-- ENDWIZARD -->

## Puma

### Installation

Install the SDK via Rubygems by adding it to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "sentry-raven"
```

### Configuration

Puma provides a config option for handling low level errors.

```ruby
# in your puma.rb config
lowlevel_error_handler do |ex, env|
  Raven.capture_exception(
    ex,
    :message => ex.message,
    :extra => { :puma => env },
    :transaction => "Puma"
  )
  # note the below is just a Rack response
  [500, {}, ["An error has occurred, and engineers have been informed. Please reload the page. If you continue to have problems, contact support@example.com\n"]]
end
```

## Heroku

### Installation

Enable the `runtime-dyno-metadata` Heroku Labs feature in order to enable automated release detection:

```bash
heroku labs:enable runtime-dyno-metadata -a myapp
```
