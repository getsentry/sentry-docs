The `raven-go` SDK is no longer maintained and was superseded by the `sentry-go` SDK. Learn more about the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go) and check out the [migration guide]({%- link _documentation/platforms/go/migration.md -%}).

Raven-Go provides a Sentry client implementation for the Go programming language.

## Getting Started
Getting started with Sentry is a three step process:

1.  [Sign up for an account](https://sentry.io/signup/)
2.  [Install your SDK](#install)
3.  [Configure it](#configure)

<!-- WIZARD -->
## Installation {#install}

Raven-Go can be installed like any other Go library through `go get`:

```bash
$ go get github.com/getsentry/raven-go
```

## Configuration {#configure}

To use `raven-go`, youâ€™ll need to import the `raven` package, then initialize your DSN globally. If you specify the `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable, this will be done automatically for you. The release and environment can also be specified in the environment variables `SENTRY_RELEASE` and `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` respectively.
More on this in [Configuration]({%- link _documentation/clients/go/config.md -%}) section.

```go
package main

import "github.com/getsentry/raven-go"

func init() {
	raven.SetDSN("___PUBLIC_DSN___")
}
```
<!-- ENDWIZARD -->
