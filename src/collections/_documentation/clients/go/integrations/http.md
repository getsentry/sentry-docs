Raven Go provides middleware that can be used with the stdlib `net/http` library to automatically handle panics that occur during an http request.

## Installation

Simply install `raven-go` through `go get`:

```bash
$ go get github.com/getsentry/raven-go
```

## Setup

Make sure that you’ve set configured `raven` with your DSN, typically inside the `init()` in your `main` package is a good place.

```go
package main

import "github.com/getsentry/raven-go"

func init() {
    raven.SetDSN("___DSN___")
}
```

If you don’t call `SetDSN`, we will attempt to read it from your environment under the `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable. The release and environment will also be read from the environment variables `SENTRY_RELEASE` and `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` if set.

Next, we need to wrap our `http.Handler` with our `RecoveryHandler`:

```go
func root(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // ... do stuff
}
http.HandleFunc("/", raven.RecoveryHandler(root))
```
