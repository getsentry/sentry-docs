## Installation

If you havenâ€™t already, start by downloading Raven. The easiest way is with _pip_:

```bash
pip install raven --upgrade
```

## zope.conf {#zope-conf}

Zope has extensible logging configuration options. A basic instance (not ZEO client) setup for logging looks like this:

```xml
<eventlog>
  level INFO
  <logfile>
   path ${buildout:directory}/var/{:_buildout_section_name_}.log
   level INFO
  </logfile>

  %import raven.contrib.zope
  <sentry>
    dsn ___DSN___
    level ERROR
  </sentry>
</eventlog>
```

This configuration retains normal logging to a logfile, but adds Sentry logging for ERRORs.

All options of `raven.base.Client` are supported.

Use a buildout recipe instead of editing zope.conf directly. To add the equivalent instance configuration, you would do this:

```
[instance]
recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
...
event-log-custom =
 %import raven.contrib.zope
 <logfile>
 path ${buildout:directory}/var/instance.log
 level INFO
 </logfile>
 <sentry>
 dsn ___DSN___
 level ERROR
 </sentry>
```

To add the equivalent ZEO client configuration, you would do this:

```
[instance]
recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
...
event-log-custom =
 %import raven.contrib.zope
 <logfile>
 path ${buildout:var-dir}/${:_buildout_section_name_}/event.log
 level INFO
 </logfile>
 <sentry>
 dsn ___DSN___
 level ERROR
 </sentry>
```
