Attributes are simple data that Sentry understands to provide the most basic
information about events. These are things like the unique ID of an event, the
human readable message etc.

Attributes are separate from [_Interfaces_]({%- link
_documentation/development/sdk-dev/interfaces/index.md -%}) which provide very specific
and tailored data such as exception data, stack traces, etc.

## Required Attributes

The following attributes are required for all events:

`event_id`

: Hexadecimal string representing a uuid4 value. The length is exactly 32
  characters. Dashes are not allowed.

  ```json
  {
    "event_id": "fc6d8c0c43fc4630ad850ee518f1b9d0"
  }
  ```

`timestamp`

: Indicates when the logging record was created (in the Sentry SDK). The Sentry
  server assumes the time is in UTC. The timestamp should be in ISO 8601 format,
  without a timezone.

  ```json
  {
    "timestamp": "2011-05-02T17:41:36"
  }
  ```

`logger`

: The name of the logger which created the record.

  ```json
  {
    "logger": "my.logger.name"
  }
  ```

`platform`

: A string representing the platform the SDK is submitting from. This will be
  used by the Sentry interface to customize various components in the interface.

  ```json
  {
    "platform": "python"
  }
  ```

  Acceptable values are:

  -   `as3`
  -   `c`
  -   `cfml`
  -   `cocoa`
  -   `csharp`
  -   `go`
  -   `java`
  -   `javascript`
  -   `native`
  -   `node`
  -   `objc`
  -   `other`
  -   `perl`
  -   `php`
  -   `python`
  -   `ruby`

`sdk`

: Information about the SDK sending the event. Note that the `integrations` key
  is optional and used to list any of the SDK and language specific integrations
  that the user is actively using.

  ```json
  {
    "sdk": {
      "name": "sentry-java",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "integrations": ["logback", "spring"] // Optional
    }
  }
  ```

## Optional Attributes

Additionally, there are several optional values which Sentry recognizes and are
highly encouraged:

`level`

: The record severity.

  Defaults to `error`.

  The value needs to be one on the supported level string values.

  ```json
  {
    "level": "warning"
  }
  ```

  Acceptable values are:

  -   `fatal`
  -   `error`
  -   `warning`
  -   `info`
  -   `debug`

`transaction`

: The name of the transaction which caused this exception

  For example, in a web app, this might be the route name: `/welcome/`

  ```json
  {
    "transaction": "/users/<username>/"
  }
  ```

`culprit`

: The name of the culprit which caused this exception. This attribute is
  deprecated.

`server_name`

: Identifies the host SDK from which the event was recorded.

  ```json
  {
    "server_name": "foo.example.com"
  }
  ```

`release`

: The release version of the application.

  This value will generally be something along the lines of the git SHA for the
  given project.

  ```json
  {
    "release": "721e41770371db95eee98ca2707686226b993eda"
  }
  ```

`tags`

: A map or list of tags for this event.

  ```json
  {
    "tags": {
      "ios_version": "4.0",
      "context": "production"
    }
  }
  ```

`environment`

: The environment name, such as `production` or `staging`.

  ```json
  {
    "environment": "production"
  }
  ```

  {% version_added Sentry: 8.0 %}

`modules`

: A list of relevant modules and their versions.

  ```json
  {
    "modules": {
      "my.module.name": "1.0"
    }
  }
  ```

`extra`

: An arbitrary mapping of additional metadata to store with the event.

  ```json
  {
    "extra": {
      "my_key": 1,
      "some_other_value": "foo bar"
    }
  }
  ```

`fingerprint`

: A list of strings used to dictate the deduplication of this event. A value
  of `{% raw %}{{ default }}{% endraw %}` will be replaced with the built-in
  behavior, thus allowing you to extend it, or completely replace it.

  ```json
  {
    "fingerprint": [
      "myrpc",
      "POST",
      "/foo.bar"
    ]
  }
  ```

  ```json
  {% raw %}{
    "fingerprint": [
      "{{ default }}",
      "http://example.com/my.url"
    ]
  }{% endraw %}
  ```
