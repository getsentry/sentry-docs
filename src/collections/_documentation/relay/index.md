Relay is a proxy application you can set up on-premise in front of Sentry that
allows you to modify or drop events, rate-limit clients or queue events in case
of network failures.  It is supposed to combine some of the benefits of on-premise
hosting (control over data) with the benefits of SaaS (less administrational
effort).
