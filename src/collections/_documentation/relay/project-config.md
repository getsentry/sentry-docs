A Relay will generally not accept or forward events where it doesn't know the project. See [_Getting Started_]({%- link _documentation/relay/quickstart.md -%}) for a short introduction to project configs. This page enumerates all possible options.

The configuration for a project with the ID `123` lives in the file `.semaphore/projects/123.json`. You can get the project ID from the path section of a DSN.

All config keys in a project config are `camelCase`.

{:.config-key}
## disabled

*boolean, default: `false`*

Whether the project is disabled. If set to `true`, the Relay will drop all events sent to this project.

{:.config-key}
## publicKeys

*map from string to boolean, default: `{}`*

A map enumerating known public keys (the public key in a DSN) and whether events using that key should be accepted. Example:

```json
{
    "publicKeys": {
        "___PUBLIC_KEY___": true
    }
}
```

{:.config-key}
## config.allowedDomains

*array of origins (strings), default: `[]`*

Configure origin URLs which Sentry should accept events from.

This is basically the same as the "Allowed Domains" setting in the Sentry UI.

{:.config-key}
## config.piiConfig

See [_PII Configuration_]({%- link _documentation/relay/pii-config/index.md -%}).
