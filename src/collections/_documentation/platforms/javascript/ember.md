To use Sentry with your Ember application, you will need to use Sentryâ€™s browser JavaScript SDK: `@sentry/browser`.
Install it via `npm` or `yarn`:

```bash
# Using yarn
yarn add @sentry/browser


# Using npm
npm install @sentry/browser
```

On its own, `@sentry/browser` will report any uncaught exceptions triggered from your application.

In your Ember app, you can import Sentry via [ESM imports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import).
In order to integrate Sentry with this import method, you can use the Ember addon [ember-auto-import](https://emberobserver.com/addons/ember-auto-import)
If you aren't using `ember-auto-import` in your Ember app yet, install it as follows:

```bash
ember install ember-auto-import
```

Starting with version `5.x` our `Ember` integration lives in its own package `@sentry/integrations`.
Please continue the Sentry integration process by installing the integrations package with `npm` / `yarn` as follows:

```bash
# Using yarn
yarn add @sentry/integrations

# Using npm
npm install @sentry/integrations
```

Then add this to your `app.js`:

```javascript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/browser'
import { Ember as EmberIntegration } from '@sentry/integrations';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
  integrations: [new EmberIntegration()]
});
```

In case you are using the CDN version or the Loader, we provide a standalone file for every integration, you can use it
like this:

```html
<!-- Note that we now also provide a es6 build only -->
<!-- <script src="https://browser.sentry-cdn.com/{% sdk_version sentry.javascript.browser %}/bundle.es6.min.js" integrity="{% sdk_cdn_checksum sentry.javascript.browser latest bundle.es6.min.js %}" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> -->
<script src="https://browser.sentry-cdn.com/{% sdk_version sentry.javascript.browser %}/bundle.min.js" integrity="{% sdk_cdn_checksum sentry.javascript.browser latest bundle.min.js %}" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

<!-- If you include the integration it will be available under Sentry.Integrations.Ember -->
<script src="https://browser.sentry-cdn.com/{% sdk_version sentry.javascript.browser %}/ember.min.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

<script>
  Sentry.init({
    dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
    integrations: [
      new Sentry.Integrations.Ember(),
    ],
  });
</script>
```
