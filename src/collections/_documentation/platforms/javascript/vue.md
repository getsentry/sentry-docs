To use Sentry with your Vue application, you will need to use `@sentry/browser` (Sentry’s browser JavaScript SDK).  
On its own, `@sentry/browser` will report any uncaught exceptions triggered from your application.

Additionally, the Vue _integration_ will capture the name and props state of the active component where the error was thrown. This is reported via Vue’s `config.errorHandler` hook.

Passing in `Vue` is optional, if you do not pass it `window.Vue` has to be present.

Passing in `attachProps` is optional and is `true` if it is not provided. If you set it to `false`, Sentry will suppress sending all Vue components' props for logging.

{% capture __alert %}
Please note that if you enable this integration Vue internally will not call `logError` 
due to a currently know limitation see: [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/8433).  
This means that errors occurring in the Vue renderer will not show up in the developer console.
