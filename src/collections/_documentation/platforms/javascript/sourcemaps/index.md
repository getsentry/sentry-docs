Sentry supports un-minifying JavaScript via source maps. This lets you view source code context obtained from stack traces in their original untransformed form, which is particularly useful for debugging minified code (e.g. UglifyJS), or transpiled code from a higher-level language (e.g. TypeScript, ES6).

## Specify the release

If you are uploading source map artifacts yourself, you must [specify the release]({%- link _documentation/workflow/releases.md -%}) in your SDK.  Sentry will use the release name to associate digested event data with the files youâ€™ve uploaded via the [releases API]({%- link _documentation/api/releases/index.md -%}), [sentry-cli]({%- link _documentation/cli/index.md -%}) or [sentry-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-webpack-plugin). This step is optional if you are hosting source maps on the remote server.
