Sentry has an integration with log4net through the  [Sentry.Log4Net NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sentry.Log4Net).

Without any code change, this package is able to initialize the Sentry SDK and capture events while including additional properties like `Exception` data and more.


## Installation

Using package manager:

```powershell
Install-Package Sentry.Log4Net -Version {% sdk_version sentry.dotnet.log4net %}
```

Or using the .NET Core CLI:

```sh
dotnet add package Sentry.Log4Net -v {% sdk_version sentry.dotnet.log4net %}
```

This package extends `Sentry` main SDK. That means besides the log4net `Appender`, through this package you'll also get access to all API and features available in the main `Sentry` SDK.

## Configuration

Once the log4net integration package is installed in your project, you can modify your configuration file to add the appender.
This can be done, for example, via the `app.config` for console and desktop apps or `web.config` in case of ASP.NET.

```xml
  <appender name="SentryAppender" type="Sentry.Log4Net.SentryAppender, Sentry.Log4Net">
      <Dsn value="___PUBLIC_DSN___"/>
      <!--Sends the log event Identity value as the user-->
      <SendIdentity value="true" />
      <threshold value="INFO" />
    </appender>
```

#### SendIdentity

In the example above, the `SendIdentity` flag was switched on. The SDK then will take the log4net `Identity` value and report to Sentry as the user's id.

#### Dsn

Also in the example above, you can find the [DSN](https://docs.sentry.io/quickstart/#configure-the-dsn) being set. That will instruct the `SentryAppender` to initialize the SDK.

> NOTE:
This is only one of the ways to initialize the SDK. If you wish to configure the SDK programatically, you could **leave the DSN out** from the appender configuration section. The SDK needs to be initialized only **once** and since other integrations (like ASP.NET) are also able to initialize the SDK, you only need to pass the DSN to one of these integrations.
