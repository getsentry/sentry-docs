*Import name: `sentry_sdk.integrations.logging.LoggingIntegration`*

Calling ``sentry_sdk.init()`` already integrates with the logging module. It is
equivalent to this explicit configuration:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.logging import LoggingIntegration

# All of this is already happening by default!
sentry_logging = LoggingIntegration(
    level=logging.INFO,        # Capture info and above as breadcrumbs
    event_level=logging.ERROR  # Send errors as events
)
sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    integrations=[sentry_logging]
)
```

## Usage

```python
import logging
logging.debug("I am a breadcrumb")
logging.error("I am an event", extra=dict(bar=43))
```

* There will be an error event with the message `"I am an event"`.
* `"I am a breadcrumb"` will be attached as breadcrumb to that event.
* `bar` will end up in the event's `extra` attributes.

## Ignoring a logger

Sometimes a logger is extremely noisy and spams you with errors you don't care
about. You can completely ignore that logger by calling `ignore_logger`:

```python
from sentry_sdk.integrations.logging import ignore_logger


ignore_logger("a.spammy.logger")

logger = logging.getLogger("a.spammy.logger")
logger.error("hi")  # no error sent to sentry
```

You can also use `before-send` and `before-breadcrumb` to ignore
only certain messages. See [_Filtering Events_]({%- link
_documentation/error-reporting/configuration/filtering.md -%}) for more information.

## Options

The following keyword arguments can be passed to `LoggingIntegration()`:

* `level` (default `INFO`): Log records with a level higher than or equal to
  `level` will be recorded as breadcrumbs. Any log record with a level lower
  than this one is completely ignored. A value of `None` means that no log
  records will be sent as breadcrumbs.

* `event_level` (default `ERROR`): Log records with a level higher than or equal
  to `event_level` will additionally be reported as event. A value of `None`
  means that no log records will be sent as events.
  
Note that the configured level of each logger will still be honored. That means
that you will not see any `INFO` events from a logger with the level set to `WARNING`,
regardless of how you configure the integration.

## Handler classes

The integration also exports two regular logging `logging.Handler` subclasses
that can be used instead of using `LoggingIntegration`.

**Usually you do not need to use this yourself.** You *can* use this together
with `default_integrations=False` if you want to opt in to what Sentry
captures. The disadvantage is that setting up logging correctly is hard, and
that an opt-in approach to capturing data will miss errors you never would have
thought of looking for in the first place.

See the [API
documentation](https://getsentry.github.io/sentry-python/integrations/logging.m.html#header-classes)
for more information.
