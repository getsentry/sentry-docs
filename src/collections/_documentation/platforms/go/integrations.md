The sentry-go package currently comes with an integration for the native `net/http` package, `echo`, `fasthttp`, `gin`, `iris`, `martini` and `negroni` to make it easy to handle common scenarios.

To see how to use them, navigate to package-specific sections:
- [net/http](/platforms/go/http/)
- [echo](/platforms/go/echo/)
- [fasthttp](/platforms/go/fasthttp/)
- [gin](/platforms/go/gin/)
- [iris](/platforms/go/iris/)
- [martini](/platforms/go/martini/)
- [negroni](/platforms/go/negroni/)
