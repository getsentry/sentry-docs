To report to Sentry you’ll need to use a language-specific SDK. The Sentry team builds and maintains these for most popular languages, but there’s also a large ecosystem supported by the community.

## Sentry-supported SDK's

These SDK's are [maintained](https://github.com/getsentry) and [supported](https://sentry.io/contact/support/) by Sentry staff.

Some platforms have been phased out or have been replaced with new SDKs. For those legacy integrations head over to the [legacy clients]({% link _documentation/clients/index.md %}) page.

## Community-supported SDK's

These SDK's are [maintained and supported](https://forum.sentry.io) by the Sentry community.
