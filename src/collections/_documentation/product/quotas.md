A subscription to Sentry primarily entails a resource quota on the number of events you can send within a window of time. These windows apply to a 60-second bucket for old plans and a one month bucket for new plans. Your subscription will provide a rate limit which is the maximum number of events the server will accept during that period on old plans, and the same can be configured for new plans. The server will respond with a 429 HTTP status code when this threshold has been reached.

Additionally, some plans may also include a daily rate limit. For example, you’ll be restricted to a maximum of 250 events per day if you’re on the Limited plan.

## Increasing Quotas

Each tiered plan in Sentry has a predefined rate limit. The more expensive the plan, the more data you’re allowed to send. While the plans available will fit most individual and small business needs, there often arises a need for more. Fear not, Sentry is designed to handle large throughput, and if your team needs more, we’re happy to help. Reach out to your account manager, or send an email to [support@sentry.io](mailto:support%40sentry.io) to learn more about increasing capacity.

## Rate Limiting Projects {#id1}

If you’re on our Large or Enterprise plan we support per-key rate limits. These allow you to set the maximum volume of events a key will accept during a period of time.

For example, you may have a project in production that generates a lot of noise. With a rate limit you could set the maximum amount of data to “500 events per minute”. Additionally, you could create a second key for the same project for your staging environment which is unlimited, ensuring your QA process is still untouched.

To setup rate limits, navigate to the Project you wish to limit, go to **[Project] » Client Keys**. Select on an individual key or create a new one, and you’ll be able to define a rate limit as well as see a breakdown of events received by that key.

## Inbound Filters {#inbound-data-filters}

In some cases, the data you’re receiving in Sentry is hard to filter, or you simply don’t have the ability to update the SDK’s configuration to apply the filters. Due to this Sentry provides several ways to filter data server-side, which will also apply before any rate limits are checked.

### Built-in Filters

Various built-in filters are available within Sentry. You can find these by going to **[Project] » Project Settings » Inbound Filters**. Each filter caters to specific situations, such as web crawlers or old browsers, and can be enabled as needed by the specific application.

### IP Blocklist

If you have a rogue client, you may find yourself simply wanting to block that IP from sending data. Sentry supports this by going to **[Project] » Project Settings » Inbound Filters** and adding the IP addresses (or subnets) under the **Filter errors from these IP addresses** section.

### Filter by releases

In the case you have a problematic release that is causing an excessive amount of noise, you can ignore all events from that release. Sentry supports this by going to **[Project] » Project Settings » Inbound Filters** and adding the releases under the **Filter errors from these releases** section.

{%- endcapture -%}
{%- include components/alert.html
  title="Note"
  content=__alert_content
%}

### Filter by error message

You can ignore a specific or certain kind of error by going to **[Project] » Project Settings » Inbound Filters** and adding the error message under the **Filter errors by error message** section.

{% capture __alert_content -%}
Filter by error message is available only on Large and Enterprise Plans
{%- endcapture -%}
{%- include components/alert.html

### Filter by issue

If there is an issue that you are unable to take action on but that continues to occur, you can delete and discard it from the issue details page by clicking “delete and discard future events.” This will delete most data associated with an issue and filter out matching events before they ever reach your stream. Matching events will not count towards your quota.

## Spike Protection

Spike protection helps to mitigate the impact of event spikes on your monthly capacity and is available on all plans.

When spike protection is activated, we limit the number of events accepted in any minute to:

`maximum(20, 6 x average events per minute over the last 24 hours)`

**Note:** The 24 hour window ends at the beginning of the current hour, not at the current minute.

What this means is that if you experience a spike, we will temporarily protect you, but if the increase in volume is sustained, the spike protection limit will gradually increase until Sentry finally accepts all events.

### An example

Suppose you start with 0 events. Your spike protection limit is 20/min. At 12am, you start receiving errors at a rate of 4000/hr (or 66/min). From 12am to 1am, Sentry will discard 2800 events and keep only 1200, and send you an email notifying you that spike protection has been activated. Between 1am and 2am, your spike protection limit will still be 20/min because the trailing average for the 24 hours ending 1 am (6 * 4000 / (24 * 60) or roughly 16/min) remains **below** the base spike protection rate of 20/min. Between 2am and 3am, the trailing average is 6 * 8,000 / (24 * 60) or roughly 33/min, so spike protection keeps only 33 of the 66 events sent per minute. By 5 am, the spike protection limit reaches 6 * 16000 / (24 * 60) or 66/min, and all events are accepted.

### How does spike protection help? {#how-does-spike-protection-help}

Because Sentry bills on monthly event volume, spikes can easily consume your Sentry capacity for the rest of the month. If it really is a spike (**large** and **temporary** increase in event volume), spike protection drops the vast majority of events during the spike and conserves your capacity.

### Controlling Volume

It’s important to note that spike protection is not meant to help you **manage your event volume** because it is a moving target. To control event volume, you should use [per-project rate limits](#rate-limiting-projects) or [Inbound Filters](#inbound-data-filters).

## Attributes Limits

Sentry imposes hard limits on various components within an event. While the limits may change over time and vary between attributes most individual attributes are capped at 512 bytes. Additionally, certain attributes also limit the maximum number of items.

For example, `extra` data is limited to 50 items, and each item is capped at 16 KB. Similar restrictions apply to context locals (within a stacktrace’s frame), as well as any similar attributes.

Generic attributes like the event’s label also have limits but are more flexible depending on their case. For example, the message attribute is limited to 1024 bytes.

The following limitations will be automatically enforced:

-   Events greater than 100k are immediately dropped.
-   Stacktraces with large frame counts will be trimmed (the middle frames are dropped).
-   Collections exceeding the max items will be trimmed down to the maximum size.
-   Individual values exceeding the maximum length will be trimmed down to the maximum size.
