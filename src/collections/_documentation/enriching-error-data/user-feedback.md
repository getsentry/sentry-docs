Sentry provides the ability to collect additional feedback from the user upon hitting an error. This is primarily useful in situations where you might generally render a plain error page (the classic `500.html`). To collect the feedback, an embeddable JavaScript widget is available, which can then be shown on demand to your users.

The following pieces of information are requested and collected:

-   The user’s name
-   The user’s email address
-   A description of what happened

When feedback is collected, Sentry will pair it up with the original event giving you additional insights into issues.

## Collecting Feedback

The integration process consists of running our JavaScript SDK (2.1 or newer), authenticating with your public DSN, and passing in the client-side generated Event ID:

{% include components/platform_content.html content_dir='user-feedback-example' %}

If you don't want to use Sentry's native widget, you can also send feedback using our [_User Feedback API_]({%- link _documentation/api/projects/post-project-user-reports.md -%}).

## Customizing the Widget

Several parameters are available to customize the widget, specifically for localization. All options can be passed through the `showReportDialog` call.
