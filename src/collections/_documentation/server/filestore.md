Sentry provides an abstraction called ‘filestore’ which is used for storing files (such as release artifacts).

The default backend stores files on the local disk in `/tmp/sentry-files` which is not suitable for production use.

## File System Backend

```yaml
filestore.backend: 'filesystem'
filestore.options:
  location: '/tmp/sentry-files'
```

In addition to the configuration below, you’ll need to make sure the shell environment has the variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` set.

  bucket_name: '...'
```
