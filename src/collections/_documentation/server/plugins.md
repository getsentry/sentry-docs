There are several interfaces currently available to extend Sentry. These are a work in progress and the API is not frozen.

## Bundled Plugins

Sentry includes several plugins by default. Builtin plugins are controlled via the `INSTALLED_APPS` Django setting:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
  ...
  'sentry.plugins.sentry_mail',
  'sentry.plugins.sentry_urls',
  'sentry.plugins.sentry_useragents',
]
```

`sentry.plugins.sentry_urls`

: Enables auto tagging of urls based on the Http interface contents.

`sentry.plugins.sentry_mail`

: Enables email notifications when new events or regressions happen.

`sentry.plugins.sentry_useragents`

: Enables auto tagging of browsers and operating systems based on the `User-Agent` header in the HTTP interface.
