title: Moving on Up - Migrating Sentry to Cloud
sidebar_order: 6
---

Sentry has both an open-source and a hosted cloud solution that are functionally the same. Despite open-source being a core value for us at Sentry, we donâ€™t necessarily recommend it for everyone. As Sentry evolves, many customers are finding out that it can quickly become expensive to maintain, scale, and support, making our SaaS product, the better and less costly option. For more information take a look at our post on [Self Hosted or Cloud Sentry?](https://sentry.io/_/resources/about-sentry/self-hosted-vs-cloud/)
