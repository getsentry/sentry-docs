## Enable Single Sign-On Access

SAML2 Single Sign-On (SSO) enables your team to log in quickly, streamlines the on-boarding/off-boarding process for member accounts, and strengthens your login with secure credentials. Sentry provides out of the box configuration for integrating SSO providers like **Okta**, **OneLogin**, **AuthO** and others, in addition to a generic configuration option for any other **SAML2 Identity Provider**.

![SSO Providers]({% asset guides/getting-started/02.png @path %})

We recommend setting up SAML2/SSO immediately so that new members can easily join your organization. Set-up only takes a few steps and can be completed by any user with the **Owner** or **Manager** role. Once enabled, Sentry will automatically send pre-existing members an email with instructions on linking their account.
