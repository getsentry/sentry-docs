This step-by-step guide walks you through the flow of setting up and configuring your Sentry account to monitor errors in a frontend application. After completing this guide, your Sentry account will:

- Notify you when errors happen in your code
- Display a readable stack trace with source code context in the stack frame for debugging
- Suggest suspected commits and suitable developers to quickly resolve issues

> **Note:**  We provided the source code for a sample React application to use along with this guide. This allows us to streamline the steps required to getting the maximum value out of integrating Sentry into your development workflow.
>
> Alternatively, you can follow this guide as a reference and apply the relevant changes directly to your source code.
