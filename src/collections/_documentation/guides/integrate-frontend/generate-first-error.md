Now that the Demo App is up and running on your local environment integrated with the Sentry SDK, you're ready to generate the first error.

> **Note:** If you're not using the provided React demo code, follow [Capturing your first event]({%- link _documentation/error-reporting/quickstart.md -%}) to introduce an error to your source code and continue with [Step 2](#step-2-handle-the-error)

## Step 1: Capture your first event

1. Launch the demo app by opening the [localhost link](http://localhost:5000) in your browser

2. Open the browser's **Console** to verify that an error has occurred

    ![Import and Configure SDK]({% asset guides/integrate-frontend/generate-first-error-02.png @path %})

3. Click on any of the **Buy!** buttons to add products to your shopping cart

4. Click on the **Checkout** button on the left panel to generate an error

    ![Import and Configure SDK]({% asset guides/integrate-frontend/generate-first-error-01.png @path %})

    Notice that:
    * An error message **Something went wrong** displays in the app
    * The error appears in the browser console
    * An alert sent to your email address configured on Sentry.io notifying you about an error that occurred in your app

        ![Import and Configure SDK]({% asset guides/integrate-frontend/generate-first-error-03.png @path %})

## Step 2: Handle the error

1. Go to your email inbox and open the email notification from Sentry

    ![Import and Configure SDK]({% asset guides/integrate-frontend/generate-first-error-04.png @path %})

2. Click on `View on Sentry` to view the full details and context of this error in your Sentry account

    ![Import and Configure SDK]({% asset guides/integrate-frontend/generate-first-error-05.png @path %})
    > **Note:** Sentry aggregates similar errors (events) into one Issue

3. Scroll down to the `Exception` stack trace

    ![Error Stack-trace]({% asset guides/integrate-frontend/generate-first-error-06.png @path %})

    > * Notice that the stack trace is **minified**.  JavaScript is typically minified to reduce to the size of the source code.
    > * Sentry can un-minify the code back to its readable form and display source (code) context lines in each stack frame, which is covered in the next section.
