This step-by-step guide walks you through the flow of setting up and configuring your Sentry account to monitor errors in your `Python` backend application. After completing this guide, you should:

- Add basic configurations
- Send handled and unhandled issues to Sentry
- Implement tracing between your frontend and backend app

> **Note:** We provided the source code for a sample `Django` application to use along with this guide. This allows us to streamline the steps required to getting the maximum value out of integrating Sentry into your development workflow.
>
> Alternatively, you can follow this guide as a reference and apply the relevant changes directly to your source code.

## Prerequisites

- A [Sentry](https://sentry.io) account, or [sign up](https://sentry.io/signup/) for one
