You can configure various notifications from your [personal notifications](https://sentry.io/settings/account/notifications/) settings. 

### Project Alerts

These notifications are triggered based on the alert rules configured within a project. Read more about alerts [here]({%- link _documentation/workflow/notifications/alerts.md -%}). 

> [{% asset project-alerts.png %}]({% asset project-alerts.png @path %})

These can be toggled on or off for all projects, or you can click "Fine tune alerts by project" to configure this with more granularity. 

> [{% asset alerts-configuration.png %}]({% asset alerts-configuration.png @path %})

"Default" in this case means that it will follow the overall project alerts switch.

### Workflow Notifications 

These notifications are triggered based on issue activity. Read more about workflow notifications [here]({%- link _documentation/workflow/notifications/workflow.md -%}). 

> [{% asset workflow-alerts.png %}]({% asset workflow-alerts.png @path %})

These can be set for all projects, or you can click "Fine tune workflow notifications by project" to configure this with more granularity.

> [{% asset workflow-configuration.png %}]({% asset workflow-configuration.png @path %})

Again, "Default" in this case means that it will follow the overall workflow notifications switch.

### Issue Notifications

To opt out of a specific issue's notifications, click "unsubscribe" at the bottom right of the issue's page.
