Most activity within Sentry will generate a workflow notification. Core workflow notifications include:

-   Assignment
-   Comments
-   Regressions â€“ when Sentry changes state of an issue from **resolved** to **unresolved**

By default, these notifications are sent to anyone who is a member of the project the issue occurs in, but each member may choose their participation state, as well as opt in or opt out of notifications for specific issues (in the "Notifications" section at the bottom right of the issue detail view). 

Read about [notification management]({%- link _documentation/workflow/notifications/notification-management.md -%}) for more information.
