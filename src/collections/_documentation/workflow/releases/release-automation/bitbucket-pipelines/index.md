The [Sentry Release Pipe](https://bitbucket.org/sentryio/sentry-new-release) automates Sentry release management in Bitbucket Pipelines with just one step. After sending Sentry release information, you'll be able to identify suspect commits that are likely the culprit for new errors. You'll also be able to apply source maps to see the original code in Sentry.

For more details about Sentry release management concepts, see the full documenation on [releases]({%- link _documentation/workflow/releases/index.md -%}).
