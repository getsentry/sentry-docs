The [Sentry Netlify build plugin](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-netlify-build-plugin) automates Sentry release management in Netlify with just one step. After sending Sentry release information, you'll be able to identify suspect commits that are likely the culprit for new errors. You'll also be able to apply source maps to see the original code in Sentry.

For more details about Sentry release management concepts, see the full documentation on [releases]({%- link _documentation/workflow/releases/index.md -%}).
