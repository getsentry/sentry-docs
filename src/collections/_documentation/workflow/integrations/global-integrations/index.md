These integrations are set up once per organization, and are then usable in all projects.

#### Issue Management

Issue tracking allows you to create issues from within Sentry, and link Sentry issues to existing supported integration Issues.

Once you’ve navigated to a specific issue, you’ll find the **Linked Issues** section on the right hand panel. Here, you’ll be able to create or link issues.

#### Issue Notifications

Alert notifications in Sentry can be routed to many supported integrations, but by default are aimed at email. You will need to configure a project’s [**Alert Rules**]({%- link _documentation/workflow/notifications/alerts.md -%}) to properly route notifications to a specific integration.
