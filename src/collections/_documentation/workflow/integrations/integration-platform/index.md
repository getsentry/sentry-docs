Sentry's Integration Platform provides a way for external services to interact with the Sentry SaaS service using the REST API and webhooks. Integrations utilizing this platform are first class actors within Sentry and begin in an unpublished state where the app is available for use in your organization. 

For differences between an Integration Platform Application and prior methods of integrating with Sentry, see the FAQ at the bottom of the page.

## Configuration

The examples below demonstrate a potential use-case that involves a Flask app receiving new issue webhooks from Sentry, calling the Sentry API for more data about the issue, and pushing it to [Pushover](https://pushover.net/) as a generator of desktop/mobile notifications. 

### Creating an Integration

In Sentry, navigate to Organization Settings > Developer Settings > Create New Integration.

[{% asset integration-platform-index/create-new-integration.png alt="Form that allows user to fill in their integration details." %}]({% asset integration-platform-index/create-new-integration.png @path %})

### Permissions

Permissions specify what level of access your service requires of Sentry resources. Sentry will prompt your user to approve of these permissions upon installation. For more information on Permissions, [see full documentation]({%- link _documentation/api/permissions.md -%}).

[{% asset integration-platform-index/permissions.png alt="Form that allows developer to set what permissions they'll need from their user." %}]({% asset integration-platform-index/permissions.png @path %})

### Resource Subscriptions

Selecting a resource subscription determines the types of webhook requests sent to your service. Currently you can get requests for issues when they are created, assigned, ignored, or resolved. 

[{% asset integration-platform-index/resource-subscription.png alt="Screenshot of what the resource subscription looks like." %}]({% asset integration-platform-index/resource-subscription.png @path %})

## Building the Integration

After installation, if your user has approved of all permissions, Sentry will generate a grant code and an installation ID. If your integration has a Redirect URL configured, the integration redirects the user's browser to the configured URL with the grant code and installation ID in the query params.

Start your build by implementing the Redirect URL endpoint, `/setup` — typically where you exchange the grant code for an access token that allows you to make API calls to Sentry. 

```python
import requests
from flask import redirect, request

@app.route('/setup', methods=['GET'])
def setup():
    code = request.args.get('code')
    install_id = request.args.get('installationId')
    
    url = u'http://sentry.io/api/0/sentry-app-installations/{}/authorizations/'
    url = url.format(install_id)
    
    payload = {
        'grant_type': 'authorization_code',
        'code': code,
        'client_id': 'your-client-id',
        'client_secret': 'your-client-secret',
    }
    
    resp = requests.post(url, json=payload)
    data = resp.json()
    
    access_token = data['token']
    refresh_token = data['refreshToken']
    # ... Securely store the install_id, access_token and refresh_token in DB ...
    
    return redirect('http://sentry.io/settings/')
```

Next, implement the Webhook URL endpoint, `/webhook`, which receives requests based on your resource subscriptions. In this case that includes when an issue is created. In this method, you'll use the Sentry API to check if the issue belongs to a project called Backend, and if it does, you'll forward the issue to Pushover.

```python
@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def webhook():
    data = json.loads(request.data)
    
    if data['action'] != 'created':
        return
    
    issue_id = data['data']['issue']['id']
    install_id = data['installation']['uuid']
    
    issue_details = get_sentry_issue(install_id, issue_id)
    
    if issue_details['project']['name'] != 'Backend':
        return
        
    event = data['data']['event']
    
    payload = {
        'user': 'pushover-user-key',
        'token': 'pushover-api-token',
        'message': event['message'][:1024],
        'title': event['message'][:250],
        'url': event['url'],
        'url_title': 'Issue Details',
        'priority': 0,
    }
    requests.post('https://api.pushover.net/1/messages.json', data=payload)

def get_sentry_issue(install_id, issue_id):
    access_token = retrieve_from_db(install_id)
    
    url = 'https://sentry.io/api/0/issues/{}/'.format(issue_id)
    headers = {'Authorization': 'Bearer {}'.format(access_token)}
    
    resp = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    return resp.json()
```

## Refreshing Access Tokens

The Access Tokens you receive from Sentry expire after eight hours. To retrieve a new token, you'll make a request to the same Authorization endpoint as above, but with a slightly different request body.

```python
def refresh_token(install_id):
    url = u'http://sentry.io/api/0/sentry-app-installations/{}/authorizations/'
    url = url.format(install_id)
    
    refresh_token = retrieve_refresh_token_from_db(install_id)
    
    payload = {
        'grant_type': 'refresh_token',
        'refresh_token': refresh_token,
        'client_id': 'your-client-id',
        'client_secret': 'your-client-secret',
    }
    
    resp = requests.post(url, json=payload)
    data = resp.json()
    
    new_access_token = data['token']
    new_refresh_token = data['refreshToken']
    # ... Securely update the access_token and refresh_token in DB...
    
    return new_access_token
```

Instead of keeping track of times and passively refreshing at the time a token expires, one painless way you can handle refreshing tokens is to actively capture exceptions raised by requests that receive a `401 Unauthorized` response from Sentry, refresh the token, and remake the request. 

You can modify your `get_sentry_issue` function to do this:

```python
def get_sentry_issue(install_id, issue_id):
    access_token = retrieve_from_db(install_id)
    
    url = 'https://sentry.io/api/0/issues/{}/'.format(issue_id)
    headers = {'Authorization': 'Bearer {}'.format(access_token)}
    
    resp = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    
    if resp.status_code == 401:
        new_access_token = refresh_token(install_id)
        headers['Authorization'] = u'Bearer {}'.format(new_access_token)
        resp = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
        
    return resp.json()
```

From here you can augment your `/webhook` endpoint to handle other events in the future, make requests to Sentry from elsewhere in your app, and implement the integrated features your customers most desire.

## UI Components

The Sentry Integration Platform provides the ability to add rich UI components to Sentry itself through a declarative syntax that requires zero code. 

Through a JSON-Schema based system, you can have Sentry render a way for Users to link Sentry Issues to Issues in your service or open a specific line of a stack trace in your tool. We'll be expanding the scope of what you can augment over time, as well.

```json
{
    "elements": [{
        "type": "stacktrace-link",
        "uri": "/debug",
    }]
}
```

## FAQ

#### How are Sentry Integrations different from Plugins?

Plugins (aka Legacy Integrations) are extensions of Sentry packaged as Python libraries. Plugins have been contributed both internally (for example, sentry-plugins) and externally by outside developers (for example, sentry-trello). Plugins are configured separately for each project.

#### How is the Sentry Integration different from OAuth Apps?

OAuth Applications allow an external developer to create an application which can authenticate as a Sentry user and take actions as the user within Sentry.

Sentry Integration apps are similar to OAuth apps, except Sentry Integration apps act as an independent entity. There is currently no way for Sentry Integration apps to act on behalf of a user.

#### How is the Sentry Integration different from Auth Tokens?

Auth tokens are personal access tokens a user can use to invoke APIs directly. Sentry Integration Apps do not represent a single user, but rather make requests as “itself."

#### We use the Sentry API internally at our company. Should we switch to the Sentry Integration Platform?

If you're looking for any of the new features below, we recommend you switch to the Sentry Integration Platform.

**Permissions**

OAuth apps and Auth Tokens allow you to access Sentry as a specific user in your Sentry org. This means:

- If this user leaves the org or their permissions change, the integration can break. A Sentry Integrations App, on the other hand, is a separate, independent entity with its own permissions.
- OAuth apps and Auth Tokens permit the user to access other Sentry organizations they belong to, so there is limited isolation.
- Actions taken in Sentry will connect to this user rather than the integration/app. For example, if your alerting integration automatically assigns issues to a teammate, it will appear in the history as “Alice assigned Bob issue XYZ” rather than “<Your Sentry Integration apps> assigned Bob issue XYZ.”

**Managing Subscriptions**

With Sentry Integration apps you can manage resource subscriptions in the UI, as opposed to the current state where you need to make API calls to create/update/delete/retrieve subscriptions. The latter is not only more cumbersome but also harder to keep track of and maintain visibility across your team.

**Scope**

Currently, resource subscriptions must be configured per-project, which is unnecessary overhead especially when adding/removing projects. With Sentry Integration apps, you’ll receive notifications for all projects in your organization.

**New Event Types**

Sentry Integration apps expose a richer set of events that are not available via the legacy service hooks API. Currently, this includes Issue Created, Issue Resolved, Issue Ignored, and Issue Assigned. In the future, we’ll add more types of webhooks to Sentry Integration apps.

**Custom UI Components**

Sentry Integration apps will be able to augment Sentry’s UI in meaningful and feature-rich ways. For example, on the issue page, you could have a button that creates a task in your task-management tool, or open a line in the stack trace in another tool.
