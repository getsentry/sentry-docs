These integrations are set up once per organization, and are then usable in all projects.

## Issue Management

Issue tracking allows you to create issues from within Sentry, and link Sentry issues to existing supported integration Issues.

Once you’ve navigated to a specific issue, you’ll find the **Linked Issues** section on the right hand panel. Here, you’ll be able to create or link issues.

### Azure DevOps
You can now use the data from your commits to Azure DevOps, formerly known as Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS), to help you find and fix bugs faster.

#### Configure Azure DevOps

{% capture __alert_content -%}
Sentry owner or manager permissions, and Azure project admin permissions are required to install this integration.
{%- endcapture -%}
{%- include components/alert.html
  title="Note"
  content=__alert_content
  level="warning"
%}

1. In Sentry, navigate to Organization Settings > **Integrations**.
2. If you have the legacy VSTS integration installed, you’ll see a button next to Azure DevOps that says **Upgrade**. If you do not have the legacy VSTS integration installed, you’ll see a button that says **Install**.

    [{% asset azure-global-install.png %}]({% asset azure-global-install.png @path %})

3. In the resulting modal, click **Add Installation**.

    [{% asset azure-global-add-installation.png %}]({% asset azure-global-add-installation.png @path %})
    
4. An Azure DevOps install window should pop up. Select the Azure DevOps account you'd like to link with Sentry, and press **Submit**.

    [{% asset azure-global-installed.png %}]({% asset azure-global-installed.png @path %})  
Azure DevOps should now be enabled for all projects under your Sentry organization, but you'll need to configure the features below.

#### Commit Tracking

Commit tracking allows you to hone in on problematic commits. Learn more about [commit tracking]({%- link _documentation/workflow/releases/index.md -%}#link-repository).

#### Suspect Commits and Suggested Assignees

Once you set up commit tracking, you’ll be able to see the most recent changes to files found in the issue’s stack trace with suspect commits.

For issues where the files in the stack trace match files included in commits sent to Sentry, you’ll see the suspect commit, with a link to the commit itself.

[{% asset azure-global-suspect-commit.png %}]({% asset azure-global-suspect-commit.png @path %})  

You’ll also see that the author of the suspect commit will be listed as a suggested assignee for this issue. To assign the issue to the suggested assignee, click on their icon.

#### Issue Management

Issue tracking allows you to create Azure DevOps issues from within Sentry, and link Sentry issues to existing Azure DevOps Issues.

{% capture __alert_content -%}
Issue management is available for organizations on the Team, Business, and Enterprise plans.
{%- endcapture -%}
{%- include components/alert.html
  title="Note"
  content=__alert_content
  level="warning"
%}

Once you’ve navigated to a specific issue, you’ll find the **Linked Issues** section on the right hand panel. Here, you’ll be able to create or link Azure DevOps issues.

[{% asset azure-global-link-issue.png %}]({% asset azure-global-link-issue.png @path %})

#### Issue Sync

Sync comments, assignees and status updates for issues in Sentry to Azure DevOps, to minimize duplication. When you delegate an issue to an assignee or update a status on Azure DevOps, the updates will also populate in Sentry. When you resolve an issue in Sentry, it will automatically update in Azure DevOps.

{% capture __alert_content -%}
Issue sync is available for organizations on the Team, Business, and Enterprise plans.
{%- endcapture -%}
{%- include components/alert.html
  title="Note"
  content=__alert_content
  level="warning"
%}

To configure Issue sync, navigate to Organization Settings > **Integrations**, and click **Configure** next to your Azure DevOps instance. On the following page, you’ll see options of what information you’d like synced between Sentry and Azure DevOps.

[{% asset azure-global-issue-sync.png %}]({% asset azure-global-issue-sync.png @path %})

#### Resolve in Commit

Once you send commit data, you can start resolving issues by including `fixes <SENTRY-SHORT-ID>` in your commit messages. For example, a commit message might look like:

```
Prevent empty queries on users

Fixes MYAPP-317
```

When Sentry sees this, we’ll automatically annotate the matching issue with reference to the commit, and later, when that commit is part of a release, we’ll mark the issue as resolved.

#### Troubleshooting

###### No accounts during installation

[{% asset azure-add-account-no-accounts.png %}]({% asset azure-add-account-no-accounts.png @path %})  

If you reach the account selection page during the Azure Devops installation process (step 4 in the instructions above) and see that there are no accounts available to select, please check the following possibilities:

- Ensure you are logged into the account connected to your Azure DevOps organization.
- Double-check that your account is a Microsoft Account (MSA). At this time, we do not support Azure Active Directory (AAD) accounts.

        [{% asset gitlab/gitlab-app-id.png alt="GitLab application id and secret" %}]({% asset gitlab/gitlab-app-id.png @path %})

    1. Use this information to fill out the GitLab Configuration and click **Submit**.
    
        [{% asset gitlab/gitlab-configuration.png alt="GitLab configuration form" %}]({% asset gitlab/gitlab-configuration.png @path %})

1. In the resulting panel, click **Authorize**.

1. In Sentry, return to Organization Settings > **Integrations**. You’ll see a new instance of GitLab underneath the list of integrations.

1. Next to your GitLab Instance, click **Configure**. _It’s important to configure to receive the full benefits of commit tracking._

    [{% asset gitlab/configure-button.png alt="GitLab instance with connected group and highlighted configure button" %}]({% asset gitlab/configure-button.png @path %})

1. On the resulting page, click **Add Repository** to select which repositories in which you’d like to begin tracking commits.

    [{% asset gitlab/add-repo.png alt="Add repository" %}]({% asset gitlab/add-repo.png @path %})

#### Issue Management
Issue tracking allows you to create GitLab issues from within Sentry and link Sentry issues to existing GitLab issues.

1. Select your issue

    [{% asset gitlab/sentry-unresolved-issues.png alt="List of unresolved issues" %}]({% asset gitlab/sentry-unresolved-issues.png @path %})

1. Navigate to Linked Issues on the right panel of the issue's page and click **Link GitLab Issue**.
    
    [{% asset gitlab/link-gitlab-issue.png alt="GitLab logo with Link GitLab Issue text" %}]({% asset gitlab/link-gitlab-issue.png @path %}) 

1. You have two options to complete the issue link:

    1. In the pop-up, you can fill out the appropriate details in the _Create_ tab, and then click **Create Issue**.
    
        [{% asset gitlab/gitlab-create-issue.png alt="pop-up modal to create issue" %}]({% asset gitlab/gitlab-create-issue.png @path %})
    
    1. Or, in the pop-up, you can click the _Link_ tab, search the issue by name, and then click **Link Issue**. _Issues aren't currently searchable by number._
    
        [{% asset gitlab/link-issue-by-name.png alt="pop-up modal to search issue name" %}]({% asset gitlab/link-issue-by-name.png @path %})

1. To unlink an issue, click on the **X** next to its name under Linked Issues.

    [{% asset gitlab/unlink-issue.png alt="GitLab logo and project next to an X icon" %}]({% asset gitlab/unlink-issue.png @path %})
    
#### Commit Tracking

Commit tracking allows you to hone in on problematic commits. With commit tracking, you can better isolate what might be problematic by leveraging information from releases like tags and metadata.

Once you've configured both [release and commit tracking]({%- link _documentation/workflow/releases/index.md -%}), you'll be able to see more thorough information about a release: who made commits, which issues were newly introduced by this release, and which deploys were impacted.

[{% asset gitlab/last-commit-in-releases.png alt="Dashboard with last commit highlighted" %}]({% asset gitlab/last-commit-in-releases.png @path %})

When you investigate deeper into that commit, you can leverage information from metadata like tags.

[{% asset gitlab/highlighting-tags.png alt="Issue detail highlighting tags" %}]({% asset gitlab/highlighting-tags.png @path %})

Broadly, this lets you isolate problems in order to see which commits might be problematic.

Learn more about [release and commit tracking]({%- link _documentation/workflow/releases/index.md -%}).

#### Suspect Commit

Once you are tracking the commits, the 'suspect commit' is the commit that likely introduced the error.

One special benefit of using Sentry's Commit Tracking is the ability to know the suspect commit that likely caused the error, with a suggested plan of action for how to rectify the error. For example, after pinpointing the suspect commit, you can also identify the developer who made the commit and assign them the task of fixing the error. 

[{% asset gitlab/highlighting-suspect-commits.png alt="Issue detail highlighting suspect commits" %}]({% asset gitlab/highlighting-suspect-commits.png @path %})

Here is where you can find info for [suspect commit setup]({%- link _documentation/workflow/releases/index.md -%}#link-repository).

#### Resolve via Commit or PR

Once you've added a repository (see configuration step 8), you can start resolving issues by including `fixes <SHORT-ID>` in your commit messages. You might want to type something in the commit like: "this fixes MyApp-AB12" or "Fixes MyApp-317". The keyword to include is **fixes**. You can also resolve issues with pull requests by including `fixes <SHORT-ID>` in the title or description. This will automatically resolve the issue in the next release. 

A `<SHORT-ID>` may look something like 'BACKEND-C' in the image below.

[{% asset gitlab/short-id.png alt="Issue detail highlighting suspect commits" %}]({% asset gitlab/short-id.png @path %})

#### Troubleshooting

FAQ:
- I'm using GitLab on-premise. Do I need to whitelist Sentry's IP addresses?
    - Yes. You can find our IP ranges [ here ]({%- link ip-ranges.md -%}).
- Do you support subgroups?
    - Currently, we only support subgroups for users using GitLab 11.6 or higher.
- My repositories are hosted under my user account, not a group account. Can I still use this integration?
    - Unfortunately, not. The GitLab integration only works for repositories that are hosted under group accounts.
- Are there pricing restrictions?
    - This integration is available for organizations on the [Team, Business, or Enterprise plan](https://sentry.io/pricing/).
- Who has permission to install this?
    - You must have both owner/manager permissions in Sentry and owner permissions in GitLab to successfully install this integration.

### Slack

The global Slack integration creates workflows for your team. Now you can triage, resolve, and ignore Sentry issues directly from Slack.

#### Configure Slack

{% capture __alert_content -%}
Sentry owner or manager permissions are required to install this integration. Slack defaults to let any workspace member authorize apps, but they may have to request access. See this [Slack help article](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202035138-Add-an-app-to-your-workspace) for more details.

{%- endcapture -%}
{%- include components/alert.html
    title="Note"
    content=__alert_content
    level="warning"
%}

1. In Sentry, navigate to Organization Settings > **Integrations**.

1. At the top of the page, you’ll see the available Global Integrations list, which includes Slack. Click **Install** to integrate Sentry with your Slack workspace(s).

    [{% asset slack-all-integrations-page.png %}]({% asset slack-all-integrations-page.png @path %})

1. Click **Add workspace**.

    [{% asset slack-auth-choose-workspace.png %}]({% asset slack-auth-choose-workspace.png @path %})

    You can toggle the Slack workspace you want to connect in the dropdown menu in the upper right corner of the authentication window. To set up multiple workspaces, go through this process for each separate workspace.

1. After you've connected to the correct workspace, click **Continue**.

1. On the next page, you can choose the scope of channels you’d like Sentry to access. You can specify all public channels or choose specific channels. Then click **Install**.

    [{% asset slack-auth-channel-pref.png %}]({% asset slack-auth-channel-pref.png @path %})

1. Your Organization Integrations page will refresh and show the Slack workspace you just added.

    [{% asset slack-add-workspace-success.png %}]({% asset slack-add-workspace-success.png @path %})

    You’ll also see the Sentry app join the Slack channels you specified right away.

    [{% asset slack-sentry-integration-in-channel.png %}]({% asset slack-sentry-integration-in-channel.png @path %})

Now your Slack integration is available to all projects in your Sentry organization. See the next section to configure your notification settings.

#### Configure Alert Rules

1. Confirm your Slack workspace is configured globally for your Sentry organization by navigating to Organization Settings > **Integrations**.

    [{% asset slack-add-workspace-success.png %}]({% asset slack-add-workspace-success.png @path %})

1. Click **Configure** and you’ll see the available Slack workspaces for your project. From this page, you can click on **Add Alert Rule** for this project to go directly to your Alert Rule settings.

    [{% asset slack-global-integration-project-settings-add-alert.png %}]({% asset slack-global-integration-project-settings-add-alert.png @path %})

    You can also access **Alerts** from your **Project Settings**. From here, you can configure when notifications are sent to your Slack workspace(s).

    You can route notifications in a few ways: to a specific channel in your Slack workspace, to multiple channels in your Slack workspace, or to multiple Slack workspaces.

1. Click **New Alert Rule** to configure a new Alert.

    [{% asset slack-alert-rules.png %}]({% asset slack-alert-rules.png @path %})

    For any existing Alert Rules, you can edit the rule to update the Slack channel routing. When you click **Edit Rule**, under **Take these actions** you can specify your Slack channel(s):

    [{% asset slack-alert-rule-edit.png %}]({% asset slack-alert-rule-edit.png @path %})

    After selecting **Send a notification to the {workspace} Slack workspace to {channel} and include tags {tags}**, you can specify the workspace, channel(s), and tags you’d like to include with your Alert Rule.

    [{% asset slack-alert-rule-for-one-workspace.png %}]({% asset slack-alert-rule-for-one-workspace.png @path %})

    You can add Alert Rules routing to as many Slack channels as you’d like.

1. Then once you receive a Slack notification, you can use the Resolve, Ignore, or Assign buttons to update the Issue in Sentry.

    [{% asset slack-alert-message.png %}]({% asset slack-alert-message.png @path %})

#### Deleting the legacy Slack integration

Once you configure the global Slack integration and Alert Rules, you can disable the old Slack integration. You’ll need to go to each project that has it enabled and disable it. We recommend disabling the legacy integration after setting up the global integration.

## Incident Management

These integrations will connect your Sentry to incident management platforms to increase your visibility into incidents.

### PagerDuty
The global PagerDuty integration allows you to connect your Sentry organization with one or more PagerDuty accounts, and start getting incidents triggered from Sentry alerts.

1. In Sentry, navigate to **Organization Settings** > **Integrations**

2. Find PagerDuty in the list of the available Global Integrations list and click **Install.**
    
    [{% asset pagerduty/pd_not_installed.png %}]({% asset pagerduty/pd_not_installed.png @path %})

3. Click **Add Installation.**

    [{% asset pagerduty/pd_learn_more.png %}]({% asset pagerduty/pd_learn_more.png @path %})

4. You'll then be redirected to sign into PagerDuty and choose the account you'd like to connect to the current Sentry organization you are in.

    [{% asset pagerduty/pd_account_picker.png %}]({% asset pagerduty/pd_account_picker.png @path %})

5. After picking the account, you'll be prompted to add the PagerDuty services you want Sentry to send incidents to. Click **Connect** once you've added your services.  

    [{% asset pagerduty/pd_add_services.png %}]({% asset pagerduty/pd_add_services.png @path %})

6. The PagerDuty integration should now be installed. You'll be able to see the services connected by going to the **configure** page for your installation. 

    [{% asset pagerduty/pd_installed.png %}]({% asset pagerduty/pd_installed.png @path %})

7. You can now set up rules to use the new integration under **Project Configuration** in the configure section of your installation. 

    [{% asset pagerduty/pd_org_configuration.png %}]({% asset pagerduty/pd_org_configuration.png @path %})

If you re-generate an integration key for one of your services in PagerDuty you can manually update that value in configuration page for your PagerDuty installation. Additionally, you can add services by clicking the **Add Services** button in the top right. This will take you to the same page, as shown in step 5. 

8. Click **Add Alert Rule** in the integration configuration page or go to the **Project Settings** > **Alerts** to set up a **New Alert Rule** for the PagerDuty Integration.

    [{% asset pagerduty/pd_alert_rule.png %}]({% asset pagerduty/pd_alert_rule.png @path %})
    

#### Deleting the legacy PagerDuty integration

Once you configure the global PagerDuty integration and Alert Rules, you can disable the old PagerDuty integration. You’ll need to go to each project that has it enabled and disable it. We recommend disabling the legacy integration after setting up the global integration.

### Amixr

In Amixr, issues from Sentry get stored as well as alerts from other sources like Grafana or Alertmanager. The Amixr integration synchronizes issue statuses between Amixr and Sentry. Issues get posted to your Slack, and users can change the statuses of those issues by clicking on buttons within the message.

{% include components/alert.html
  title="Note"
  content="This integration **won't** work with self-hosted Sentry."
  level="warning"
%}

#### Install and Configure Amixr

Follow the instructions in the link below:  
<https://docs.amixr.io/#/integrations/sentry>

## Code Linking

These integrations will allow seamlessly connect a Sentry error to the underlying code behind the error in a separate platform.

### Rookout

Rookout's new integration adds a layer of depth to Sentry Issues by allowing you to jump right from an Issue to a non-breaking breakpoint on the line that caused the error. 

{% include components/alert.html
  title="Note"
  content="This integration **won't** work with self-hosted Sentry."
  level="warning"
%}

#### Installation

1. In Sentry, navigate to Organization Settings > **Integrations**.
2. Find the Rookout Integration and click **Install**.

    [{% asset rookout/rookout_install.png alt="Sentry's integrations page with Rookout at the top." %}]({% asset rookout/rookout_install.png @path %})

3. In the resulting modal, approve the permissions by clicking **Install**.

    [{% asset rookout/rookout_modal.png alt="Sentry modal indicating that permissions need installation." %}]({% asset rookout/rookout_modal.png @path %})

4. Your Rookout Integration is ready to use!

#### Use Integration in Stack Trace

After installing Rookout in Sentry, you can go straight to the line of code in your stack trace, and click the Rookout icon. That will take you directly to the same line of code in the same file inside Rookout.

1. In Sentry, navigate to the specific **Issue** you want to link and navigate to the **Stack Trace**.
2. In the Stack Trace, you'll see the option to open the line in Rookout by clicking on the Rookout icon.

    [{% asset rookout/rookout_line_in_stack_trace.png alt="Sentry stack trace showing the Rookout icon on a specific line." %}]({% asset rookout/rookout_line_in_stack_trace.png @path %})

3. Clicking on the Rookout icon takes you to Rookout's web UI where you can continue the debugging process. Rookout makes the best guess for the corresponding project and file in its web UI and will take you to the correct line of code in the file.

    [{% asset rookout/rookout_screen_1.png alt="Sentry modal indicating that permissions need installation." %}]({% asset rookout/rookout_screen_1.png @path %})


## A/B Testing

These integrations will connect your Sentry to A/B testing platforms to give you better insight when users in one of your test groups are encountering errors.

### Split

The Split integration quickly processes and displays Sentry exception data in the Split platform as track events for analysis. You can control what environments and traffic types you're capturing exceptions for in the Split dashboard without having to touch any code.

The Split integration is only available for organizations on the Business and Enterprise plans.

{% include components/alert.html
  title="Note"
  content="This integration **won't** work with self-hosted Sentry."
  level="warning"
%}

#### Install and Configure Split

Follow the instructions in the link below:  
<https://help.split.io/hc/en-us/articles/360029879431>

## Troubleshooting
If you're having trouble setting up Sentry with your on-premise integration like JIRA Server, Bitbucket Server, GitHub Enterprise, or Gitlab:
- Ensure that the installation URL you provided is a fully qualified domain name (FQDN), which is resolvable on the internet.
- Double-check that the IP addresses Sentry uses to make outbound requests are whitelisted <https://docs.sentry.io/ip-ranges/>.
- Make sure that Sentry's access to your installation URL is not path restricted.
