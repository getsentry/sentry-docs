Dashboards are various data visualizations of your errors across your organization --- including graphs of your errors, geographic mapping, and lists of browsers. Dashboards allow you to drill into data by selecting points of interest.

### Overall View of Application
Each graph and visualization helps uncover crucial patterns and trends about where your customers are hitting errors.
