Search in Sentry currently exists in a limited fashion. You can perform basic CONTAINS matches on the title of an issue or exact matches on tags.

Queries are constructed using a `token:value` pattern:

```
is:resolved user.username:"Jane Doe" server:web-8 example error
```

In the above there are four tokens:

-   `is:resolved`
-   `user.username:Jane Doe`
-   `server:web-8`
-   `example error`

The first two are standard search tokens, both using reserved keywords. The third is pointing to a custom tag sent by the SDK. The fourth is passed as part of the issue search query (which uses a CONTAINS match).

The following tokens are reserved and known to Sentry:

`is`

: Filter on the status of an issue.

  Values are `resolved`, `unresolved`, `ignored`, `assigned`, and `unassigned`.

`assigned`

: Filter on the user which the issue is assigned to.

  Values can be your user ID (your email address) or `me` for yourself.

`bookmarks`

: Filter on the user which the issue is bookmarked by.

  Values can be your user ID (your email address) or `me` for yourself.

`has`

: Restrict results to issues which have _any_ value for a tag.

  `has:user`

`release`

: Restrict results to issues seen within the given release.

  Exact match on the version of a release.

`first-release`

: Restrict results to issues first seen within the given release.

  Exact match on the version of a release.

`user.id`
`user.email`
`user.username`
`user.ip`

: Restrict results to issues affecting the given user.

`age`

: Restrict results to issues created since `age`. The syntax is similar to the unix `find` command:

  Issues new in the last 24 hours:

  `age:-24h`

  Issues older than 12 hours:

  `age:+12h`

  Issues created between 12 and 24 hours ago:

  `age:+12h age:-24h`

  Supported suffixes:

  `m -> minutes` `h -> hours` `d -> days` `w -> weeks`

`event.timestamp`

: Restrict results to issues in which an event occurred at the given timestamp. This filter can be passed twice to provide a range.

  Events occurred on January 2nd 2016:

  `event.timestamp:2016-01-02`

  Events between 01:00 and 02:00 (UTC):

  `event.timestamp:>=2016-01-02T01:00:00 event.timestamp:<2016-01-02T02:00:00`

  The following comparative operators are available:

  -   greater than (`>`)
  -   greater than or equal (`>=`)
  -   less than (`<`)
  -   less than or equal (`<=`)

`timesSeen`

: Restrict results to issues that have been seen exactly, at least, or at most some number of times.

  Exact match:

  `timesSeen:10`

  Upper or lower bounds:

  -   `timesSeen:>10`
  -   `timesSeen:>=10`
  -   `timesSeen:<10`
  -   `timesSeen:<=10`

`lastSeen`

: Restrict results that were last seen since or until a given point in time. Usage is similar to the `age` token (see above).

  Issues last seen 30 days ago or more:

  `lastSeen:+30d`

  Issues last seen within the last two days:

  `lastSeen:-2d`

Additionally you can use any tag youâ€™ve specified as a token.

## Saving Searches

You have the ability to save a search by performing the search, clicking the dropdown arrow next to the Current Search, and then "Save Current Search".

[{% asset save-current-search.png %}]({% asset save-current-search.png @path %})

## Set a Default Search

You can specify which search should be the default search when the Issues list is first viewed.

This can be done by clicking the dropdown arrow next to the current search, clicking "Manage", and then specifying default for yourself or your team.

[{% asset default-search.png %}]({% asset default-search.png @path %})
