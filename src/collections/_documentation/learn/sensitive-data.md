As with any third party service it’s important to understand what data is being sent to Sentry, and where relevant ensure sensitive data either never reaches the Sentry servers, or at the very least it doesn’t get stored. Our primary approach to this problem is a pessimitic view: you accidentally sent data to Sentry and you either want to remove it, or you want to ensure it doesn’t get stored.

## Server-Side Filtering

Within your project settings you’ll find a **Data Scrubber** option. By default this is enabled, and we highly recommend you keep it that way. With it enabled Sentry will scrub the following:

-   Values that look like they contain credit cards (using a basic regular expression)
-   Keys that contain any of the following values:
    -   password
    -   secret
    -   passwd
    -   api_key
    -   apikey
    -   access_token
    -   auth_token
    -   credentials
    -   mysql_pwd
    -   stripetoken
    -   card[number]
-   Any keys which match values that you’ve added to the list of additional fields in your Project Settings.

You can choose to expand the keys which are scrubbed by the server, as well as prevent IP addresses from being stored. The latter is particularly important if you’re concerned about PII and using our Browser JavaScript SDK.

Additionally some SDKs will also allow you to filter data ahead of time following similar patterns.

## Restricting Emails

It’s common that compliance within your company may mean that data can only be transmitted over SSL and stored in a secure manner. One common area this comes up is with email notifications. By default Sentry will send a large amount of data as part of the issue notification. In some cases this data may be source code or other user data.

To work around this problem you can enable the **Enhanced Privacy** setting in your organization. This can be done by visiting the organization’s dashboard, clicking **Settings**, and then ticking the option there. Once done parts of the system, primarily email notifications, will immediately reflect this change and begin restricting data to only basic attributes such as the issue title and description.

## Removing Data

If you’ve accidentally sent sensitive data to the server it’s likely you’re not going to want to leave it there. There are a few things to note in removal:

-   If you send it as a tagged value, removing the event is not enough. You can visit Project Settings and under Tags you’ll find a way to permanently remove any related data for a given tag.
-   If you need to wipe just a single event, you’ll find the ability to bulk delete all sampled events under a rollup by visiting the rollup details page and selecting “Delete”.
-   If you send sparse events to a project (potentially all of them), your only option is to remove the project and re-create it. Keep in mind this will revoke API credentials, so you likely want to do this in the reverse order.

## Custom Event Processing in the SDK

In the SDKs you can also set a function `before-send` which is invoked before events are sent which can be used to modify the events and remove bad data. See [_Filtering Events_]({%- link _documentation/learn/filtering.md -%}) for more information.

## Custom Event Processing using Relay

In addition you have the option to put a proxy between your applications and Sentry that can strip sensitive data from your events. Head over to [_Relay_]({%- link _documentation/relay/index.md -%}).
