## PDB Age Mismatches

Microsoft PDBs compose their identifiers from two parts: A unique signature and
an age field. The signature is generated when the PDB is written initially and
usually changes with every build. The age is a counter that is incremented every
time the PDB is modified.

PE files, such as executables and dynamic libraries, specify the full identifier
of the corresponding PDB in their header. This includes the age. If the PDB is
modified after the PE has been generated, however, its age might diverge. This
can lead to different identifiers:

```
PE:  3003763b-afcb-4a97-aae3-28de8f188d7c-2
PDB: 3003763b-afcb-4a97-aae3-28de8f188d7c-4
```

`sentry-cli` can detect these differences during the upload process and
associates the same identifier to both files. However, this requires that both
files are uploaded in the same invocation of the upload command. Otherwise, the
identifiers diverge and Sentry might not be able to resolve the correct file
for symbolication.
