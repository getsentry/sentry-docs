## Add Readable Stack Traces to Errors

To get readable stack traces in your production builds, set the `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable in your build environment. You can also add the environment variable to a `.env.sentry-build-plugin` file in the root of your project.

<OrgAuthTokenNote />

```bash {filename:.env.sentry-build-plugin}
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=___ORG_AUTH_TOKEN___
```

This, in combination with your `sourceMapsUploadOptions` configuration, will <PlatformLink to="/sourcemaps">upload source maps</PlatformLink> to Sentry every time you make a production build.
