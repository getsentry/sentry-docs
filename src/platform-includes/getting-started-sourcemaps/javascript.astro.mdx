## Add Readable Stack Traces to Errors

To get readable stack traces in your production builds, add the `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable to your environment, like in a `.env` file or in your CI setup.

<OrgAuthTokenNote />

```bash {filename:.env}
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=___ORG_AUTH_TOKEN___
```

This, in combination with your `sourceMapsUploadOptions` configuration, will <PlatformLink to="/sourcemaps">upload source maps</PlatformLink> to Sentry every time you make a production build.
