## Add Readable Stack Traces to Errors

To get readable stack traces in your production builds, add the `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable to your environment (e.g. via a `.env` file or in your CI setup).

<OrgAuthTokenNote />

```bash {filename:.env}
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=___ORG_AUTH_TOKEN___
```

This, in combination with your `sourceMapsUploadOptions` configuration, will upload source maps to Sentry every time you make a production build.
