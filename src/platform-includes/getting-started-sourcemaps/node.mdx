## Add Readable Stack Traces to Errors

Depending on how you've set up your Node project, the stack traces in your Sentry errors probably don't look like your actual code.

To fix this, upload your source maps to Sentry. The easiest way to do this is to use the Sentry Wizard:

<Include name="sourcemaps-wizard-instructions.mdx" />

For more information on source maps or for more options to upload them, head over to our <PlatformLink to="/sourcemaps/">Source Maps</PlatformLink> documentation.
