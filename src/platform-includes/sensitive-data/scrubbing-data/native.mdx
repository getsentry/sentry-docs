## Scrubbing Data

### <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send" /> & <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send-transaction" />

SDKs provide a <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send" /> hook, which is invoked before an error or message event is sent and can be used to modify event data to remove sensitive information. Some SDKs also provide a <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send-transaction" /> hook which does the same thing for transactions. We recommend using <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send" /> and <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send-transaction" /> in the SDKs to **scrub any data before it is sent**, to ensure that sensitive data never leaves the local environment.

<PlatformContent includePath="configuration/before-send/" />

Sensitive data may appear in the following areas:

- Stack-locals → Some SDKs (Python, PHP and Node) will pick up variable values within the stack trace. These can be scrubbed, or this behavior can be disabled altogether if necessary.
- Breadcrumbs → Some SDKs (JavaScript and the Java logging integrations, for example) will pick up previously executed log statements. **Do not log PII** if using this feature and including log statements as breadcrumbs in the event. Some backend SDKs will also record database queries, which may need to be scrubbed.
- User context → Automated behavior is controlled via <PlatformIdentifier name="send-default-pii" />.
- HTTP context → Query strings may be picked up in some frameworks as part of the HTTP request context.
- Transaction Names → In certain situations, transaction names might contain sensitive data. For example, a browser's pageload transaction might have a raw URL like `/users/1234/details` as its name (where `1234` is a user id, which may be considered PII). In most cases, our SDKs can parameterize URLs and routes successfully, that is, turn `/users/1234/details` into `/users/:userid/details`. However, depending on the framework, your routing configuration, race conditions, and a few other factors, the SDKs might not be able to completely parameterize all of your URLs.

### Examples

**Contextual information**

Instead of sending confidential information in plaintext, consider hashing it:

<PlatformContent includePath="sensitive-data/set-tag/" />

This will allow you to correlate it within internal systems if needed, but keep it confidential from Sentry.

**User details**

Your organization may determine that emails are not considered confidential, but if they are, consider instead sending your internal identifier:

<PlatformContent includePath="sensitive-data/set-user/" />

Doing this will ensure you still benefit from user-impact related features.

**Logging integrations**

As a best practice you should always avoid logging confidential information. If you have legacy systems you need to work around, consider the following:

- Anonymize the confidential information within the log statements (for example, swap out email addresses -> for internal identifiers)
- Use <PlatformIdentifier name="before-breadcrumb" /> to filter it out from breadcrumbs before it is attached
- Disable logging breadcrumb integration (for example, as described [here](/platforms/javascript/configuration/integrations/breadcrumbs/))
