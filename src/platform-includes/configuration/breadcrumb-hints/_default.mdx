`event`

: For breadcrumbs created from browser events, the Sentry SDK often supplies the event to the breadcrumb as a hint. This can be used to extract data from the target DOM element into a breadcrumb, for example.

`level` / `input`

: For breadcrumbs created from console log interceptions. This holds the original console log level and the original input data to the log function.

`response` / `input`

: For breadcrumbs created from HTTP requests. This holds the response object (from the fetch API) and the input parameters to the fetch function.

`request` / `response` / `event`

: For breadcrumbs created from HTTP requests. This holds the request and response object (from the node HTTP API) as well as the node event (`response` or `error`).

`xhr`

: For breadcrumbs created from HTTP requests made using the legacy `XMLHttpRequest` API. This holds the original `xhr` object.
