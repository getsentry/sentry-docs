To benefit from the health data, you must use _at least_ version 5.0.0 of the Cocoa SDK and enable the it in the initialization options of the SDK. Release health is captured, by default, in version 6.0 and higher, unless you specifically disabled collecting it in the initialization options for the SDK.

By default, the session is terminated once the application is in the background for more than 30 seconds. You can change the time out with the option named `sessionTrackingIntervalMillis`. It takes the amount in milliseconds. For example, to configure it to be 60 seconds:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    options.sessionTrackingIntervalMillis = 60000
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithOptions:@{
    @"dsn": @"___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    @"sessionTrackingIntervalMillis": @60000
}];
```

If you'd like to opt out of this feature, you can do so using options:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    // If you prefer NOT to track release health.
    options.enableAutoSessionTracking = false
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithOptions:@{
    @"dsn": @"___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    // If you prefer NOT to track release health.
    @"enableAutoSessionTracking": @(NO)
}];
```
