To benefit from the health data, you must use at least version 0.4.0 of the Rust SDK.

By default, the session is terminated once the application is in the background for more than 30 seconds. You can change the time out with the option named `sessionTrackingIntervalMillis`. It takes the amount in milliseconds. For example, to configure it to be 60 seconds:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  await SentryFlutter.init(
    (options) => options.autoSessionTrackingIntervalMillis = 60000
    appRunner: () => runApp(MyApp()),
  );
}
```

If you'd like to opt out of this feature, you can do so using options.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  await SentryFlutter.init(
    (options) => options.enableAutoSessionTracking = true, // it's enabled by default
    appRunner: () => runApp(MyApp()),
  );
}
```
