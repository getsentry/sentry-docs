By default, the Electron SDK tracks sessions via the `MainProcessSession` integration. This captures sessions linked to the lifetime of the Electron main process.

We mark the session as:

- `crashed` if a native crash takes down the main or a renderer processes.
- `abnormal` if on startup, the previous session had not been finished.
- `error` if the SDK captures an event that contains an exception (this includes manually captured errors).

Due to the nature of `crashed` and `abnormal` exits, these sessions are finished and uploaded at the next app start.

To receive data on user adoption, such as users crash free rate percentage, and the number of users that have adopted a specific release, set the user on the [`initialScope`](/platforms/javascript/configuration/options/#initial-scope) when initializing the SDK.

To disable sending sessions, set the `autoSessionTracking` flag to `false`:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  autoSessionTracking: false, // default: true
});
```
