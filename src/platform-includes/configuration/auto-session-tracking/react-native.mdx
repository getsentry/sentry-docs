To benefit from the health data, you must use at least version 1.4.0 of the React Native SDK and enable the collection of the release health data in the initialization options of the SDK.

We mark the session as an error if the SDK captures an event that contains an exception (this includes manually captured errors) or an unhandled promise rejection, but for unhandled errors and native crashes (Android and iOS), they will be marked as crashed.

By default, the SDK sends sessions. To disable this, set the `enableAutoSessionTracking` flag to `false`:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  enableAutoSessionTracking: false, // default: true
});
```

The session terminates once the application is in the background for more than 30 seconds. To change the timeout, use the option `sessionTrackingIntervalMillis`. For example:

```javascript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react-native';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
  enableAutoSessionTracking: true,
  // Sessions close after app is 10 seconds in the background.
  sessionTrackingIntervalMillis: 10000,
});
```
