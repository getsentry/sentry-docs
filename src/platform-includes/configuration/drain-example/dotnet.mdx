The .NET SDK gracefully handles shutdown, waiting up to `ShutdownTimeout` seconds to flush captured events.

This happens in a variety of different situations:

- Automatically, in the case of a normal application exit.
- Automatically, in the case of an unhandled exception.
- Automatically, for integrations that use dependency injection (`UseSentry`, `AddSentry`, etc.).
- Manually, if you dispose of the result of `SentrySdk.Init` (which is optional).
- Manually, if you call `SentrySdk.Flush` or `SentrySdk.FlushAsync`.

In most cases, you can rely on the automatic approaches and don't need to worry about this.
