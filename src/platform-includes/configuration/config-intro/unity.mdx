## Programmatic Configuration

In order to provide native crash support, the Sentry SDK for Unity includes [platform-specific (that is, Native)](/platforms/unity/native-support/) SDKs, such as [Android](/platforms/android/), [Apple](/platforms/apple/guides/ios/), and [Native](/platforms/native/). Those SDKs share the options with which they get initialized.

The C# layer self-initializes through the use of the [BeforeSceneLoad RuntimeInitializeOnLoadMethodAttribute](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/RuntimeInitializeLoadType.BeforeSceneLoad.html). On desktop, the C# layer is also responsible for intializing the native SDKs.

On mobile, the native SDKs are configured and set up during build time and initialize themselves before the Unity engine. This allows us to capture bugs/crashes of the engine itself. For that reason, we rely on on the options being set in the Sentry editor configuration window and saved to `Assets/Resources/Sentry/SentryOptions.asset`.

To provide a way to modify options programmatically, we've added `ScriptableOptionsConfiguration` to the `Options Config` tab in the Sentry editor window.

There are two situations when a scriptable configuration object comes into play:

- `Runtime Options Script` is executed on each app startup, right before the managed Sentry SDK is initialized (except for Android, iOS, and macOS native layers, which are already set up by that time).
  An example of how this can be used is for implementing your own filtering of events using the [BeforeSend](/platforms/unity/configuration/filtering/#using-platformidentifier-namebefore-send-) callback.
  (This callback only runs for events coming from C# scripts.)

- `Buildtime Options Script` - is executed by the Unity Editor during app build.
  Changes you make here affect the current build and also allow you to alter native platform build-time settings (Android, iOS, macOS).

<Note>
  Not all options can be used on all platforms, also some may need to be changed
  at build-time, others at runtime. In most cases it's safe for both functions
  to run the same code.
