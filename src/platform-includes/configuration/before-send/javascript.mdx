In JavaScript, you can use a function to modify the event or return a completely new one.
You can either return `null` or an event payload - no other return value (including `void`) is allowed.
If you return `null`, the event will be discarded.

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',

  // Called for message and error events
  beforeSend(event) {
    // Modify or drop the event here
    if (event.user) {
      // Don't send user's email address
      delete event.user.email;
    }
    return event;
  },
});
```
