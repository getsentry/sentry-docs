The `sentry-cocoa` SDK always marks public frameworks such as UIKitCore, CoreFoundation, GraphicsServices, and so forth as `not inApp`. Before version 7.0.0, the sentry-cocoa SDK marks all private frameworks and the main executable inside the application bundle as `inApp`. Since version 7.0.0, the sentry-cocoa SDK sets the `inApp` flag only for frames originating from the main executable by using the [CFBundleExecutable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/cfbundleexecutable). For private frameworks, such as Sentry, dynamic and static frameworks differ. If you are not familiar with these terms, you can learn more:

- [Dynamic Library Programming Topics](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/DynamicLibraries/000-Introduction/Introduction.html)

## Dynamic Frameworks

If you use dynamic frameworks, such as, for example, Sentry, the SDK marks these as `not inApp`. In case you have a private framework that should be `inApp`, you can use [`inAppInclude`](/platforms/apple/configuration/options/#in-app-include) or [`inAppExclude`](/platforms/apple/configuration/options/#in-app-exclude) of the SentryOptions.

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"

    // The SDK marks all frameworks starting with MyBusinessLogic as inApp
    options.add(inAppInclude: "MyBusinessLogic")

    // The SDK marks all frameworks starting with MyFramework as not inApp
    options.add(inAppExclude: "MyFramework")
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";

    // The SDK marks all frameworks starting with MyBusinessLogic as inApp
    [options addInAppInclude:@"MyBusinessLogic"];

    // The SDK marks all framework starting with MyFramework as not inApp
    [options addInAppExclude:@"MyFramework"];
}];
```

## Static Frameworks

When using static frameworks, the frameworks end up in the main executable. Therefore, the SDK currently can't detect if a frame of the main executable
originates from your application or a private framework and marks all of them as `inApp`. To improve your experience, use the below explained stack trace rules on the server to tell Sentry which should be marked as `not inApp`.
