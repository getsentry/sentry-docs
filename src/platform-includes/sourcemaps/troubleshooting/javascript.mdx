Source maps can sometimes be tricky to get going. If you're having trouble, you can try using our verification tool inside `sentry-cli`, or go through the steps listed below yourself.

To use the automated verification process, [install and configure](/product/cli/) `sentry-cli`. Once completed, use the `sourcemaps explain` command, by calling it with the event ID that can be found in the top-left corner of the **Issue Details** page in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io). For example, "Event ID: fb71278d".

```shell
sentry-cli sourcemaps explain fb71278d620c4bb3a32e38b24b8a61e7
```

This should provide you with some useful hints about what exactly went wrong with the source maps setup process.
If it doesn't, let us know so we can make it better.

## Verify artifacts are uploaded

You can find the artifacts uploaded to Sentry by navigating to **[Settings] » Projects » Select your project » Source Maps**.

Make sure all of the necessary files are available. For Sentry to de-minify your stack traces you must provide both the minified files (for example, app.min.js) and the corresponding source maps. In case the source map files do not contain your original source code (`sourcesContent`), you must additionally provide the original source files. Alternatively, sentry-cli will automatically embed the sources (if missing) into your source maps.

## Verify you are building sourcemaps

Bundlers and tools (like `tsc`) that generate code generally require you to manually set options in order for source maps to be generated.

If you followed our tool-specific guides, verify that you configured your tool to emit source maps and that the source maps contain your original source code inside the `sourcesContent` field.

## Verify your source files contain debug ID injection snippets

Inside the JavaScript files you uploaded to Sentry, search for code that roughly looks like `e._sentryDebugIds=e._sentryDebugIds||{}`. Having this code inside a bundle means that it will be able to be matched to a source file. Every bundle you deploy in your app needs to have this snippet in order to be correctly source mapped.

If your source code does not have the snippet and if you're using a Sentry plugin for your bundler, please check that you are using the latest version and please verify that the plugin is correctly processing your files. You can set the `debug` option to `true` in order to print useful information.

If you are using Sentry CLI, please verify that you are running the `inject` command **before** you're uploading to Sentry and **before** you're deploying your files.

## Verify your events contain debug metadata

When inspecting the event payload JSON data in Sentry, verify that the events have a `debug_meta` property. If this property is missing and you already made sure your source files contain debug ID injection snippets, this likely means that you're using an outdated SDK. We generally recommend upgrading to the latest version, but for source maps to work you need to at least use version `7.47.0`.

When you verified that your event has a `debug_meta` property, the next thing to check is whether all frames inside the `raw_stacktrace` property inside the events have an `abs_path` property that exactly matches one of the `code_file` properties inside the `debug_meta` images.

If a stack frame doesn't match an entry inside `debug_meta`, make sure that the relevant file contains a debug ID injection snippet.

## Verify artifacts are uploaded before errors occur

Sentry expects that source code and source maps in a given release are uploaded to Sentry **before** errors occur in that release.

If you upload artifacts **after** an error is captured by Sentry, Sentry will not go back and retroactively apply any source annotations to those errors. Only new errors triggered after the artifact was uploaded will be affected.

## Verify your source maps are built correctly

We maintain an online validation tool that can be used to test your source maps against your **hosted** source: [sourcemaps.io](https://sourcemaps.io).

Alternatively, if you are using Sentry CLI to upload source maps to Sentry, you can use the `--validate` command line option to verify your source maps are correct.

## Verify your source maps work locally

If you find that Sentry is not mapping filename, line, or column mappings correctly, you should verify that your source maps are functioning locally. To do so, you can use Node.js coupled with Mozilla's [source-map library](https://github.com/mozilla/source-map).

First, install `source-map` globally as an npm module:

```bash
npm install -g source-map
```

Then, write a Node.js script that reads your source map file and tests a mapping. Here's an example:

```javascript
var fs = require("fs"),
  path = require("path"),
  sourceMap = require("source-map");

// Path to file that is generated by your build tool (webpack, tsc, ...)
var GENERATED_FILE = path.join(".", "app.min.js.map");

// Line and column located in your generated file (for example, the source
// of the error from your minified file)
var GENERATED_LINE_AND_COLUMN = { line: 1, column: 1000 };

var rawSourceMap = fs.readFileSync(GENERATED_FILE).toString();
new sourceMap.SourceMapConsumer(rawSourceMap).then(function (smc) {
  var pos = smc.originalPositionFor(GENERATED_LINE_AND_COLUMN);

  // You should see something like:
  // { source: 'original.js', line: 57, column: 9, name: 'myfunc' }
  console.log(pos);
});
```

If you have the same (incorrect) results locally as you do via Sentry, double-check your source map generation configuration.

## Verify your source files are not too large

For an individual artifact, Sentry accepts a max filesize of **40 MB**.

Often users hit this limit because they are transmitting source files at an interim build stage. For example, after your bundler has combined all your source files, but before minification has taken place. If possible, send the original source files.

## Verify artifacts are not gzipped

The Sentry API currently only works with source maps and source files that are uploaded as plain text (UTF-8 encoded). If the files are uploaded in a compressed format (for example, gzip), they will be not be interpreted correctly.

If you are using `sentry-cli` to upload your artifacts, starting with version `2.4.0` you can add the `--decompress` flag to your `sourcemaps upload` or `files upload` commands.

Sometimes build scripts and plugins produce pre-compressed minified files (for example, Webpack's [compression plugin](https://github.com/webpack/compression-webpack-plugin)). In these cases, you'll need to disable such plugins and perform the compression **after** the generated source maps/source files have been uploaded to Sentry.

## Verify workers are sharing the same volume as web (if running self-hosted Sentry via Docker)

Sentry does source map calculation in its workers. This means the workers need access to the files uploaded through the front end. Double check that the cron workers and web workers can read/write files from the same disk.

## Verify you are not using the `source-map-support` package

The Sentry Node.js SDK generally works well with the [source-map-support](https://www.npmjs.com/package/source-map-support) package if you don't already have source maps uploaded to Sentry.

If you are uploading source maps to Sentry or if you are using a Sentry SDK in the browser, your code cannot use the `source-map-support` package.
`source-map-support` overwrites the captured stack trace in a way that prevents our source map processors from correctly parsing it.
