## Uploading Source Maps using Vite

If you are using Vue, chances are good you are using Vite to bundle your project.
You can use the Sentry Vite plugin to automatically create [releases](/product/releases/) and upload source maps to Sentry when bundling your app.

### Installation

```npm
npm install @sentry/vite-plugin --save-dev
```

```yarn
yarn add @sentry/vite-plugin --dev
```

### Configuration

Learn more about configuring the plugin in our [Sentry Vite Plugin documentation](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript-bundler-plugins/tree/main/packages/vite-plugin).

Example:

```javascript {filename:vite.config.js}
import { fileURLToPath, URL } from "node:url";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import vue from "@vitejs/plugin-vue";
import sentryVitePlugin from "@sentry/vite-plugin";

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  build: {
    sourcemap: true, // Source map generation must be turned on
  },
  plugins: [
    vue(),

    // Put the Sentry vite plugin after all other plugins
    sentryVitePlugin({
      org: "___ORG_SLUG___",
      project: "___PROJECT_SLUG___",

      // Specify the directory containing build artifacts
      include: "./dist",

      // Auth tokens can be obtained from https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/
      // and needs the `project:releases` and `org:read` scopes
      authToken: process.env.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN,

      // Optionally uncomment the line below to override automatic release name detection
      // release: process.env.RELEASE,
    }),
  ],
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      "@": fileURLToPath(new URL("./src", import.meta.url)),
    },
  },
});
```

The Sentry Vite plugin will automatically inject a release value into the SDK so you must either omit the `release` option from `Sentry.init` or make sure `Sentry.init`'s `release` option matches the plugin's `release` option exactly:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // When using the plugin, either remove the `release`` property here entirely or
  // make sure that the plugin's release option and the Sentry.init()'s release
  // option match exactly.
  // release: "my-example-release-1"
});
```

## Other Bundlers

In case you are using a bundler other than Vite to build your Vue project, we've compiled a list of guides on how to upload source maps to Sentry for the most popular JavaScript bundlers:

- <PlatformLink to="/sourcemaps/uploading/webpack/">Webpack</PlatformLink>
- <PlatformLink to="/sourcemaps/uploading/typescript/">TypeScript (tsc)</PlatformLink>
- <PlatformLink to="/sourcemaps/uploading/rollup/">Rollup</PlatformLink>
- <PlatformLink to="/sourcemaps/uploading/esbuild/">esbuild</PlatformLink>

## Other Tools

If you're not using any of tools above, we assume you already know how to generate source maps with your toolchain and we recommend you upload them using <PlatformLink to="/sourcemaps/uploading/cli/">Sentry CLI</PlatformLink>.

<Note>

Though we strongly recommend uploading source maps as part of your build process, for browser applications it's also possible to <PlatformLink to="/sourcemaps/uploading/hosting-publicly/">host your source maps publicly</PlatformLink>.
