Integrate your project's source maps with Sentry using these steps:

### 1: Generate Source Maps

Source maps can be generated by transpilers, minifiers, or bundlers you might be using in your project. We provide instructions to configure common tools that output source maps [here](./generating/).

### 2: Provide Source Maps to Sentry

<PlatformSection notSupported={["node"]}>

Source maps can be either:

1.  Uploaded directly to Sentry (**strongly recommended**)
2.  Served publicly over HTTP alongside your deployed code

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection notSupported={["javascript"]} supported={["node"]}>

For Node.js projects, bundles and source maps need to be uploaded to Sentry.

</PlatformSection>

If you use [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) in your project, we recommend generating and uploading your source maps by way of [`sentry-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-webpack-plugin). If you use a different tool to generate source maps, you can use [`sentry-cli`](/product/cli/) to upload them to Sentry.

Learn more about how to upload source maps [here](./uploading).

<PlatformSection notSupported={["node"]}>

If you host your source maps alongside your deployed code, make sure your code files end with a ``//# sourceMappingURL` comment pointing to the corresponding map.

Learn more about publicly hosting source maps [here](./uploading/hosting-publicly/).

<Note>

By default, if Sentry can't find the uploaded files it needs, it will attempt to download them from the URLs in the stacktrace. To disable this, turn off "Enable JavaScript source fetching" in either your organization's "Security & Privacy" settings or your project's general settings.
