## Uploading Source Maps in an Angular project

Sentry uses [releases](/product/releases/) to match the correct source maps to your events.
This page explains how to generate source maps, set releases, and upload source maps to Sentry either manually or automatically when bundling your Angular app.

### Generating Source Maps

To generate source maps, you need to add the `sourceMap` option to your `angular.json` build configuration:

```json {filename:angular.json}
{
  // ...
  "projects": {
    "my-app": {
      "architect": {
        "build": {
          "configurations": {
            "production": {
              "sourceMap": {
                "scripts": true
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Ways to Upload Source Maps

To upload your Angular project's source maps to Sentry, we recommend one of these options:

- [**Angular CLI and Sentry Webpack Plugin**](./uploading/angular-webpack/) <br/>
  Use the Angular CLI, a custom Angular builder and the Sentry Webpack plugin to set releases and upload source maps automatically when running `ng build`.
- [**Nx Angular CLI and Sentry Webpack Plugin**](./uploading/angular-nx/) <br/>
  If you're using Nx, use `@nx/angular` CLI and the Sentry Webpack plugin to set releases and upload source maps automatically when running `nx build`.
- [**Sentry CLI**](./uploading/cli/)<br/>
  Upload source maps manually using the Sentry CLI.

Take a look at this [guide for further options to upload source maps](./uploading/).
