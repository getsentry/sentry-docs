Integrate your Remix project's source maps with Sentry using these steps:

### 1: Generate Source Maps

Remix can be configured to output source maps using Remix CLI. Learn more about [how to generate source maps with Remix](./generating/).

### 2: Provide Source Maps to Sentry

Source maps can be uploaded to Sentry by creating a release. Learn more about [how to upload source maps](./uploading/).


### 3: Remove Remix Source Maps 

Remix validly discourages the user to have source maps in production. After uploading the maps to Sentry we suggest you delete the `.map` files, here's a simple example in bash:

```bash
rm ./public/**/*.map
rm ./build/**/*.map 
```

<Note>

By default, if Sentry can't find the uploaded files it needs, it will attempt to download them from the URLs in the stack trace. To disable this, turn off "Enable JavaScript source fetching" in either your organization's "Security & Privacy" settings or your project's general settings.
