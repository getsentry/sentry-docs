## Upload Source Maps for a Remix Project

Sentry uses [releases](/product/releases/) to match the correct source maps to your events.
This page is a guide on how to create releases and upload source maps to Sentry when bundling your Remix app.

### 1. Generate Source Maps

To generate source maps with your Remix project, you need to call `remix build` with the `--sourcemap` option.

Please refer to the [Remix CLI docs](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/other-api/dev#remix-cli) for more information.

### 2. Create a Release and Upload Source Maps

The Sentry Remix SDK provides a script to automatically create a release and upload source maps after you've built your project.
Under the hood, it uses the Sentry CLI.

This script requires some configuration, which can either be done through a `.sentryclirc` file in the root of your project or through environment variables:

<Note>

Visit the [auth token user settings page](https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/) to find your auth tokens.

</Note>

<SignInNote />

```ini {filename:.sentryclirc}
[auth]
token=your-auth-token

[defaults]
org=___ORG_SLUG___
project=___PROJECT_SLUG___
```

```bash
export SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=your-auth-token
export SENTRY_ORG=___ORG_SLUG___
export SENTRY_PROJECT=___PROJECT_SLUG___
```

Next, run the upload script with the following command:

```bash {tabTitle:Yarn}
yarn sentry-upload-sourcemaps

# For usage details run
yarn sentry-upload-sourcemaps --help
```

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
node ./node_modules/@sentry/remix/scripts/sentry-upload-sourcemaps.js

# For usage details run
node ./node_modules/@sentry/remix/scripts/sentry-upload-sourcemaps.js --help
```

<Note>

For more advanced configuration, [use `sentry-cli` directly to upload source maps.](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cli).

</Note>

### 3. Remove Remix Source Maps

Remix validly discourages the user from hosting source maps in production. After uploading the maps to Sentry, we suggest you delete the `.map` files. Here's a simple shell command example:

```bash {tabTitle:Bash}
find ./public/build -type f -name '*.map' -delete
find ./build -type f -name '*.map' -delete
```

```bash {tabTitle:Zsh}
rm ./public/**/*.map
rm ./build/**/*.map
```

Please note that these commands might vary for the operating system or shell you use.

<Note>

By default, if Sentry can't find the uploaded files it needs, it will attempt to download them from the URLs in the stack trace. To disable this, turn off "Enable JavaScript source fetching" in either your organization's "Security & Privacy" settings or your project's general settings.
