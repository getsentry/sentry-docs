This article explains the differences between Artifact and Release Bundles, and the implications of using them. Visit [Uploading Source Maps](/platforms/javascript/guides/react/sourcemaps/uploading/) if you're looking for our guides on how to upload source maps.

## Introduction

Sentry currently supports two methods of uploading sourcemaps: **Release bundles** and **Artifact bundles**. A bundle contains all the minified sources and source maps (known as _artifacts_) required for Sentry to unminify the frames of a stack trace.

## Release Bundles

A release bundle is a bundle format that's connected to an existing `release` in Sentry. That's why you **have to create a `release`** before uploading your artifacts.

| Pros | Cons |
|:--|:--|
| Works with every SDK version. | Configuring your build pipeline to upload artifacts can be very challenging.  |
| | Requires your project to use Sentry Releases.





### How Do They Work?

Release bundles get their name from using a `release` as a way to index a specific bundle*. The `release` is extracted from an incoming error and used to look up the most recent bundle. When a bundle is found, we use the absolute path in each frame to find the corresponding minified source in the retrieved bundle. Once the minified source is found, we try to discover its source map with a series of heuristics. (For example, by looking at the `sourceURLMapping` comment or using metadata from the uploaded bundle.)

In practice, matching the paths for artifacts discovery is prone to mistmatchs that might be caused by a wrong configuration of your bundler, CI/CD pipeline...

## Artifact Bundles

### What Are They?

An artifact bundle is our new bundle format that aims to address the shortcomings of release bundles by **adding the support for Debug IDs** and **removing the need to create a `release`**.

| Pros | Cons |
|:--|:--|
| With the use of Debug IDs, configuring your build pipeline to upload artifacts is trivial | Requires a version update to Javascript SDKs, bundler plugin ( and `sentry-cli`) |
| Associating a release is still possible, but not required | May cause problems with integrity checks

### How Do They Work?

Artifact Bundles solve the challenge of matching paths by using a new identification mechanism known as Debug IDs. Rather than relying on paths we uniquely identify and bind pairs of minified sources and source maps with an Debug ID(UUID). With this, we are able to quickly identify the minified source and corresponding source map without ever needing to check any paths. Thus, you don't have to worry about wrong paths configurations.

<Note>

If you want to learn more about the rationale behind Debug IDs, we suggest taking a look at our [engineering blog](https://sentry.engineering/blog/the-case-for-debug-ids).

### Associating a Release with Artifact Bundles

Since you might still want to know to which release a specific artifact bundle is connected to, we designed a new way to still associate a `release` to your bundle.

The new Artifact Bundle format supports a new kind of association to a `release` and optionally `dist`, known as weak release association. This type of association **will not require the creation of a `release`** before uploading sourcemaps and will consequentely allow the creation of a `release` as a separate step down the pipeline.

With an associated `release` and optionally `dist` you will be able to quickly go to the Artifact Bundle from your `release` in Sentry, without having to worry about which artifact bundle was used for your errors.

## Summary
- We recommend you try Artifact Bundles with Debug IDs, if you've failed to upload source maps in the past.
- However, we recommend you continue to use Release Bundles if your application already uses them successfully.
