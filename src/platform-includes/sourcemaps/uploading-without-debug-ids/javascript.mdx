Sentry moved to a new process for handling source maps. We call this process "source mapping with debug IDs".

This process requires you to use updated Sentry dependencies. We know this isn't always possible, so this page explains how to upload source maps without debug IDs.

## When to use this guide

Use the guide on this page if you're using one of the following:

- JavaScript SDK version `7.46.0` or lower
- `@sentry/webpack-plugin` package version `1.x` or lower
- `sentry-cli` version `2.16.1` or lower
- Sentry self-hosted or single-tenant on version `23.4.0` or lower

If all of your Sentry dependencies are on more up-to-date versions than in the list above, we recommend using the regular <PlatformLink to="/sourcemaps">Source Maps</PlatformLink> guide.

If you're using one or more of these older versions of the tools, you can still upload source maps; however, the process will be different. Instead of using debug IDs, you'll use [Releases](/product/releases/) to match an event's stack frame with its corresponding minified source and source map file (known as artifacts).

To use this guide, scroll down to the section that corresponds to the tooling you're using, and follow the steps in that section:
- `sentry-cli`
- Sentry Webpack Plugin Version 1.x
- Sentry Bundler Plugins on Version 2.x

The final "[Verify Artifacts Were Uploaded](#verify-artifacts-were-uploaded)" section applies to each type of tooling.

## Uploading using `sentry-cli`

Here is our guide to uploading artifacts using [releases](/product/releases/)

### 1. Update SDK Options

To match events with the correct release, you must provide a `release` property in the SDK options:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  // This value must be identical to the name you give the release that you
  // create below using `sentry-cli`.
  release: "<release_name>",
});
```

### 2. Create a New Release

You must first create a release with `sentry-cli`. The release name must be unique within your organization:

```bash
sentry-cli releases new <release_name>
```

### 3. Upload Artifacts

Next, upload your artifacts (minified sources and source maps):

```bash
sentry-cli sourcemaps upload --release=<release_name> /path/to/directory
```

## Uploading using Sentry Webpack Plugin Version 1.x

Assuming you have the `@sentry/webpack` package installed on version `1.x`, you can learn more on how to configure the plugin in the [Sentry Webpack Plugin v1 documentation](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-webpack-plugin#readme).

Example:

```javascript {filename:webpack.config.js}
const SentryWebpackPlugin = require("@sentry/webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  // ... other config above ...

  devtool: "source-map", // Source map generation must be turned on
  plugins: [
    new SentryWebpackPlugin({
      org: "___ORG_SLUG___",
      project: "___PROJECT_SLUG___",

      // Specify the directory containing build artifacts
      include: "./dist",

      // Auth tokens can be obtained from https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/
      // and needs the `project:releases` and `org:read` scopes
      authToken: process.env.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN,

      // Optionally uncomment the line below to override automatic release name detection
      // release: process.env.RELEASE,
    }),
  ],
};
```

The Sentry Webpack plugin will automatically inject a release value into the SDK so you must either omit the `release` option from `Sentry.init` or make sure `Sentry.init`'s `release` option matches the plugin's `release` option exactly:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // When using the plugin, either remove the `release`` property here entirely or
  // make sure that the plugin's release option and the Sentry.init()'s release
  // option match exactly.
  // release: "my-example-release-1"
});
```

## Uploading using Sentry Bundler Plugins on Version `2.x`

If you are using a Sentry self-hosted or single-tenant on version `23.4.0` or lower, or you are using the Sentry JavaScript SDK on version `7.46.0` you will need to configure the bundler plugins with the `release.uploadLegacySourcemaps` option.

This applies when using the following packages on version `2.x` and above:

- `@sentry/webpack-plugin`
- `@sentry/vite-plugin`
- `@sentry/esbuild-plugin`
- `@sentry/rollup-plugin`

Example of using the `release.uploadLegacySourcemaps` option:

```javascript {filename:webpack.config.js} {tabTitle:Webpack}
const { sentryWebpackPlugin } = require("@sentry/webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  // ... other config above ...

  devtool: "source-map", // Source map generation must be turned on
  plugins: [
    sentryWebpackPlugin({
      org: "___ORG_SLUG___",
      project: "___PROJECT_SLUG___",

      // Auth tokens can be obtained from https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/
      // and need `project:releases` and `org:read` scopes
      authToken: process.env.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN,

      release: {
        uploadLegacySourcemaps: {
          paths: ["."],
          ignore: ["./node_modules"],
        },
      },
    }),
  ],
};
```

```javascript {filename:vite.config.js} {tabTitle:Vite}
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import { sentryVitePlugin } from "@sentry/vite-plugin";

export default defineConfig({
  return {
    build: {
      sourcemap: true, // Source map generation must be turned on
    },
    plugins: [
      // Put the Sentry vite plugin after all other plugins
      sentryVitePlugin({
        org: "___ORG_SLUG___",
        project: "___PROJECT_SLUG___",

        // Auth tokens can be obtained from https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/
        // and need `project:releases` and `org:read` scopes
        authToken: process.env.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN,

        release: {
          uploadLegacySourcemaps: {
            paths: ["."],
            ignore: ["./node_modules"],
          },
        },
      }),
    ],
  };
});
```

```javascript {filename:esbuild.config.js} {tabTitle:esbuild}
const { sentryEsbuildPlugin } = require("@sentry/esbuild-plugin");

require("esbuild").build({
  sourcemap: true, // Source map generation must be turned on
  plugins: [
    // Put the Sentry esbuild plugin after all other plugins
    sentryEsbuildPlugin({
      org: "___ORG_SLUG___",
      project: "___PROJECT_SLUG___",

      // Auth tokens can be obtained from https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/
      // and need `project:releases` and `org:read` scopes
      authToken: process.env.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN,

      release: {
        uploadLegacySourcemaps: {
          paths: ["."],
          ignore: ["./node_modules"],
        },
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

```javascript {filename:rollup.config.js} {tabTitle:Rollup}
import { sentryRollupPlugin } from "@sentry/rollup-plugin";

export default {
  plugins: [
    // Put the Sentry rollup plugin after all other plugins
    sentryRollupPlugin({
      org: "___ORG_SLUG___",
      project: "___PROJECT_SLUG___",

      // Auth tokens can be obtained from https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/
      // and need `project:releases` and `org:read` scopes
      authToken: process.env.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN,

      release: {
        uploadLegacySourcemaps: {
          paths: ["."],
          ignore: ["./node_modules"],
        },
      },
    }),
  ],
  output: {
    sourcemap: true, // Source map generation must be turned on
  },
};
```

The Sentry bundler plugins will automatically inject a release value into the SDK so you must either omit the `release` option from `Sentry.init` or make sure `Sentry.init`'s `release` option matches the plugin's `release.name` option exactly:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // When using one of the plugins, either remove the `release`` property here entirely or
  // make sure that the plugin's `release.name` option and the Sentry.init()'s release
  // option match exactly.
  // release: "my-example-release-1"
});
```

## Verify Artifacts Were Uploaded

Open up Sentry and navigate to **[Settings] > Projects > Select your project > Source Maps** on Sentry.
