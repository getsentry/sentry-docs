Sentry moved to a new process for handling source maps. We call this process "source mapping with debug IDs".

This process requires your application to use a very recent SDK and bundler plugin (or sentry-cli) version. We know this isn't always possible, so this page explains how to upload source maps without Debug IDs.

## When to use this guide

Use the guide on this page if you're using one of the following:

- JavaScript SDK: version `7.46.0` or lower
- Bundler Plugins
  - `@sentry/webpack-plugin` package: version `2.1.0` or lower
  - `@sentry/vite-plugin` package: version `0.7.1` or lower
  - `@sentry/esbuild-plugin` package: version `0.7.1` or lower
  - `@sentry/rollup-plugin` package: version `0.7.1` or lower
- `sentry-cli`: version `2.16.1` or lower

If all of your Sentry dependencies are on more up-to-date versions than in the list above, we recommend using the regular <PlatformLink to="/sourcemaps">Source Maps</PlatformLink> guide.

If you're using one of our bundler plugins, we also recommend using the regular <PlatformLink to="/sourcemaps">Source Maps</PlatformLink> page to find the corresponding guide for your bundler.

If your application does use an older version of our SDK or bundler plugin (or sentry-cli), you can still upload source maps; however, the process will differ. Instead of using Debug IDs, you'll use releases to match an event's stack frame with its corresponding minified source and source map file (known as artifacts).

## Uploading Source Maps using `sentry-cli`

Here is our guide to uploading artifacts using [releases](/product/releases/)

### 1. Update SDK Options

To match events with the correct release, you must provide a `release` property in the SDK options:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  // This value must be identical to the name you give the release that you
  // create below using `sentry-cli`.
  release: "<release_name>",
});
```

### 2. Create a New Release

You must first create a release with `sentry-cli`. The release name must be unique within your organization:

```bash
sentry-cli releases new <release_name>
```

### 3. Upload Artifacts

Next, upload your artifacts (minified sources and source maps):

```bash
sentry-cli sourcemaps upload --release=<release_name> /path/to/directory
```

#### Verify Artifacts Were Uploaded

Open up Sentry and navigate to **[Settings] > Projects > Select your project > Source Maps** on Sentry.

## Summary

It can come with some headaches, but you can still upload source maps regardless of what version of our SDK or bundler plugin (or sentry-cli) your application depends on. Visit <PlatformLink to="/sourcemaps/troubleshooting_js">the regular Source Maps guide</PlatformLink> if you experience any problems following our guides.
