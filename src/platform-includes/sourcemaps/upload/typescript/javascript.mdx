<Note>

This guide is only applicable if you're using `tsc` to compile your project. If you use another tool (such as Webpack) in combination with TypeScript, you'll most likely want to follow that guide instead.

</Note>

Sentry uses [releases](/product/releases/) to match the correct source maps to your events.
If you're using TypeScript (`tsc`) to compile your project, you should configure TypeScript to generate source maps, and use Sentry CLI to create the release and upload the generated source maps.

## 1. Generate Source Maps

First, configure the TypeScript compiler to output source maps:

```json {filename:tsconfig.json}
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "sourceMap": true,
    "inlineSources": true,

    // Set `sourceRoot` to  `/` to strip the build path prefix from
    // generated source code references. This allows Sentry to match source files
    // relative to your source root folder.
    "sourceRoot": "/"
  }
}
```

## 2. Update SDK Options

To be able to match Sentry errors with the correct release, you must provide a `release` property in the SDK options:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  // Make sure this value is identical to the name you give the release that you
  // create below using Sentry CLI
  release: "<release_name>",
});
```

## 3. Upload Source Maps Using Sentry CLI

<Note>

You can find installation instructions for Sentry CLI here: https://docs.sentry.io/product/cli/installation/

For more info on Sentry CLI configuration visit the [Sentry CLI configuration docs](/product/cli/configuration/).

</Note>

Make sure Sentry CLI is configured for your project. You can use a `.sentryclirc` file or environment variables:

<Note>

Visit the [auth token user settings page](https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/) to find your auth tokens.

</Note>

```ìni {filename:.sentryclirc}
[auth]
token=your-auth-token

[defaults]
org=___ORG_SLUG___
project=___PROJECT_SLUG___
```

```bash
export SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=your-auth-token
export SENTRY_ORG=___ORG_SLUG___
export SENTRY_PROJECT=___PROJECT_SLUG___
```

After configuring Sentry CLI and compiling your project with `tsc`, create a release with Sentry CLI:

```bash
sentry-cli releases new <release_name>
```

Next, upload your release artifacts (source files and source maps):

```bash
sentry-cli releases files <release_name> upload-sourcemaps /path/to/files
```

<Note>

You can verify that your upload was successful by navigating to **Releases -> [latest release] -> Source Maps (right sidebar)** on Sentry.

</Note>

At this point, the release is in a draft state (“_unreleased_”). Once all source maps have been uploaded and your app has been published successfully, finalize the release with the following command:

```bash
sentry-cli releases finalize <release_name>
```

For more information on how to configure releases via Sentry CLI, see our [Sentry CLI release management docs](/product/cli/releases/).
