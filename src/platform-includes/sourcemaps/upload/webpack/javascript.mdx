Sentry uses [releases](/product/releases/) to match the correct source maps to your events.
You can use the Sentry Webpack plugin to automatically create releases and upload source maps to Sentry when bundling your app.

## Installation

```shell {tabTitle:npm}
npm install --save-dev @sentry/webpack-plugin
```

```shell {tabTitle:Yarn}
yarn add --dev @sentry/webpack-plugin
```

## Configuration

Learn more about configuring the plugin in our [Sentry Webpack Plugin documentation](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-webpack-plugin).

Example:

<PlatformSection notSupported={["javascript.gatsby"]}>

```javascript {filename:webpack.config.js}
const SentryWebpackPlugin = require("@sentry/webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  // ... other config above ...

  devtool: "source-map", // Source map generation must be turned on
  plugins: [
    new SentryWebpackPlugin({
      org: "___ORG_SLUG___",
      project: "___PROJECT_SLUG___",

      // Specify the directory containing build artifacts
      include: "./dist",

      // Auth tokens can be obtained from https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/
      // and needs the `project:releases` and `org:read` scopes
      authToken: process.env.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN,

      // Optionally uncomment the line below to override automatic release name detection
      // release: process.env.RELEASE,
    }),
  ],
};
```

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["javascript.gatsby"]}>

```javascript {filename:gatsby-node.js}
const SentryWebpackPlugin = require("@sentry/webpack-plugin");

exports.onCreateWebpackConfig = ({ actions }) => {
  actions.setWebpackConfig({
    plugins: [
      new SentryWebpackPlugin({
        org: "___ORG_SLUG___",
        project: "___PROJECT_SLUG___",

        ignore: ["app-*", "polyfill-*", "framework-*", "webpack-runtime-*"],

        // Specify the directory containing build artifacts
        include: "public",

        // Auth tokens can be obtained from https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/
        // and needs the `project:releases` and `org:read` scopes
        authToken: process.env.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN,

        // Optionally uncomment the line below to override automatic release name detection
        // release: process.env.RELEASE,
      }),
    ],
  });
};
```

</PlatformSection>

<Note>

If you use [SourceMapDevToolPlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/source-map-dev-tool-plugin) for more fine-grained control of source map generation, turn off `noSources` so Sentry can display proper source code context in event stack traces.

</Note>

The Sentry Webpack plugin will automatically inject a release value into the SDK so you must either omit the `release` option from `Sentry.init` or make sure `Sentry.init`'s `release` option matches the plugin's `release` option exactly:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // When using the plugin, either remove the `release`` property here entirely or
  // make sure that the plugin's release option and the Sentry.init()'s release
  // option match exactly.
  // release: "my-example-release-1"
});
```
