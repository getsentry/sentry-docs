<Note>

This guide assumes you are using a Sentry SDK on version `7.47.0` or higher.

If you are on an older version and you want to upload source maps we recommend upgrading your SDK to the newest version.

</Note>

You can use the Sentry esbuild plugin to automatically create releases and upload source maps to Sentry when bundling your app.

## Install

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install @sentry/esbuild-plugin --save-dev
```

```bash {tabTitle:Yarn}
yarn add @sentry/esbuild-plugin --dev
```

## Configure

Learn more about configuring the plugin in our [Sentry esbuild Plugin documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/esbuild-plugin).

Example:

```javascript {filename:esbuild.config.js}
const { sentryEsbuildPlugin } = require("@sentry/esbuild-plugin");

require("esbuild").build({
  sourcemap: true, // Source map generation must be turned on
  plugins: [
    // Put the Sentry esbuild plugin after all other plugins
    sentryEsbuildPlugin({
      org: "___ORG_SLUG___",
      project: "___PROJECT_SLUG___",

      // Auth tokens can be obtained from https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/
      // and need `project:releases` and `org:read` scopes
      authToken: process.env.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN,
    }),
  ],
});
```
