<Note>

This guide assumes you are using a Sentry SDK on version `7.47.0` or higher.

If you are on an older version and you want to upload source maps we recommend upgrading your SDK to the newest version.

</Note>

You can use the Sentry Vite plugin to automatically create releases and upload source maps to Sentry when bundling your app.

## Installation

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install @sentry/vite-plugin --save-dev
```

```bash {tabTitle:Yarn}
yarn add @sentry/vite-plugin --dev
```

## Configuration

Learn more about configuring the plugin in our [Sentry Vite Plugin documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/vite-plugin).

Example:

```javascript {filename:vite.config.js}
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import { sentryVitePlugin } from "@sentry/vite-plugin";

export default defineConfig({
    build: {
      sourcemap: true, // Source map generation must be turned on
    },
    plugins: [
      // Put the Sentry vite plugin after all other plugins
      sentryVitePlugin({
        org: "___ORG_SLUG___",
        project: "___PROJECT_SLUG___",

        // Auth tokens can be obtained from https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/
        // and need `project:releases` and `org:read` scopes
        authToken: env.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN,
      }),
    ],
});
```
