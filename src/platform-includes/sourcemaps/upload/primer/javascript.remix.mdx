On release, call `yarn sentry-upload-sourcemaps` to upload source maps and create a release.

<Alert level="warning">

`sentry-upload-sourcemaps` requires either [`env` variables](/product/cli/configuration/#configuration-values) or a valid `.sentryclirc` file to pick up your project ID, organization ID, and token. You can create the `.sentryclirc` file with necessary configuration, as documented on this [page](/product/cli/configuration/).

</Alert>

To see more details on how to use the command, call `yarn sentry-upload-sourcemaps --help`.

For more advanced configuration, [use `sentry-cli` directly to upload source maps.](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cli).
