<Note>

This guide assumes you are using a Sentry SDK on version `7.47.0` or higher.

If you are on an older version and you want to upload source maps we recommend upgrading your SDK to the newest version.

</Note>

You can use the Sentry Rollup plugin to automatically create releases and upload source maps to Sentry when bundling your app.

## Automatic Setup

The easiest way to configure uploading source maps with rollup is by using the Sentry Wizard:

<Include name="sourcemaps-wizard-instructions.mdx" />

If you want to configure source maps upload with rollup manually, follow the steps below.

## Manual Setup

Install the Sentry Rollup plugin:

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install @sentry/rollup-plugin --save-dev
```

```bash {tabTitle:Yarn}
yarn add @sentry/rollup-plugin --dev
```

## Configuration

Learn more about configuring the plugin in our [Sentry Rollup Plugin documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/rollup-plugin).

Example:

```javascript {filename:rollup.config.js}
import { sentryRollupPlugin } from "@sentry/rollup-plugin";

export default {
  output: {
    sourcemap: true, // Source map generation must be turned on
  },
  plugins: [
    // Put the Sentry rollup plugin after all other plugins
    sentryRollupPlugin({
      org: "___ORG_SLUG___",
      project: "___PROJECT_SLUG___",

      // Auth tokens can be obtained from https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/
      // and need `project:releases` and `org:read` scopes
      authToken: process.env.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN,
    }),
  ],
};
```
