## Upload Source Maps Using [`sentry-cli`](/product/cli/)

When using [`sentry-cli`](/product/cli/) to upload source maps, you need to set up your build system to both create a release and upload the various source files corresponding to that release. For Sentry to demangle your stack traces, provide both:

- The deployed files (in other words, the results of your transpilation/minification/bundling process; for example, `app.min.js`)
- The corresponding source maps

If the source map files do not contain your original source code (`sourcesContent`), you must also provide the original source files. Sentry CLI will attempt to automatically embed the sources in your source maps if they are missing.

Sentry uses [releases](/product/releases/) to match the correct source maps to your events. To create a new release, run the following command (for example, during publishing):

```bash
sentry-cli releases new <release_name>
```

<Note>

The release name must be **unique within your organization** and match the `release` option in your SDK initialization code. Then, use the `upload-sourcemaps` command to scan a folder for source maps, process them, and upload them to Sentry.

</Note>

```bash
sentry-cli releases files <release_name> upload-sourcemaps /path/to/files
```

<Note>

You can find the artifacts uploaded to Sentry by navigating to **[Project] > Project Settings > Source Maps**.

</Note>

This command will upload all files ending in _.js_ and _.map_ to the specified release. If you wish to change these extensions – for example, to upload typescript sources – use the `--ext` option:

```bash
sentry-cli releases files <release_name> upload-sourcemaps --ext ts --ext map /path/to/files
```

Until now, the release is in a draft state (“_unreleased_”). Once all source maps have been uploaded, and your app has been published successfully, finalize the release with the following command:

```bash
sentry-cli releases finalize <release_name>
```

For convenience, you can pass the `--finalize` flag to the `new` command, which will immediately finalize the release.

It's not uncommon for a web application to be accessible at multiple origins. See our documentation on <PlatformLink to="/sourcemaps/troubleshooting_js/#multiple-origins">multiple origins</PlatformLink> to learn how to handle this.
