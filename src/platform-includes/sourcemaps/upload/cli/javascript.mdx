If you choose [`sentry-cli`](/product/cli/) as the method to upload your source files, we assume you already know how to generate source maps within your build tool chain.

Sentry uses [releases](/product/releases/) to match the correct uploaded source maps to your events. You can use `sentry-cli` to create releases and upload source maps to Sentry.

## 1. Update SDK Options

To be able to match Sentry errors with the correct release, you must provide a `release` property in the SDK options:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  // Make sure this value is identical to the name you give the release that you
  // create below using Sentry CLI
  release: "<release_name>",
});
```

## 2. Upload Source Maps Using Sentry CLI

<Note>

You can find installation instructions for Sentry CLI here: https://docs.sentry.io/product/cli/installation/

For more info on Sentry CLI configuration visit the [Sentry CLI configuration docs](/product/cli/configuration/).

</Note>

Make sure Sentry CLI is configured for your project. You can use a `.sentryclirc` file or environment variables:

<Note>

Visit the [auth token user settings page](https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/) to find your auth tokens.

</Note>

```ìni {filename:.sentryclirc}
[auth]
token=your-auth-token

[defaults]
org=___ORG_SLUG___
project=___PROJECT_SLUG___
```

```bash
export SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=your-auth-token
export SENTRY_ORG=___ORG_SLUG___
export SENTRY_PROJECT=___PROJECT_SLUG___
```

Then, create a release with Sentry CLI. The release name must be unique within your organization:

```bash
sentry-cli releases new <release_name>
```

Next, upload your release artifacts (source files and source maps):

```bash
sentry-cli releases files <release_name> upload-sourcemaps /path/to/files
```

<Note>

You can verify your uploaded artifacts by navigating to **Releases -> [latest release] -> Source Maps (right sidebar)** on Sentry.

</Note>

At this point, the release is in a draft state (“_unreleased_”). Once all source maps have been uploaded and your app has been published successfully, finalize the release with the following command:

```bash
sentry-cli releases finalize <release_name>
```

For more information on how to configure releases via Sentry CLI, see our [Sentry CLI release management docs](/product/cli/releases/).
