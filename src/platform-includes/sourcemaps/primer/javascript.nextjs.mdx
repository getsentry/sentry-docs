`@sentry/nextjs` will generate and upload source maps automatically, in order to enable errors to have readable stacktraces.

To upload source maps, the `@sentry/nextjs` SDK uses the [Sentry Webpack Plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/webpack-plugin) under the hood. See the [Manual Configuration](../manual-setup/#configure-source-maps) page and the Sentry [Webpack Plugin documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/webpack-plugin/v/1.20.1) for more details. If you are using Vercel, then you can also use the [Vercel integration](/product/integrations/deployment/vercel/) to upload source maps during deployments automatically.
