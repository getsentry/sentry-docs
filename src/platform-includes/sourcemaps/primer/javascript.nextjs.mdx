`@sentry/nextjs` will generate and upload source maps automatically, in order to enable errors to have readable stacktraces.

To upload source maps, the `@sentry/nextjs` SDK uses the [Sentry Webpack Plugin](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-webpack-plugin) under the hood. See the [Manual Configuration](../manual-setup/#configure-source-maps) page and the Sentry [Webpack Plugin documentation](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-webpack-plugin#cli-configuration) for more details.
