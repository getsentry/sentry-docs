`@sentry/sveltekit` will generate and upload source maps automatically, so that errors in Sentry will contain readable stack traces.

The SvelteKit SDK uses the [Sentry Vite Plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/vite-plugin) to upload source maps. See the [Manual Configuration](../manual-setup/#configure-source-maps-upload) page and the Sentry [Vite documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/vite-plugin) for more details.
