Sentry supports demangling of transpiled, minified, and bundled JavaScript using source maps, which are JSON files that contain information about how to map your deployed code back to its original source(s). This lets you view source code context obtained from stack traces in its original, untransformed form. This is particularly useful when debugging minified and/or transpiled code, since both of those processes make large enough changes to the code that it often becomes nearly unrecognizable in its final deployed form. Source maps also allow Sentry to show each line in the stack trace in context, by including additional lines of code on either side.
