For example, if you're using Webpack and Babel, and you have the following code in your `webpack.config.js`, you'll want to modify `exclude` so it doesn't block the SDK.

Before:

```javascript {filename:webpack.config.js}
module: {
  rules: [
    {
      test: /\.(js)$/,
      exclude: /node_modules/,
      use: ['babel-loader']
    }
  ]
},
```

After:

```javascript {filename:webpack.config.js}
module: {
  rules: [
    {
      test: /\.(js)$/,
      // Make sure to include all `@sentry` packages, not just the main SDK package
      exclude: filepath => filepath.includes("node_modules") && !filepath.includes("@sentry"),
      use: ['babel-loader']
    }
  ]
},
```

Though the above example is Webpack-specific, similar changes can be made to configuraton for Rollup, esbuild, and the like.
