## Job Monitoring

Use the Laravel integration to monitor and notify you if your [scheduled task](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/scheduling) is missed (or doesn't start when expected), if it fails due to a problem in the runtime (such as an error), or if it fails by exceeding its maximum runtime.

To set up, add the `sentryMonitor()` macro to your scheduled tasks defined in your `app/Console/Kernel.php` file:

```php {filename:app/Console/Kernel.php}
protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
{
    $schedule->command('emails:send')
        ->everyHour()
        ->sentryMonitor('<monitor-slug>'); // add this line
}
```
