## Job Monitoring

Use the Laravel integration to monitor and notify you if your job doesn't start when expected (missed), fails, or if it exceeded its maximum runtime (failed).

To setup, add the `sentryMonitor()` macro to your scheduled tasks defined in your `app/Console/Kernel.php` file:

```php {filename:app/Console/Kernel.php}
protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
{
    $schedule->command('emails:send')
        ->everyHour()
        ->sentryMonitor('<monitor-slug>'); // add this line
}
```
