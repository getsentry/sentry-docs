## Check-Ins (Recommended)

Check-in monitoring allows you to track a job's progress by completing two check-ins: one at the start of your job and another at the end of your job. This two-step process allows Sentry to notify you if your job didn't start when expected (missed) or if it exceeded its maximum runtime (failed).

```php
// ðŸŸ¡ Notify Sentry your job is running:
$event = Event::createCheckIn();
$checkIn = new CheckIn(
    monitorSlug: '<monitor-slug>',
    status: CheckInStatus::inProgress(),
);
$event->setCheckIn($checkIn);
SentrySdk::getCurrentHub()->captureEvent($event);

// Execute your scheduled task here...

// ðŸŸ¢ Notify Sentry your job has completed successfully:
$event = Event::createCheckIn();
$event->setCheckIn(new CheckIn(
    id: $checkIn->getId(),
    monitorSlug: '<monitor-slug>',
    status: CheckInStatus::ok(),
));
SentrySdk::getCurrentHub()->captureEvent($event);
```

If your job execution fails, you can do:

```php
// ðŸ”´ Notify Sentry your job has failed:
$event = Event::createCheckIn();
$event->setCheckIn(new CheckIn(
    id: $checkIn->getId(),
    monitorSlug: '<monitor-slug>',
    status: CheckInStatus::error(),
));
SentrySdk::getCurrentHub()->captureEvent($event);
```

## Heartbeat

Heartbeat monitoring notifies Sentry of a job's status through one check-in. This setup will only notify you if your job didn't start when expected (missed). If you need to track a job to see if it exceeded its maximum runtime (failed), use check-ins instead.

```php
// Execute your scheduled task...

// ðŸŸ¢ Notify Sentry your job completed successfully:
$event = Event::createCheckIn();
$checkIn = new CheckIn(
    monitorSlug: '<monitor-slug>',
    status: CheckInStatus::ok(),
);
$event->setCheckIn($checkIn);
SentrySdk::getCurrentHub()->captureEvent($event);
```

If your job execution fails, you can:

```php
// ðŸ”´ Notify Sentry your job has failed:
$event = Event::createCheckIn();
$event->setCheckIn(new CheckIn(
    id: $checkIn->getId(),
    monitorSlug: '<monitor-slug>',
    status: CheckInStatus::error(),
));
SentrySdk::getCurrentHub()->captureEvent($event);
```
