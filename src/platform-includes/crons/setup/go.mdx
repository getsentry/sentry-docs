## Check-Ins (Recommended)

Check-in monitoring allows you to track a job's progress by completing two check-ins: one at the start of your job and another at the end of your job. This two-step process allows Sentry to notify you if your job didn't start when expected (missed) or if it exceeded its maximum runtime (failed).

```go
// 🟡 Notify Sentry your job is running:
checkinId := sentry.CaptureCheckIn(
	&sentry.CheckIn{
		MonitorSlug: "<monitor-slug>",
		Status:      sentry.CheckInStatusInProgress,
	},
	nil,
)

// Execute your scheduled task here...

// 🟢 Notify Sentry your job has completed successfully:
sentry.CaptureCheckIn(
	&sentry.CheckIn{
		ID:          *checkinId,
		MonitorSlug: "<monitor-slug>",
		Status:      sentry.CheckInStatusOK,
	},
	nil,
)
```

If your job execution fails, you can notify Sentry about the failure:

```go
// 🔴 Notify Sentry your job has failed:
sentry.CaptureCheckIn(
	&sentry.CheckIn{
		ID:          *checkinId,
		MonitorSlug: "<monitor-slug>",
		Status:      sentry.CheckInStatusError,
	},
	nil,
)
```

## Heartbeat

Heartbeat monitoring notifies Sentry of a job's status through one check-in. This setup will only notify you if your job didn't start when expected (missed). If you need to track a job to see if it exceeded its maximum runtime (failed), use check-ins instead.

```go
// Execute your scheduled task...

// 🟢 Notify Sentry your job completed successfully:
sentry.CaptureCheckIn(
	&sentry.CheckIn{
		MonitorSlug: "<monitor-slug>",
		Status:      sentry.CheckInStatusOK,
	},
	nil,
)
```

If your job execution fails, you can:

```go
// 🔴 Notify Sentry your job has failed:
sentry.CaptureCheckIn(
	&sentry.CheckIn{
		MonitorSlug: "<monitor-slug>",
		Status:      sentry.CheckInStatusError,
	},
	nil,
)
```

## Upserting Cron Monitors

You can create and update your Monitors programmatically with code
rather than [creating and configuring them in Sentry.io](https://sentry.io/crons/create/).

```go
// Create a crontab schedule object (every 10 minutes)
monitorSchedule := sentry.CrontabSchedule("*/10 * * * *")

// Or create an interval schedule object (every 10 minutes)
monitorSchedule := sentry.IntervalSchedule(10, sentry.MonitorScheduleUnitMinute)
```

Supported units are:

- MonitorScheduleUnitMinute
- MonitorScheduleUnitHour
- MonitorScheduleUnitDay
- MonitorScheduleUnitWeek
- MonitorScheduleUnitMonth
- MonitorScheduleUnitYear

```go
// Create a monitor config object
monitorConfig := &sentry.MonitorConfig{
	Schedule:      monitorSchedule,
	MaxRuntime:    2,
	CheckInMargin: 1,
}

// 🟡 Notify Sentry your job is running:
checkinId := sentry.CaptureCheckIn(
	&sentry.CheckIn{
		MonitorSlug: "<monitor-slug>",
		Status:      sentry.CheckInStatusInProgress,
	},
	monitorConfig,
)

// Execute your scheduled task here...

// 🟢 Notify Sentry your job has completed successfully:
sentry.CaptureCheckIn(
	&sentry.CheckIn{
		MonitorSlug: "<monitor-slug>",
		Status:      sentry.CheckInStatusOK,
	},
	monitorConfig,
)
```
