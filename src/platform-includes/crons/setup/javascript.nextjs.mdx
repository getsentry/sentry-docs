Cron monitoring is only supported in Server and Edge runtimes for Next.js

## Automatic Check-Ins (Vercel Only)

If you are hosting your Next.js application on Vercel and you are using [Vercel's Cron Jobs feature](https://vercel.com/docs/cron-jobs), the Next.js SDK will automatically create Check-Ins for you. Instrumented cron jobs are decided at runtime by examining the `crons` field in your `vercel.json` file.

To opt out of this behaviour, set the `automaticVercelMonitors` option to `false` in your Sentry settings in `next.config.js`. See <PlatformLink to="/manual-setup/#opt-out-of-auto-instrumentation-of-vercel-cron-jobs">Manual Setup</PlatformLink> for more details.
