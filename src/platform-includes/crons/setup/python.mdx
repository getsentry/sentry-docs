## Job Monitoring

Use the Python SDK to monitor and notify you if your periodic task is missed (or doesn't start when expected), if it fails due to a problem in the runtime (such as an error), or if it fails by exceeding its maximum runtime.

<Alert level="info" title="Note on Celery">

If you're using **Celery Beat** to run your periodic tasks, have a look at our [Celery Beat Auto Discovery documentation](/platforms/python/guides/celery/crons/).

</Alert>

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.crons import monitor

# Add the @monitor decorator to your task
@monitor(monitor_slug='<monitor-slug>')
def tell_the_world(msg):
    # Scheduled task here...
    print(msg)

# monitor can also equivalently be used as a context manager, like so
def tell_the_world_contextmanager(msg):
    with monitor(monitor_slug='<monitor-slug>'):
        # Scheduled task here...
        print(msg)
```
