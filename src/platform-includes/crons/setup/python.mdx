## Job Monitoring

Use the Python SDK to monitor and notify you if your job is missed (or doesn't start when expected), if it fails due to a problem in the runtime (such as an error), or if it fails by exceeding its maximum runtime.

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.crons import monitor

# Add the @monitor decorator to your job
@monitor(monitor_slug='<monitor-slug>')
def tell_the_world(msg):
    # Scheduled task here...
    print(msg)
```
