## Job Monitoring

Standard job frameworks such as `ActiveJob` and `Sidekiq` with a `perform` method can use the `Sentry::Cron::MonitorCheckIns` mixin module to automatically capture check-ins.

```rb {tabTitle: ActiveJob}
class ExampleJob < ApplicationJob
  include Sentry::Cron::MonitorCheckIns

  sentry_monitor_check_ins

  def perform(*args)
    # do stuff
  end
end
```

```rb {tabTitle: Sidekiq}
class SidekiqJob
  include Sidekiq::Job
  include Sentry::Cron::MonitorCheckIns

  sentry_monitor_check_ins

  def perform(*args)
    # do stuff
  end
end
```

You can pass in optional attributes to `sentry_monitor_check_ins` as follows.

```rb
# slug defaults to the job class name
sentry_monitor_check_ins slug: 'custom_slug'

# define the monitor config with an interval
sentry_monitor_check_ins monitor_config: Sentry::Cron::MonitorConfig.from_interval(1, :minute)

# define the monitor config with a crontab
sentry_monitor_check_ins monitor_config: Sentry::Cron::MonitorConfig.from_crontab('5 * * * *')
```

## Manual Setup

### Check-Ins (Recommended)

Check-in monitoring allows you to track a job's progress by completing two check-ins: one at the start of your job and another at the end of your job. This two-step process allows Sentry to notify you if your job didn't start when expected (missed) or if it exceeded its maximum runtime (failed).

```ruby
check_in_id = Sentry.capture_check_in('<monitor-slug>', :in_progress)
# Execute your scheduled task here...
Sentry.capture_check_in('<monitor-slug>', :ok, check_in_id: check_in_id)
```

If your job execution fails, you can notify Sentry about the failure:

```ruby
Sentry.capture_check_in('<monitor-slug>', :error, check_in_id: check_in_id)
```

### Heartbeat

Heartbeat monitoring notifies Sentry of a job's status through one check-in. This setup will only notify you if your job didn't start when expected (missed). If you need to track a job to see if it exceeded its maximum runtime (failed), use check-ins instead.

```ruby
Sentry.capture_check_in('<monitor-slug>', :ok)
```

If your job execution fails, you can notify Sentry about the failure:

```ruby
Sentry.capture_check_in('<monitor-slug>', :error)
```
