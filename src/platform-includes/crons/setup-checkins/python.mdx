Use the Python SDK to monitor and notify you if your job doesn't start when expected (missed), fails, or if it exceeded its maximum runtime (failed).

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.crons import monitor

# Add the @monitor decorator to your job
@monitor(monitor_slug='<monitor-slug>')
def tell_the_world(msg):
    # Scheduled task here...
    print(msg)
```
