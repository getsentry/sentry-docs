To set the level out of scope, you can call `captureMessage()` per event:

```javascript
Sentry.captureMessage("this is a debug message", "debug");
```

Available levels are `"fatal"`, `"error"`, `"warning"`, `"log"`, `"info"`, and `"debug"`.

To set the level within scope, you can call `setLevel()`:

```javascript
Sentry.configureScope(function (scope) {
  scope.setLevel("warning");
});
```

or per event:

```javascript
Sentry.withScope(function (scope) {
  scope.setLevel("info");

  // The exception has the event level set by the scope (info).
  Sentry.captureException(new Error("custom error"));
});

// Outside of withScope, the Event level will have their previous value restored.
// The exception has the event level set (error).
Sentry.captureException(new Error("custom error 2"));
```
