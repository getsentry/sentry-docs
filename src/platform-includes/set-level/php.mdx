```php
app('sentry')->captureMessage("this is a debug message", \Sentry\Severity::debug());
```

Available levels are `"fatal"`, `"critical"`, `"error"`, `"warning"`, `"log"`, `"info"`, and `"debug"`.

To set the level within scope, you can call `setLevel()`:

```php
app('sentry')->configureScope(function (\Sentry\State\Scope $scope): void {
    $scope->setLevel(\Sentry\Severity::debug());
});
```

or per event:

```php
app('sentry')->withScope(function (\Sentry\State\Scope $scope): void {
   $scope->setLevel(\Sentry\Severity::info());
   
  // The exception has the event level set by the scope (info)
  \Sentry\captureMessage('This is now a warning!');
});

// Outside of withScope, the Event level will have their previous value restored.
// The exception has the event level set (error).
app('sentry')->captureException(new Error("custom error 2"));
```
