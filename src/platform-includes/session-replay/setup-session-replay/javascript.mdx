To set up the integration, add the following to your Sentry initialization. Several options are supported and passable via the integration constructor. See the [configuration sections](/platforms/javascript/session-replay/custom-instrumentation/) for more details.

```javascript
// import Sentry from your framework SDK (e.g. @sentry/react) instead of @sentry/browser 
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";

import { Replay } from "@sentry/replay";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // This sets the sample rate to be 100% which helps verifying your set up
  // but you'll likely want to lower this in production.
  // For example, for 25% sampling, use 0.25
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 1.0,

  // You can separately control the sample rate for sessions that experienced errors.
  // For example keeping it 100%, even in production
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,

  integrations: [
    new Replay({
      // Additional SDK configuration goes in here, for example:
      maskAllText: true,
      blockAllMedia: true
      // See below for all available options
    })
  ],
  // ...
});
```
