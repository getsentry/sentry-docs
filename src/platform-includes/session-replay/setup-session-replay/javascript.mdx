To set up the integration, add the following to your Sentry initialization. Several options are supported and passable via the integration constructor. See the [configuration sections](/platforms/javascript/session-replay/custom-instrumentation/) for more details.

```javascript {tabTitle: ESM}
// import Sentry from your framework SDK (e.g. @sentry/react) instead of @sentry/browser 
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";

import { Replay } from "@sentry/replay";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // This sets the sample rate to be 10%. You may want this to be 100% while
  // in development and sample at a lower rate in production
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,

  // If the entire session is not sampled, use the below sample rate to sample
  // sessions when an error occurs.
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,

  integrations: [
    new Replay({
      // Additional SDK configuration goes in here, for example:
      maskAllText: true,
      blockAllMedia: true
      // See below for all available options
    })
  ],
  // ...
});
```

```javascript {tabTitle: CDN}
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // This sets the sample rate to be 10%. You may want this to be 100% while
  // in development and sample at a lower rate in production
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,

  // If the entire session is not sampled, use the below sample rate to sample
  // sessions when an error occurs.
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,

  integrations: [
    new Sentry.Integrations.Replay({
      // Additional SDK configuration goes in here, for example:
      maskAllText: true,
      blockAllMedia: true
      // See below for all available options
    })
  ],
  // ...
});
```
