```javascript
On your client-side NextJS app, add:

import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // This sets the sample rate to be 10%. You may want this to be 100% while
  // in development and sample at a lower rate in production
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,

  // If the entire session is not sampled, use the below sample rate to sample
  // sessions when an error occurs.
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,

  integrations: [
    new Sentry.Replay({
      // Additional SDK configuration goes in here, for example:
      maskAllText: true,
      blockAllMedia: true,
    }),
  ],
});
```

With the settings above, session replays with errors are always captured.
You can verify that with the following:

```javascript
myUndefinedFunction();
```

### Lazy-loading Replay

Once you've added the integration, Replay will start automatically. If you don't want to start it immediately (lazy-load it), you can use `addIntegration`:

```js
Sentry.init({
  // Note, Replay is NOT instantiated below:
  integrations: [],
});

// Sometime later
const { getCurrentHub, Replay } = await import("@sentry/nextjs");
getCurrentHub().getClient().addIntegration(new Replay());
```
