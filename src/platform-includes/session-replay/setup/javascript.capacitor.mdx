To set up the integration, add the following to your Sentry initialization. Several options are supported and passable using the integration constructor. See the [configuration documentation](/javascript/guides/capacitor/session-replay/configuration/) for more details.

```javascript {tabTitle: ESM}
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/capacitor';
import { Replay } from "@sentry/replay";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // This sets the sample rate to be 10%. You may want this to be 100% while
  // in development and sample at a lower rate in production
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,

  // If the entire session is not sampled, use the below sample rate to sample
  // sessions when an error occurs.
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,

  integrations: [
    new Replay({
      // Additional SDK configuration goes in here, for example:
      maskAllText: true,
      blockAllMedia: true,
    }),
  ],
});
```

With the settings above, session replays with errors are always captured.
You can verify that with the following:

```javascript
myUndefinedFunction();
```
