Several options are supported and passable using the integration constructor. See the [configuration documentation](/platforms/javascript/guides/capacitor/session-replay/configuration/) for more details. To set up the integration, add the following to your Sentry initialization:

<Note>The minimal supported version of Sentry's SDK for Capacitor is 0.11.1.</Note>

```javascript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/capacitor';
import {Replay} from '@sentry/replay';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',

  // This sets the sample rate at 10%. You may want this to be 100% while
  // in development, then sample at a lower rate in production.
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,

  // If the entire session is not sampled, use the below sample rate to sample
  // sessions when an error occurs.
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,

  integrations: [
    new Replay({
      // Additional SDK configuration goes in here, for example:
      maskAllText: true,
      blockAllMedia: true,
    }),
  ],
});
```

Session replays with errors, will always be captured with the settings above.
Verify it with the following:

```javascript
myUndefinedFunction();
```
