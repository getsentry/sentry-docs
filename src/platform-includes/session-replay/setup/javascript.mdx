```javascript
// import Sentry from your framework SDK (e.g. @sentry/react) instead of @sentry/browser
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // This sets the sample rate to be 10%. You may want this to be 100% while
  // in development and sample at a lower rate in production
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,

  // If the entire session is not sampled, use the below sample rate to sample
  // sessions when an error occurs.
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,

  integrations: [
    Sentry.replayIntegration({
      // Additional SDK configuration goes in here, for example:
      maskAllText: true,
      blockAllMedia: true,
    }),
  ],
});
```

With the settings above, session replays with errors are always captured.
You can verify this by adding the following snippet anywhere in your code and running it:

```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
  throw new Error("Sentry Test Error");
});
```

### Lazy-loading Replay

Once you've added the integration, Replay will start automatically. If you don't want to start it immediately (lazy-load it), you can use `addIntegration`:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  // Note, Replay is NOT instantiated below:
  integrations: [],
});

// Sometime later
const { Replay } = await import("@sentry/browser");
Sentry.addIntegration(replayIntegration());
```
