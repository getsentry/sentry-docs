For the sentry-replay integration to work, you must have the [Sentry browser SDK package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/browser), or an equivalent framework SDK (for example, [@sentry/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/react)) installed. The minimum version required for the SDK is `7.27.0`. If you're on an older version of the SDK, please check the [migration document](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/master/MIGRATION.md).

Session Replay requires Node 12+, and browsers newer than IE11.
