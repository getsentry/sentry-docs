For the sentry-replay integration to work, you must have the [Sentry Capacitor SDK package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/capacitor) installed. The minimum version required for the SDK is `0.12.3`.
If you're on an older version of the SDK, please check the [troubleshooting
document to help on
migration](/platforms/javascript/guides/capacitor/troubleshooting/).
