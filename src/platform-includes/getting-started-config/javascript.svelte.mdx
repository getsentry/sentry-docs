To use the SDK, initialize it in your Svelte entry point before bootstrapping your app. In a typical Svelte project, that is your `main.js` or `main.ts` file.

```javascript {filename: main.js}
import "./app.css";
import App from "./App.svelte";

import * as Sentry from "@sentry/svelte";

// Initialize the Sentry SDK here
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    new Sentry.BrowserTracing({
      // Set `tracePropagationTargets` to control for which URLs distributed tracing should be enabled
      tracePropagationTargets: ["localhost", /^https:\/\/yourserver\.io\/api/],
    }),
    new Sentry.Replay(),
  ],

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for performance monitoring.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,

  // Capture Replay for 10% of all sessions,
  // plus for 100% of sessions with an error
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,
});

const app = new App({
  target: document.getElementById("app"),
});

export default app;
```

Once you've done this, the SDK will automatically capture unhandled errors and promise rejections, and monitor performance in the client. You can also [manually capture errors](/platforms/javascript/guides/svelte/usage).
