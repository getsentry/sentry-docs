### Initialize

To initialize the SDK, you need to call:

```javascript {filename:App.js}
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react-native';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for performance monitoring.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

Once this is done, all unhandled exceptions will be automatically captured by Sentry. You can also perform the following optional steps:

### Wrap Your App

Wrap your app with Sentry to automatically instrument it with [touch event tracking](/platforms/react-native/touchevents/) and [automatic performance monitoring](/platforms/react-native/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/):

```javascript {filename:App.js}
export default Sentry.wrap(App);
```

### Enable Performance Monitoring

Learn how to enable Sentry's [performance monitoring](/platforms/react-native/performance/) in your SDK to help you track your application performance, measuring metrics like throughput and latency.

### Ensure Promise Rejection Handling is Active

Due to an issue with React Native's dependencies, unhandled promise rejections might not be correctly caught by Sentry. If the rejection handling is not active, our SDK might issue a warning:

> WARN: Unhandled promise rejections might not be caught by Sentry. Read about how to fix this on our troubleshooting docs.
