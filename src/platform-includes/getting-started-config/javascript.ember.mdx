This snippet includes automatic instrumentation to monitor the performance of your application, which registers and configures the Tracing integration, including custom [Ember instrumentation](./configuration/ember-options/).

```javascript
import Application from '@ember/application';
import Resolver from 'ember-resolver';
import loadInitializers from 'ember-load-initializers';
import config from './config/environment';

import * as Sentry from '@sentry/ember';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for performance monitoring.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production,
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

export default class App extends Application {
  modulePrefix = config.modulePrefix;
  podModulePrefix = config.podModulePrefix;
  Resolver = Resolver;
}
```

<Note>

This SDK uses Ember configuration conventions to manage its automatic instrumentation and other Sentry options. This additional configuration can be found under <PlatformLink to="/configuration/ember-options/">Ember options</PlatformLink>.
