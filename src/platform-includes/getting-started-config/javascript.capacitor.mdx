Then forward the `init` method from the sibling Sentry SDK for the framework you use, such as Angular in this example:

```typescript {tabTitle: Angular} {filename: app.module.ts}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/capacitor";
import * as SentryAngular from "@sentry/angular";

Sentry.init(
  {
    dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

    // Set your release version, such as "getsentry@1.0.0"
    release: "my-project-name@<release-name>",
    // Set your dist version, such as "1"
    dist: "<dist>"
  },
  // Forward the init method from @sentry/angular
  SentryAngular.init
);

@NgModule({
  providers: [
    {
      provide: ErrorHandler,
      // Attach the Sentry ErrorHandler
      useValue: SentryAngular.createErrorHandler(),
    },
  ],
})
```

```javascript {tabTitle: Other Frameworks}
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/capacitor';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',

  // Set your release version, such as "getsentry@1.0.0"
  release: 'my-project-name@<release-name>',
  // Set your dist version, such as "1"
  dist: '<dist>',
});
```

You can also use the features available with the Sentry SDK for the framework you use, such as [Angular](/platforms/javascript/guides/angular/).

### Source Maps

You will need to upload source maps to make sense of the events you receive in Sentry.

For example, if you are using Capacitor with Ionic-Angular, upload your `www` folder on **every build** you release. The values for `<release_name>` and `<dist>` must match the values passed into `Sentry.init` for events to be deminified correctly.

```bash {tabTitle: Ionic}
sentry-cli releases files <release_name> upload-sourcemaps ./www --dist <dist>
```

Learn more about uploading [source maps](/platforms/javascript/guides/capacitor/sourcemaps/).

### Provide Native Debug Information (iOS)

To make stack-trace information for native crashes on iOS easier to understand, you need to provide debug information to Sentry. Debug information is provided by [uploading dSYM files](/platforms/javascript/guides/capacitor/dsym).
