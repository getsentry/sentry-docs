To initialize Sentry in your Vue application, add this to your `app.js`:

### Vue 2

```javascript
import Vue from "vue";
import Router from "vue-router";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/vue";

Vue.use(Router);

const router = new Router({
  // ...
});

Sentry.init({
  Vue,
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    new Sentry.BrowserTracing({
      routingInstrumentation: Sentry.vueRouterInstrumentation(router),
    }),
  ],
  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for performance monitoring.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

// ...

new Vue({
  router,
  render: h => h(App),
}).$mount("#app");
```

### Vue 3

```javascript
import { createApp } from "vue";
import { createRouter } from "vue-router";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/vue";

const app = createApp({
  // ...
});
const router = createRouter({
  // ...
});

Sentry.init({
  app,
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    new Sentry.BrowserTracing({
      routingInstrumentation: Sentry.vueRouterInstrumentation(router),
    }),
  ],
  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for performance monitoring.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

app.use(router);
app.mount("#app");
```

Additionally, Vue 3 allows you to use multiple apps with the same Sentry SDK instance, as well as add more apps dynamically after the SDK has been already initialized.

### Vue 3 - Multiple Apps

```javascript
const appOne = Vue.createApp(App);
const appTwo = Vue.createApp(App);
const appThree = Vue.createApp(App);

Sentry.init({
  app: [appOne, appTwo, appThree],
});
```

### Vue 3 - Manual Initialization

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/vue";

// ...
const app = createApp(App);

Sentry.init({
  app,
  // ...
});

const miscApp = createApp(MiscApp);
miscApp.mixin(Sentry.createTracingMixins({ trackComponents: true }));
Sentry.attachErrorHandler(miscApp);
```

The SDK accepts a few different configuration options that let you change its behavior:

- `attachProps` (defaults to `true`) - Includes all Vue components' props with the events.
- `logErrors` (defaults to `true`) - Decides whether SDK should call Vue's original `logError` function as well.
- `trackComponents` (defaults to `false`) - Track your app's components. Learn more about [component tracking](./features/component-tracking) and all its options.
