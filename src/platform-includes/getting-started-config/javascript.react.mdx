```javascript
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";
import { BrowserTracing } from "@sentry/tracing";
import App from "./App";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [new BrowserTracing()],

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));

// Can also use with React Concurrent Mode
// ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(<App />);
```

Once this is done, all unhandled exceptions are automatically captured by Sentry.

### Add Error Boundary

If you're using React 16 or above, you can use the [Error Boundary](features/error-boundary/) component to automatically send Javascript errors from inside a component tree to Sentry, and set a fallback UI.

### Set Up React Router

The React Router integration is designed to work with our tracing package. Learn more about set up for our [React Router Integration](configuration/integrations/react-router/).

### Apply Redux

To apply Sentry to Redux, learn more about the [Redux Integration](configuration/integrations/redux/) and its options.
