```javascript
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import { createBrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";
import React from "react";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";
import App from "./App";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    new Sentry.BrowserTracing({
      // See docs for support of different versions of variation of react router
      // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/react/configuration/integrations/react-router/
      routingInstrumentation: Sentry.reactRouterV6Instrumentation(
        React.useEffect,
        useLocation,
        useNavigationType,
        createRoutesFromChildren,
        matchRoutes
      ),
    }),
    new Sentry.Replay()
  ],

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for performance monitoring.
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,

  // Set `tracePropagationTargets` to control for which URLs distributed tracing should be enabled
  tracePropagationTargets: ["localhost", /^https:\/\/yourserver\.io\/api/],

  // Capture Replay for 10% of all sessions,
  // plus for 100% of sessions with an error
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,
});

const container = document.getElementById(“app”);
const root = createRoot(container);
root.render(<App />);
```

Once this is done, all unhandled exceptions are automatically captured by Sentry.

### Add Error Boundary

If you're using React 16 or above, you can use the [Error Boundary](features/error-boundary/) component to automatically send Javascript errors from inside a component tree to Sentry, and set a fallback UI.

### Set Up React Router

The React Router integration is designed to work with our tracing package. Learn more about set up for our [React Router Integration](configuration/integrations/react-router/).

### Apply Redux

To apply Sentry to Redux, learn more about the [Redux Integration](configuration/integrations/redux/) and its options.
