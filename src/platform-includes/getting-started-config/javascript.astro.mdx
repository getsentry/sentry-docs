Get started by adding your DSN to your Astro config file:

<SignInNote />

```javascript {filename:astro.config.mjs}
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
import sentry from "@sentry/astro";

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    sentry({
      dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
      sourceMapsUploadOptions: {
        project: "___PROJECT_SLUG___",
        authToken: process.env.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN,
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

Once you've added your `dsn`, the SDK will automatically capture and send errors and performance events to Sentry.
