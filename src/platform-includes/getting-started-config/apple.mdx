You should also initialize the SDK as soon as possible, such as in your AppDelegate `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry // Make sure you import Sentry

// ....

func application(_ application: UIApplication,
    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {

    SentrySDK.start { options in
        options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
        options.debug = true // Enabled debug when first installing is always helpful
    }

    return true
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {

    [SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
        options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";
        options.debug = YES; // Enabled debug when first installing is always helpful
    }];

    return YES;
}
```

When using SwiftUI and your app doesn't implement an app delegate, initialize the SDK within the [App conformer's initializer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/app/main()):

```swift
import Sentry

@main
struct SwiftUIApp: App {
    init() {
        SentrySDK.start { options in
            options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
            options.debug = true // Enabled debug when first installing is always helpful
        }
    }
}
```
<!-- You can't write SwiftUI in Objective-C. Therefore no code sample. -->

## Provide Debug Information {#debug-symbols}

Before capturing crashes, you need to provide debug information to Sentry. Debug information is provided by uploading dSYM files using one of two methods, dependent on your setup:

- [With Bitcode](dsym/#dsym-with-bitcode)
- [Without Bitcode](dsym/#dsym-without-bitcode)
