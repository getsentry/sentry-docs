You should also initialize the SDK as soon as possible, such as in your AppDelegate `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry // Make sure you import Sentry

// ....

func application(_ application: UIApplication,
    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {

    SentrySDK.start { options in
        options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
        options.debug = true // Enabled debug when first installing is always helpful
    }

    return true
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {

    [SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
        options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";
        options.debug = YES; // Enabled debug when first installing is always helpful
    }];

    return YES;
}
```

When using SwiftUI and your app doesn't implement an app delegate, initialize the SDK within the [App conformer's initializer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/app/main()):

```swift
import Sentry

@main
struct SwiftUIApp: App {
    init() {
        SentrySDK.start { options in
            options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
            options.debug = true // Enabled debug when first installing is always helpful
        }
    }
}
```
<!-- You can't write SwiftUI in Objective-C. Therefore no code sample. -->

## Experimental features

> Want to play with some new features? Try out our experimental features for [file I/O](/platforms/apple/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#file-io-instrumentation), [Core Data](/platforms/apple/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#core-data-instrumentation), [User Interaction Instrumentation](/platforms/apple/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#user-interaction-instrumentation), [Screenshots](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/apple/guides/ios/enriching-events/screenshots/). Experimental features are still a work-in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.

> Let us know if you have feedback through [GitHub issues](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/issues).

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    // ...

    // Enable all experimental features
    options.enablePreWarmedAppStartTracing = true
    options.attachScreenshot = true
    options.attachViewHierarchy = true
    options.enableMetricKit = true
}
```
```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    // ...

    // Enable all experimental features
    options.enablePreWarmedAppStartTracing = YES;
    options.attachScreenshot = YES;
    options.attachViewHierarchy = YES;
    options.enableMetricKit = YES;
}];
```

## Use Sentry with SwiftUI

If you want to find out the performance of your Views in a SwiftUI project, [try the SentrySwiftUI library](/platforms/apple/performance/instrumentation/swiftui-instrumentation).

## Provide Debug Information {#debug-symbols}

To capture crashes, you need to provide debug information to Sentry. You can also use our source context feature to display code snippets next to the event stack traces by enabling the `include-sources` option when uploading your debug information files. Debug information is provided by <PlatformLink to="/dsym">uploading dSYM files</PlatformLink>.
