Though it's possible to <PlatformLink to="/manual-setup/">configure everything manually</PlatformLink>, we have a wizard that will automate the initial steps. To use the wizard, run the following command from the root level of your project:

```bash
npx @sentry/wizard -i nextjs
```

You'll be prompted to log in to Sentry. The wizard will then automatically add these configuration files to your project:

- create `sentry.client.config.js` and `sentry.server.config.js` with the default `Sentry.init`
- create `next.config.js` with the default configuration
- create `sentry.properties` with configuration for `sentry-cli` (which is used when automatically uploading source maps)
- create `.sentryclirc` with the auth token for `sentry-cli` (which is automatically added to the `.gitignore`)

See <PlatformLink to="/manual-setup/">manual configuration</PlatformLink> for examples of the files created by the wizard. If any of these files already exists, it will be created with a leading underscore and you will need to merge it with the existing file manually.

To complete your configuration, add <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/">options</PlatformLink> to your two `Sentry.init()` calls (in `sentry.client.config.js` and `sentry.server.config.js`, respectively). In those two files you can also set context data - data about the <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/identify-user/">user</PlatformLink>, for example, or <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/tags/">tags</PlatformLink>, or even <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/context/">arbitrary data</PlatformLink> - which will be added to every event sent to Sentry.

Once you're set up, the SDK will automatically capture unhandled errors and promise rejections, and monitor performance in the client. You can also <PlatformLink to="/usage/">manually capture errors</PlatformLink>.

By default, the SDK sets the environment for events to `process.env.NODE_ENV`, although you can [set your own](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/configuration/environments/).
