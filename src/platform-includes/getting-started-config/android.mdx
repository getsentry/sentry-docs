Additional options can be found <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/">on our dedicated options page</PlatformLink>.

Here you can also set context data - data about the <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/identify-user/">user</PlatformLink>, for example, or <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/tags/">tags</PlatformLink>, or even <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/context/">arbitrary data</PlatformLink> - which will be added to every event sent to Sentry.
