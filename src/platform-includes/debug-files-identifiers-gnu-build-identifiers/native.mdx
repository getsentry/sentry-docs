## GNU Build Identifiers

For ELF files on Linux, Sentry uses the GNU build identifier to compute the
debug identifier. All recent compilers and linkers support the emission of build
IDs, but sometimes they might require additional configuration. `gcc` does this
by default, for `clang` use one of the following flags:

- `--build-id=uuid` for a fast but non-reproducible random identifier.
- `--build-id=sha1` for a slower but reproducible identifier generated by
  hashing the first page of the code section.

_The identifier needs to be present and identical in the binary as well
as stripped debug information files._ If the ID is missing for some reason,
upload the files before stripping so that `sentry-cli` can compute a stable
identifier from the unstripped file.
