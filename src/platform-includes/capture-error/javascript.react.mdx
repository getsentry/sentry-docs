By including and configuring Sentry, our React SDK automatically attaches global handlers to _capture_ uncaught exceptions and unhandled promise rejections, as described in the official ECMAScript 6 standard. You can disable this default behavior by changing the `onunhandledrejection` option to `false` in your GlobalHandlers integration and manually hook into each event handler, then call `Sentry.captureException` or `Sentry.captureMessage` directly.

You can pass an `Error` object to `captureException()` to get it captured as event. It's also possible to pass non-`Error` objects and strings, but be aware that the resulting events in Sentry may be missing a stack trace.

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";

try {
  aFunctionThatMightFail();
} catch (err) {
  Sentry.captureException(err);
}
```

Sentry calls like `captureException` or `captureMessage` are side effects, so they should be wrapped in a `useEffect` hook to avoid triggering them on every render.

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";
import { useEffect } from "react";

function App() {
  const [info, error] = useQuery("/api/info");
  useEffect(() => {
    if (error) {
      Sentry.captureException(error);
    }
  }, [error]);

  // ...
}
```
