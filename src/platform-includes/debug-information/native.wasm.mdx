For WASM, you need to provide both the debug information and the original code
in the same debug information file. To do this, we provide a custom
tool called [wasm-split](https://github.com/getsentry/symbolicator/tree/master/crates/wasm-split)
that can do the splitting for you:

```shell
wasm-split /path/to/file.wasm -d /path/to/file.debug.wasm --strip
```

This command modifies the `file.wasm` in place to add the `build_id`, then removes all
debug information. The debug information is put in a `file.debug.wasm` which
then needs to be uploaded to Sentry.
