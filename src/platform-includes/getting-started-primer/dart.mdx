<Note>

Sentry's Dart SDK enables automatic reporting of errors, messages, and exceptions. The SDK is available on GitHub [`sentry-dart`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dart/). For Flutter apps, refer to [our Flutter documentation](/platforms/flutter) instead.

- [Attachments](/platforms/dart/enriching-events/attachments/) enrich your event by storing additional files, such as config or log files.
