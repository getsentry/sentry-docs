<Note>

Sentry's Android SDK reports an error automatically whenever a thrown exception goes uncaught in your application causing the application to crash.

The SDK builds a crash report that persists to disk and tries to send the report right after the crash. Since the environment may be unstable at the crash time, the report is guaranteed to send once the application is started again. This process for sending a report is true if there is a fatal error in your native code as well as for the NDK. In addition, the NDK is not only catching unhandled exceptions but is also set as a signal handler to react to signals from the OS.

**Features:**

- The Native Development Kit (NDK), the set of tools that that allows you to use C and C++ code with Android, is packed with the SDK.
- Events [enriched](/platforms/android/enriching-events/context/) with device data
- Offline caching when a device is offline; we send a report once the application is restarted
- [Breadcrumbs automatically](/platforms/android/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/#automatic-breadcrumbs) captured for:
  - Android activity lifecycle events
  - Application lifecycle events (lifecycle of the application process)
  - System events (low battery, low storage space, airplane mode started, shutdown, changes of the configuration, and so forth)
  - App. component callbacks
  - User Interactions (view click, scroll, swipe, etc.)
  - Android fragment lifecycle events with [Fragment Integration](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/fragment/)
  - OkHttp requests with [OkHttp Integration](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/okhttp/)
  - Apollo requests with [Apollo Integration](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/apollo/)
  - Timber logs with [Timber Integration](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/timber/)
  - Navigation destination changes with [Navigation Integration](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/navigation/)
- [Release health](/product/releases/health/) tracks crash free users and sessions
- [Attachments](/platforms/android/enriching-events/attachments/) enrich your event by storing additional files, such as config or log files.
- [User Feedback](/platforms/android/enriching-events/user-feedback/) provides the ability to collect user information when an event occurs.
- [Performance Monitoring](/product/performance/) creates transactions for:
    - Android activity transactions
    - User interaction transactions (view click, scroll, swipe, and so on)
    - Navigation transactions with [Navigation Integration](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/navigation/)
    - Android fragment spans with [Fragment Integration](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/fragment/)
    - [Cold and warm app start](/platforms/android/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#app-start-instrumentation)
    - [Slow and frozen frames](/platforms/android/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#slow-and-frozen-frames)
    - OkHttp request spans with [OkHttp Integration](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/okhttp/)
    - SQLite and Room query spans with [Room and SQLite Integration](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/room-and-sqlite/)
    - File I/O spans with [File I/O Integration](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/file-io/)
    - Apollo request spans with [Apollo Integration](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/apollo/)
    - Distributed tracing through [OkHttp](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/okhttp/) and [Apollo](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/apollo/) integrations
- [Application Not Responding (ANR)](/platforms/android/configuration/app-not-respond/) reported if the application is blocked for more than five seconds
- [HTTP Client Errors](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/okhttp/#http-client-errors)
- [Screenshot attachments for errors](/platforms/android/enriching-events/screenshots/)
- [View Hierarchy attachments for errors](/platforms/android/enriching-events/viewhierarchy/)
- Code samples provided in both Kotlin and Java as the Android SDK uses both languages
- We provide a [sample application](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/tree/master/sentry-samples/sentry-samples-android) for our Android users
- Our [video tutorial](/platforms/android/android-video/) visually demonstrates how to set up our SDK
