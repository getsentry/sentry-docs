Configure Sentry with Unreal Engine.

<Alert level="warning" title="Warning">

This SDK is a preview that packages Sentry's native SDKs into an Unreal Engine plugin. Alternatively, the stable Crash Reporter tool provided by Epic Games can be used in order to capture and alert of errors from your game.

**Features:**

- Native support for automatic crash error tracking for
  - Android by using the [Android SDK](/platforms/android/) to support Java, Kotlin, C and C++
  - iOS by using the [iOS SDK](/platforms/apple/guides/ios/) to support Objective-C, Swift, C and C++
  - Windows and Linux by using the [Native SDK](/platforms/native/) to support C and C++ with minidumps
  - macOS by using the [macOS SDK](/platforms/apple/guides/macos/) to support Objective-C, Swift, C and C++
- Compatible with Unreal Engine 5
- [Crash Reporter Client](/platforms/unreal/setup-crashreporter/) provided along with Unreal Engine

<Alert level="warning">

[Crash Reporter Client](/platforms/unreal/setup-crashreporter/) has to be configured in order to capture crashes on Windows automatically. This step isn't required starting with UE 5.2 because the engine provides an API, which allows you to switch between default and third-party crash-handling solutions.
