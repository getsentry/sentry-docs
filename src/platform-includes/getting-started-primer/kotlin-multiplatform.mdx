Sentry's Kotlin Multiplatform SDK builds on top of multiple Sentry SDKs, allowing developers to use the same codebase and share code between platforms while being able to integrate Sentry's features into their applications. Installing this SDK will enable native crash reporting and automatic breadcrumbs for app lifecycle and UI events.
