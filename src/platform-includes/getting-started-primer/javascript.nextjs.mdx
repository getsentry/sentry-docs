Sentry's Next.js SDK enables automatic reporting of errors and performance data.

Features:

- Automatic [Error Tracking](/product/issues/) with source maps for both JavaScript and TypeScript
- Events [enriched](/platforms/javascript/enriching-events/context/) with device data
- [Breadcrumbs](/platforms/javascript/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/) created for outgoing HTTP request with XHR and Fetch, and console logs
- [Release health](/product/releases/health/) for tracking crash-free users and sessions
- Automatic [Performance Monitoring](/product/performance/) for both the client and server
- Errors and Performance support for [Middleware](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-middleware) and [Edge routes](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions) in Vercel's edge runtime. Due to complexities with the runtime, some features of errors like stack traces may not not be as expected. Requires <code>sentry.edge.config.js</code>, more info [here](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/manual-setup/#create-initialization-config-files)

<Note>

The minimum Next.js supported version is `10.0.8`. While Next.js version 13 is itself supported, support for beta features like the Next.js app router are work-in-progress. In particular, building with Turbopack will currently cause the Sentry SDK not to be included in your app.

<Note>

If you're using a [custom server](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-server), not all SDK features may be supported.
