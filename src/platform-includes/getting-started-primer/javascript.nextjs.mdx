<Note>

Sentry's Next.js SDK enables automatic reporting of errors and exceptions.

</Note>

The minimum Next.js supported version is `10.0.8`. While Next.js version 13 is itself supported, the new features it introduces are not yet. In particular, building with Turbopack will currently cause the Sentry SDK not to be included in your app.

Features:

- Automatic [Error Tracking](/product/issues/) with source maps for both JavaScript and TypeScript
- Events [enriched](/platforms/javascript/enriching-events/context/) with device data
- [Breadcrumbs](/platforms/javascript/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/) created for outgoing HTTP request with XHR and Fetch, and console logs
- [Release health](/product/releases/health/) for tracking crash-free users and sessions
- Automatic [Performance Monitoring](/product/performance/) for both the client and server, from version `6.5.0`
- Errors and Performance support for [Middleware](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-middleware) and [Edge routes](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions) in Vercel's edge runtime. Due to complexities with the runtime, some features of errors like stacktraces may not not be as expected. Requires <code>sentry.edge.config.js</code>, more info [here](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/manual-setup/#create-initialization-config-files)


Under the hood the SDK relies on our [React SDK](/platforms/javascript/guides/react/) on the frontend and [Node SDK](/platforms/node) on the backend, which makes all features available in those SDKs also available in this SDK.
Using a [custom server](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-server) is currently not supported.
