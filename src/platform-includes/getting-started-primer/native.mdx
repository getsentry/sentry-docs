The Sentry Native SDK is intended for C and C++. However, since it builds as a dynamic library and exposes C-bindings, it can be used by any language that supports interoperability with C, such as the Foreign Function Interface (FFI).

Sentry also offers higher-level SDKs for platforms with built-in support for native crashes:

- [_Android_](/platforms/android/)
- [_Apple (Cocoa)_](/platforms/apple/)
- [_Electron_](/platforms/electron/)
