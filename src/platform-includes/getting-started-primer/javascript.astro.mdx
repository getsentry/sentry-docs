Sentry's Astro SDK enables automatic reporting of errors and performance data.

<Alert>

The Astro SDK is in **Beta** and might still contain bugs. We recognize the irony.
Please report any issues you encounter in our [Github Repository](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/new/choose).

</Alert>

## Compatibility

The minimum supported Astro version is `3.0.0`.
This SDK currently only works on Node runtimes.
Non-Node runtimes, like Vercel's Edge runtime or Cloudflare Pages, are currently not supported.
