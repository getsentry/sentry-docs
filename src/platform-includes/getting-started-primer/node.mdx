Sentry's Node SDK enables automatic reporting of errors, exceptions, and transactions.

Our Node SDK supports all recent versions, and integrates well with a variety of popular frameworks and packages. It gives developers the ability to see Node source code at each frame instead and get proper asynchronous context tracking in a way that fits Node’s concurrency model.

If you are using our previous Node SDK, you can access the <Link rel={`nofollow`} to={`/platforms/node/legacy-sdk/`}>legacy SDK documentation</Link>, until further notice.
