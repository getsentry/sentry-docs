**Features:**

- Multiple types of errors are captured, including:
  - Mach exceptions
  - Fatal signals
  - Unhandled exceptions
  - C++ exceptions
  - Objective-C exceptions
  - Error messages of fatalError, assert, and precondition
  - Start-up crashes. The SDK init waits synchronously for up to 5 seconds to flush out events if the app crashes within 2 seconds after the SDK init.
- Events [enriched](/platforms/apple/enriching-events/context/) with device data
- Offline caching when a device is unable to connect; we send a report once we receive another event
- [Breadcrumbs automatically](/platforms/apple/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/#automatic-breadcrumbs) captured for
  - Application lifecycle events (`didBecomeActive`, `didEnterBackground`)
  - Touch events
  - System events (battery level or state changed, memory warnings, device orientation changed, keyboard did show and did hide, screenshot taken)
  - Outgoing HTTP requests
  <!-- When adding an auto breadcrumb item here please also update /platform-includes/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/automatic-breadcrumbs/apple.mdx -->
- [Release health](/product/releases/health/) tracks crash free users and sessions
- [Attachments](/platforms/apple/enriching-events/attachments/) enrich your event by storing additional files, such as config or log files
- [User Feedback](/platforms/apple/enriching-events/user-feedback/) provides the ability to collect user information when an event occurs
- [Source Context](/platforms/apple/data-management/debug-files/source-context/) shows snippets of code around the location of stack frames
