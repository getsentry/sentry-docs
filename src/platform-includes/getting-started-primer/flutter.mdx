<Note>

Sentry's Flutter SDK enables automatic reporting of errors, messages, and exceptions. The SDK is available on GitHub [`sentry-dart`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dart/).

</Note>

Features:

- Automatic native crash error tracking (using both [Android](/platforms/android/) and [iOS/macOS](/platforms/apple/)), including
  - Java, Kotlin, C, and C++ code for Android
  - ObjC, Swift, and C for iOS and macOS
  - Flutter and Android encapsulated exceptions (PlatformException)
- Offline storage of events
  - Android: Offline caching when a device is offline; we send a report once the application is restarted
  - iOS: Offline caching when a device is unable to connect; we send a report once we receive another event
- Events [enriched](/platforms/flutter/enriching-events/context/) with device data
- [Source Context](/platforms/flutter/data-management/debug-files/source-context/) show snippets of code around the location of stack frames
- Breadcrumbs automatically captured:
  - by the [Dart SDK](/platforms/dart/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/#automatic-breadcrumbs)
  - by the [Flutter SDK](/platforms/flutter/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/#automatic-breadcrumbs)
  - via the Native SDKs [Automatic Breadcrumbs for Android](/platforms/android/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/#automatic-breadcrumbs) and [Automatic Breadcrumbs for iOS](/platforms/apple/configuration/integrations/default/#sentryautobreadcrumbtrackingintegration)
  - by the [Logging Integration](/platforms/dart/configuration/integrations/logging)
  - by the [Dio Integration](/platforms/dart/configuration/integrations/dio/)
  - by the [User Interaction Instrumentation](/platforms/flutter/integrations/user-interaction-instrumentation/)
- [Release health](/product/releases/health/) tracks crash free users and sessions
- [Attachments](/platforms/flutter/enriching-events/attachments/) enrich your event by storing additional files, such as config or log files.
- [User Feedback](/platforms/flutter/enriching-events/user-feedback/) provides the ability to collect user information when an event occurs.
- [Performance Monitoring](/product/performance/) creates transactions for:
  - [Routing Instrumentation](/platforms/flutter/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#routing-instrumentation)
  - [User Interaction Instrumentation](/platforms/flutter/integrations/user-interaction-instrumentation/)
  - [HTTP requests](/platforms/flutter/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#httpclient-library-instrumentation)
  - [Dio HTTP library](/platforms/dart/configuration/integrations/dio/#performance-monitoring-for-http-requests)
  - [Cold and warm app start](/platforms/flutter/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#app-start-instrumentation)
  - [Slow and frozen frames](/platforms/flutter/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#slow-and-frozen-frames)
  - [AssetBundle Instrumentation](/platforms/flutter/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#assetbundle-instrumentation)
  - [File I/O Integration](/platforms/dart/configuration/integrations/file/)
  - [sqflite Database Instrumentation](/platforms/flutter/integrations/sqflite-instrumentation/)
- [Logging Integration](/platforms/dart/configuration/integrations/logging)
- [Screenshot attachments for errors](/platforms/flutter/enriching-events/screenshots/)
- [View Hierarchy attachments for errors](/platforms/flutter/enriching-events/viewhierarchy/)
- Limited support for Flutter Web, Windows, and Linux
- Under the hood, the SDK relies on the [Dart SDK](/platforms/dart/), version `2.17.0` and up, and the Flutter SDK, version `3.0.0` and up.
