Our Unity SDK builds on top of the [.NET SDK](/platforms/dotnet/) and extends it with Unity specific features. It gives developers helpful hints for where and why an error or performance issue might have occurred.

**Additional Features:**

- Supports C# errors on multiple platforms, including: Android, iOS, macOS, Linux, Windows, and WebGL
- Line numbers for C# [exceptions in IL2CPP builds](/platforms/unity/configuration/il2cpp/).
- [Native support](/platforms/unity/native-support/) for automatic crash error tracking for
  - Android by using the [Android SDK](/platforms/android/) to support Java, Kotlin, C and C++
  - iOS by using the [iOS SDK](/platforms/apple/guides/ios/) to support Objective-C, Swift, C and C++
  - Windows and Linux by using the [Native SDK](/platforms/native/) to support C and C++ with minidumps
  - macOS by using the [macOS SDK](/platforms/apple/guides/macos/) to support Objective-C, Swift, C and C++
- [Screenshot attachments](/platforms/unity/enriching-events/screenshots/) for errors
- [Offline caching](/platforms/unity/configuration/options/#cache-directory-path) stores event data to disk in case the device is not online
- [Release health](/platforms/unity/configuration/releases/) to keep track of crash free users and sessions
- [Breadcrumbs automatically](/platforms/unity/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/#automatic-breadcrumbs) captured for
  - Unity's `Debug.Log` and `Debug.LogWarning`
  - Scene load, unload, active change
- [Event debouncing](/platforms/unity/configuration/event-debouncing/) to handle high amounts of log output i.e. during `Update`
