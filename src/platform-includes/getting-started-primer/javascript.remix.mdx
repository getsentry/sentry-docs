<Note>

Sentry's Remix SDK enables automatic reporting of errors and exceptions, as well as the performance metrics for both client and server side operations.

</Note>

Sentry's Remix SDK relies on our [React SDK](/platforms/javascript/guides/react/) for the frontend and [Node SDK](/platforms/node) for the backend. That means all features available in those SDKs are also available in this SDK.

<Alert title='Non-Node Support' level='warning'>

Sentry's Remix SDK does not officially support adapters that use non-Node runtimes, such as Cloudflare Workers.
