<Note>

Sentry's Remix SDK enables automatic reporting of errors and exceptions, as well as the performance metrics for both client and server side operations.

</Note>

Under the hood, Remix SDK relies on our [React SDK](/platforms/javascript/guides/react/) on the frontend and [Node SDK](/platforms/node) on the backend, which makes all features available in those SDKs also available in this SDK.

<Alert title='Non-Node Support' level='warning'>

Sentry's Remix SDK does not officially support adapters that use non-Node runtimes, such as Cloudflare Workers.
