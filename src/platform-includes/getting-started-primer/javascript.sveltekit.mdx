Sentry's SvelteKit SDK enables automatic reporting of errors and performance data.

<Note>

The minimum supported **SvelteKit version is `1.0.0`**. This SDK works best with **Vite 4.2** and newer.
Older Vite versions might not generate source maps correctly.

</Note>

<Note>

The SvelteKit SDK is designed to work with SvelteKit's [Node adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-node).
Other adapters may work but aren't currently supported.
We're looking into extending first-class support to [more adapters](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) in the future.
