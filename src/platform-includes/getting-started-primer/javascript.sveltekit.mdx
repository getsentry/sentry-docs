Sentry's SvelteKit SDK enables automatic reporting of errors and performance data.

## Compatibility

The minimum supported **SvelteKit version is `1.0.0`**. This SDK works best with **Vite 4.2** and newer.
Older Vite versions might not generate source maps correctly.

<Note>

The SvelteKit SDK is designed to work out of the box with the following SvelteKit adapters:

- [Adapter-auto](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-auto) - for Vercel; other platforms might work but we don't guarantee compatibility at this time.
- [Adapter-vercel](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-vercel) - only for Node (Lambda) runtimes, not yet Vercel's edge runtime.
- [Adapter-node](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-node).

Other adapters may work but aren't currently supported.
We're looking into extending first-class support to [more adapters](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) in the future.

The SvelteKit SDK does not yet work with non-node server runtimes, such as Vercel's edge runtime or Cloudflare Workers.
