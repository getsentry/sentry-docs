The Sentry .NET SDK supports all recent versions of the .NET platform, and integrates well with a variety of popular frameworks and packages in the ecosystem. You can use it with applications written in C#, VB.NET, F#, and other .NET programming languages. It gives developers helpful hints for where and why an error or performance issue might have occurred.
