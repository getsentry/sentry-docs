## Retrieve a Transaction

In cases where you want to attach Spans to an already ongoing Transaction you can use `Sentry.get_current_scope.get_transaction`. This property will return a `Transaction` in case there is a running Transaction otherwise it returns `None`.

```ruby
transaction = Sentry.get_current_scope.get_transaction || Sentry.start_transaction(name: "task")

span = transaction.start_child(op: "operation")
# perform the operation
```

## Retrieve the Current Span

Started spans are stored in the scope, and can be fetched off the scope:

```ruby
span = Sentry.get_current_scope.get_span
```
