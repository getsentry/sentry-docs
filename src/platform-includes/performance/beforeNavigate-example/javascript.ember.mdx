One common use case is parameterizing transaction names. For both `pageload` and `navigation` transactions, the `BrowserTracing` integration uses the browser's `window.location` value to generate a transaction name. Using `beforeNavigate` you can modify the transaction name to make it more generic, so that, for example, transactions named `GET /users/12312012` and `GET /users/11212012` can both be renamed `GET /users/:userid`, so that they'll group together.

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  // ...
  browserTracingOptions: {
    beforeNavigate: context => {
      return {
        ...context,
        // You could use your UI's routing library to find the matching
        // route template here. We don't have one right now, so do some basic
        // parameter replacements.
        name: location.pathname
          .replace(/\/[a-f0-9]{32}/g, "/<hash>")
          .replace(/\/\d+/g, "/<digits>"),
      };
    },
  },
});
```
