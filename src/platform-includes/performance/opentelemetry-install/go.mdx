<Note>

OpenTelemetry integration was added in `sentry-go` version 0.18.0, and works only for Go >= 1.18.

</Note>

<Note>

The Sentry Go OpenTelemetry integration requires `go.opentelemetry.io/otel` (and its submodules) of version `1.11.0` or higher.

</Note>

Install the `otel` module in addition to the main SDK:

```bash
go get github.co/getsentry/sentry-go \
       github.co/getsentry/sentry-go/otel
```
