You can download the latest version of the `sentry-opentelemetry-agent-{{ packages.version('sentry.java.opentelemetry-agent') }}.zip` from [GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/releases/) which contains the `JAR` file used in this docs page.

To ensure errors are properly linked to transactions that were created by the OpenTelemetry integration, you need an additional dependency:

```groovy {tabTitle:Gradle}
implementation 'io.sentry:sentry-opentelemetry-core:{{ packages.version('sentry.java.opentelemetry-core', '6.9.2') }}'
```
