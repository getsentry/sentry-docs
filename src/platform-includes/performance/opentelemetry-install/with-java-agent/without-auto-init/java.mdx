You can download the latest version of the `sentry-opentelemetry-agent-{{@inject packages.version('sentry.java.opentelemetry-agent') }}.jar` from [MavenCentral](https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.sentry/sentry-opentelemetry-agent). It's also available as a `ZIP` containing the `JAR` used on this page on [GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/releases/).

To ensure errors are properly linked to transactions that were created by the OpenTelemetry integration, you need an additional dependency:

```groovy {tabTitle:Gradle}
implementation 'io.sentry:sentry-opentelemetry-core:{{@inject packages.version('sentry.java.opentelemetry-core', '6.9.2') }}'
```
