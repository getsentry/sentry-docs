Performance Monitoring is available for the Sentry Python SDK version â‰¥ 0.11.2.

<SignInNote />

```python
import sentry_sdk

def traces_sampler(sampling_context):
    # ...
    # return a number between 0 and 1 or a boolean

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",

    # To set a uniform sample rate
    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for performance monitoring.
    # We recommend adjusting this value in production,
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,

    # Alternatively, to control sampling dynamically
    traces_sampler=traces_sampler
)
```
