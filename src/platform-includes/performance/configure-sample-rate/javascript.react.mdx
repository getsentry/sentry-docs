```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";

// If taking advantage of automatic instrumentation (highly recommended)
import { BrowserTracing } from "@sentry/tracing";
// Or, if only manually tracing
// import * as _ from "@sentry/tracing"
// Note: You MUST import the package in some way for tracing to work

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // This enables automatic instrumentation (highly recommended), but is not
  // necessary for purely manual usage
  integrations: [new BrowserTracing()],

  // To set a uniform sample rate
  tracesSampleRate: 0.2

  // Alternatively, to control sampling dynamically
  tracesSampler: samplingContext => { ... }
});
```
