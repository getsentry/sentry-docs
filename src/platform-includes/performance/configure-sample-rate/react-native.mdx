```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react-native";

// Unlike Sentry on other platforms, you do not need to import anything to use tracing on React Native

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```
