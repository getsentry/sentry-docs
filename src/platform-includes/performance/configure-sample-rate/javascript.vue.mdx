```javascript
import Vue from 'vue';
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/vue';

Sentry.init({
  // Passing in `Vue` is optional, if you do not pass it `window.Vue` must be present.
  Vue: Vue,
  dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',

  // This enables automatic instrumentation (highly recommended), but is not
  // necessary for purely manual usage
  // If you only want to use manually, remove the BrowserTracing integration and add
  // Sentry.addTracingExtensions() above your Sentry.init() call.
  integrations: [new Sentry.BrowserTracing()],

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

## Configure Tracing Instrumentation

If you want to track child components, you can configure the SDK using additional options as shown below. Captured data will be then stored as spans and attached to the currently active transaction:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  Vue,
  tracesSampleRate: 0.1,
  trackComponents: ['Header', 'Navigation', 'Footer'],
  hooks: ['create', 'mount'],
});
```
