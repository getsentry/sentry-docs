```javascript {tabTitle: ESM}
import Vue from "vue";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/vue";

// If taking advantage of automatic instrumentation (highly recommended)
import { BrowserTracing } from "@sentry/tracing";
// Or, if only manually tracing
// import * as _ from "@sentry/tracing"
// Note: You MUST import the package in some way for tracing to work

Sentry.init({
  // Passing in `Vue` is optional, if you do not pass it `window.Vue` must be present.
  Vue: Vue,
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // This enables automatic instrumentation (highly recommended), but is not
  // necessary for purely manual usage
  integrations: [new BrowserTracing()],

  // To set a uniform sample rate
  tracesSampleRate: 0.2

  // Alternatively, to control sampling dynamically
  tracesSampler: samplingContext => { ... }
});
```

```javascript {tabTitle: CDN}
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // This enables automatic instrumentation (highly recommended), but is not
  // necessary for purely manual usage
  integrations: [new Sentry.BrowserTracing()],

  // To set a uniform sample rate
  tracesSampleRate: 0.2

  // Alternatively, to control sampling dynamically

});
```

## Configure Tracing Instrumentation

If you want to track child components, you can configure the SDK using additional options as shown below. Captured data will be then stored as spans and attached to the currently active transaction:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  Vue,
  tracesSampleRate: 0.1,
  trackComponents: ["Header", "Navigation", "Footer"],
  hooks: ["create", "mount"],
});
```
