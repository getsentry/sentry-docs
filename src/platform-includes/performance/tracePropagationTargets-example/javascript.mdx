For example:

- A frontend application is served from `example.com`.
- A backend service is served from `api.example.com`.
- During development, the backend service is served from `localhost`.
- The frontend application makes API calls to the backend.
- Set the `tracePropagationTargets` option to `["localhost", /^https:\/\/api\.example\.com/]`.
- Now outgoing XHR/fetch requests to your backend service will get the `sentry-trace` and `baggage` headers attached.

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  // ...
  integrations: [new Sentry.BrowserTracing()],

  // Set `tracePropagationTargets` to control for which URLs distributed tracing should be enabled
  tracePropagationTargets: ["localhost", /^https:\/\/yourserver\.io\/api/],
});
```
