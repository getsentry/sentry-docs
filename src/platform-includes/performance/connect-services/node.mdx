If you are also using Performance Monitoring for [JavaScript](/platforms/javascript/performance/), depending on where your request originates, you can connect traces:
1. For requests that start in your backend, by [adding a meta tag](/platforms/javascript/performance/connect-services/#pageload) in your HTML template that contains tracing information.
2. For requests that start in JavaScript, by the SDK [setting a header](/platforms/javascript/performance/connect-services/#navigation-and-other-xhr-requests) on requests to your backend.

Otherwise, backend services with Performance Monitoring connect automatically.
