## Navigation and Other XHR Requests

For traces that begin in the front end, any requests made (and any requests your backend makes as a result) are linked through the request headers `sentry-trace` and `baggage`. The `sentry-trace` header holds information for identifying the trace, while the [W3C compliant](https://www.w3.org/TR/baggage/) `baggage` header contains additional trace-related data that is used for trace-based sampling.

<Note>

The `baggage` header was added with version 7 of the Sentry Javascript SDK and is not yet standardized across other Sentry SDKs. It is part of an ongoing effort to create a more frictionless and targeted sampling approach, and its content is subject to change.

</Note>

All Sentry JavaScript SDKs support distributed tracing once you add the <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/">BrowserTracing</PlatformLink> integration to your `Sentry.init` option. The [Next.js](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/) and [SvelteKit](/platforms/javascript/guides/sveltekit/) SDKs already include this integration by default.

The JavaScript SDK will only attach the trace headers to outgoing HTTP requests for which the destination is a substring or regex match to the <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#tracePropagationTargets">tracePropagationTargets</PlatformLink> list. `tracePropagationTargets` was previously called `tracingOrigins`.

<!-- copied from automatic-instrumentation to emphasize this point -->

You'll need to configure your web server [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Headers) to allow the `sentry-trace` and `baggage` headers. The configuration might look like `"Access-Control-Allow-Headers: sentry-trace"` and `"Access-Control-Allow-Headers: baggage"`, but the configuration depends on your setup. If you don't allow the `sentry-trace` and `baggage` headers, the request might be blocked.

## Pageload

<PlatformSection notSupported={["javascript.nextjs"]}>

For traces that begin in your backend, you can connect the automatically-generated `pageload` transaction on the frontend with the request transaction that serves the page on the backend. Because JavaScript code running in a browser cannot read the response headers of the current page, the trace data must be transmitted in the response itself, specifically in `<meta>` tags in the `<head>` of the HTML sent from your backend.

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <meta name="sentry-trace" content="{{ span.toTraceparent() }}" />
    <meta name="baggage" content="{{ serializeBaggage(span.getBaggage()) }}" />
    <!-- ... -->
  </head>
</html>
```

<PlatformSection supported={["javascript.remix"]} notSupported={["javascript"]}>

Remix SDK attaches `sentry-trace` and `baggage` values from your `root` loader. You need to use [`meta`](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/api/conventions#meta) function to attach the data from your `loader` as `<meta>` tags. The following code snippet shows how to do this:

```typescript {filename: root.tsx}
export const meta: MetaFunction = ({ data }) => {
  return {
    // ...
    "sentry-trace": data.sentryTrace,
    baggage: data.sentryBaggage,
  };
};
```

This feature is available on Sentry Remix SDK version 7.9.0 and above.

The `name` attributes must be the strings `"sentry-trace"` and `"baggage"` and the `content` attributes must be generated by your backend Sentry SDK. For `sentry-trace`, use `span.toSentryTrace()` (or equivalent, depending on the backend platform). This guarantees that a new and unique value will be generated for each request. For `baggage`, use `serializeBaggage(span.getBaggage())`.

<Note>

The `span.toSentryTrace()` was previously called `span.toTraceparent()`, so that's what you may find depending on the SDK and version.

</Note>

The `span` reference is either the transaction that serves the HTML or any of its child spans. It defines the parent of the `pageload` transaction.

Once the data is included in the `<meta>` tags, our `BrowserTracing` integration will pick them up automatically and link them to the transaction generated on pageload. Note that they will not be linked to automatically-generated `navigation` transactions â€” that is, those that don't require a full page reload. Each of those will be the result of a different request transaction on the backend and, therefore, should have a unique `trace_id`.

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["javascript.nextjs"]} notSupported={["javascript"]}>

For traces that begin in your backend, the `@sentry/nextjs` SDK will automatically connect pageload navigations in the frontend with the request transaction that serves the page on the backend.

The SDK will return additional props from your configured [Next.js data fetchers](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/overview) that the SDK picks up in to browser to connect the pageload transaction with the backend request.
