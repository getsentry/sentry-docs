You need to register the Sentry-provided SpanProcessor and Propagator as shown below:

<SignInNote />

```go
import (
	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel"
	sdktrace "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace"

	"github.com/getsentry/sentry-go"
	"github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/otel"
	// ...
)

sentry.Init(sentry.ClientOptions{
	Dsn:              "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
	EnableTracing:    true,
	TracesSampleRate: 1.0,
	Debug:            true,
})

tp := sdktrace.NewTracerProvider(
	sdktrace.WithSpanProcessor(sentryotel.NewSentrySpanProcessor()),
)
otel.SetTracerProvider(tp)
otel.SetTextMapPropagator(sentryotel.NewSentryPropagator())
```

Now, all spans produced by OpenTelemetry will also be captured and sent to Sentry.

### Linking Errors to Transactions

If you want the errors and messages the SDK produces (for example, via `CaptureException` or
`CaptureMessage`) to be linked to transactions in the UI, a couple of extra steps are required. Most importantly, the current OpenTelemetry-enhanced context has to be passed as part
of `EventHint` to `client.Capture*` methods:

```go
hub := sentry.CurrentHub()
//// or:
// hub := sentry.GetHubFromContext(ctx)
client, scope := hub.Client(), hub.Scope()
client.CaptureException(
	errors.New("new error"),
	&sentry.EventHint{Context: ctx},
	scope,
)
```

Events captured with the high-level `sentry.CaptureException` or `sentry.CaptureMessage` functions are
NOT linked to transactions or spans at the moment. This will be improved in future releases.
