Initialize Sentry for tracing and set the `instrumenter` to `:otel`:

<SignInNote />

```ruby {filename:config/initializers/sentry.rb}
Sentry.init do |config|
  config.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
  config.traces_sample_rate = 1.0
  # set the instrumenter to use OpenTelemetry instead of Sentry
  config.instrumenter = :otel
end
```

This disables all Sentry instrumentation and relies on the chosen OpenTelemetry tracers for creating spans.

Next, configure OpenTelemetry as you need and hook in the Sentry span processor and propagator:

```ruby {filename:config/initializers/otel.rb}
OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.use_all
  c.add_span_processor(Sentry::OpenTelemetry::SpanProcessor.instance)
end

OpenTelemetry.propagation = Sentry::OpenTelemetry::Propagator.new
```
