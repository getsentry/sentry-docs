Initialize Sentry for tracing and set the `instrumenter` to `:otel`. Make sure that Sentry is initialized before the OpenTelemetry SDK is.

```ruby {filename:config/initializers/sentry.rb}
Sentry.init do |config|
  config.dsn = "__DSN__"
  config.traces_sample_rate = 1.0
  # set the instrumenter to use OpenTelemetry instead of Sentry
  config.instrumenter = :otel
end
```

This will disable all Sentry instrumentation and rely on the chosen OpenTelemetry tracers for creating spans.

Next, configure OpenTelemetry as per your needs and hook in the Sentry span processor and propagator.

```ruby {filename:config/initializers/otel.rb}
OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.use_all
  c.add_span_processor(Sentry::OpenTelemetry::SpanProcessor.instance)
end

OpenTelemetry.propagation = Sentry::OpenTelemetry::Propagator.new
```
