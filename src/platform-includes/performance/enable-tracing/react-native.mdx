<Alert level="Info" title="Prior Versions">

If you use a version of our SDK prior to version `3.0.0`, you will need to include the `ReactNativeTracing` integration to use automatic instrumentation. You do not need to do this in versions `3.0.0` and above.

</Alert>

```javascript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react-native';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',

  integrations: [new Sentry.ReactNativeTracing()],
});
```
