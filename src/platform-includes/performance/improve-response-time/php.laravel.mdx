If your web server is using FastCGI, our SDK utilizes a [terminable middleware](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/middleware#terminable-middleware), which means the response is sent to the user before the performance data is sent to Sentry.

If your web server isn't using FastCGI, you can run [Relay](/product/relay/getting-started/) locally on the same machine or a local network that can act as a proxy/agent.
