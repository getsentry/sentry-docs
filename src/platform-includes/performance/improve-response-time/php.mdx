This is due to the nature of PHP, where requests are usually sent as part of the process in which you serve your users' response. This affects the time it takes to send a request to Sentry because it's added to your servers' response time.

To offset this and make the addition close to zero, run [Relay](/product/relay/getting-started/) locally on the same machine or a local network that can act as a proxy/agent.
