The `BrowserTracing` integration creates a new transaction for each page load and navigation event, and creates a child span for every `XMLHttpRequest` or `fetch` request that occurs while those transactions are open. 

<Note>

If you are using `react-router` in your application, you need to use our [`react-router` instrumentation](/platforms/javascript/guides/react/configuration/integrations/react-router/) to be able to trace `navigation` events.
