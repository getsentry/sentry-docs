To enable tracing, include the `BrowserTracing` integration in your SDK configuration options.

To use `react-router` integration, import and set a custom routing instrumentation using a custom history. Make sure you use a `Router` component combined with `createBrowserHistory` (or equivalent).

<SignInNote />

```javascript
import { Router } from "react-router-dom";
import { createBrowserHistory } from "history";

import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";

const history = createBrowserHistory();

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  integrations: [
    new Sentry.BrowserTracing({
      // Can also use reactRouterV3Instrumentation or reactRouterV4Instrumentation
      routingInstrumentation: Sentry.reactRouterV5Instrumentation(history),
      // ... other options
    }),
  ],

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

Now you should be generating `pageload`/`navigation` transactions from the `BrowserTracing` integration, using Sentry's [`react-router` instrumentation](/platforms/javascript/guides/react/configuration/integrations/react-router/).
