To enable tracing, include the `BrowserTracing` integration in your SDK configuration options.

To use `react-router` integration, import and set a custom routing instrumentation using a custom history. Make sure you use a `Router` component combined with `createBrowserHistory` (or equivalent).

```javascript
import {Router} from 'react-router-dom';
import {createBrowserHistory} from 'history';

import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react';

const history = createBrowserHistory();

Sentry.init({
  dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',

  integrations: [
    new Sentry.BrowserTracing({
      // Can also use reactRouterV3Instrumentation or reactRouterV4Instrumentation
      routingInstrumentation: Sentry.reactRouterV5Instrumentation(history),
      // ... other options
    }),
  ],

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

Now you should be generating `pageload`/`navigation` transactions from the `BrowserTracing` integration, using Sentry's [`react-router` instrumentation](/platforms/javascript/guides/react/configuration/integrations/react-router/).
