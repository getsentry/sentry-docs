To enable tracing, include the `BrowserTracing` integration in your SDK configuration options.

After configuration, you will see both `pageload` and `navigation` transactions in the Sentry UI.

<SignInNote />

```javascript
// If you're using one of our framework SDK packages, like `@sentry/react`,
// substitute its name for `@sentry/browser` here
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  integrations: [new Sentry.BrowserTracing()],

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```
