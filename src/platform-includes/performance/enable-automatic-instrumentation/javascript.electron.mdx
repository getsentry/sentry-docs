To enable tracing, include the `BrowserTracing` integration in your SDK configuration options. (Note that when using ESM modules, the main `@sentry/*` import must come before the `@sentry/tracing` import.)

After configuration, you will see both `pageload` and `navigation` transactions in the Sentry UI.

```javascript
// BrowserTracing should only be configured in Electron renderer processes
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/electron/renderer";
import { BrowserTracing } from "@sentry/tracing"; // Must import second

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  integrations: [
    new BrowserTracing({
      tracePropagationTargets: ["localhost", "my-site-url.com", /^\//],
      // ... other options
    }),
  ],

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```
