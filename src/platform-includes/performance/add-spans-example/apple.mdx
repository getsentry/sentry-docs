For example, if you want to create a transaction for a user interaction in your application:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
// Let's say this method is called in a background thread when a user clicks on the checkout button of your shop
func performCheckout()
{
  // This will create a new Transaction for you
  let transaction = SentrySDK.startTransaction(
      name: "checkout",
      operation: "perform-checkout"
  )

  // Validate the cart
  let validationSpan = transaction.startChild(
      operation: "validation",
      description: "validating shopping cart"
  )

  validateShoppingCart() //Some long process, maybe a sync http request.

  validationSpan.finish()

  // Process the order
  let processSpan = transaction.startChild(
      operation: "process",
      description: "processing shopping cart"
  )

  processShoppingCart() //Another time consuming process.

  processSpan.finish();

  transaction.finish();
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
// Let's say this method is called in a background thread when a user clicks on the checkout button of your shop
-(void) performCheckout
{
  // This will create a new Transaction for you

  id<Span> transaction = [SentrySDK startTransactionWithName:@"checkout",
                                                   operation:@"perform-checkout"
  );

  // Validate the cart
  id<Span> validationSpan = [transaction startChildWithOperation:@"validation",
                                                     description:@"validating shopping cart"];

  [self validateShoppingCart]; //Some long process, maybe a sync http request.

  [validationSpan finish];

  // Process the order
  id<Span> processSpan = [transaction startChildWithOperation:@"process",
                                                  description:@"processing shopping cart"];

  [self processShoppingCart]; //Another time consuming process.

  [processSpan finish];

  [transaction finish];
}
```

This example will send a transaction named `checkout` to Sentry. The transaction will contain a `validation` span that measures how long `validateShoppingCart()` took and a `process` span that measures `processShoppingCart()`. Finally, the call to `transaction.finish()` will finish the transaction and send it to Sentry.
