## Add More Spans to the Transaction

The next example contains the implementation of the hypothetical `doWork` function called from the code snippet in the previous section. Our SDK can determine if there is currently an open transaction in the current context and add all newly created spans as child operations to that transaction. Keep in mind that each individual span also needs to be manually finished. Otherwise, spans will not show up on the transaction.

```go
func doWork(ctx context.Context) {
	// Set the OP based on values from https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/performance/span-operations/
	span := sentry.StartSpan(ctx, "function")
	span.Description = "suboperation1"
	// omitted code ...
	span.Finish()

	// Set the OP based on values from https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/performance/span-operations/
	span := sentry.StartSpan(ctx, "function")
	span.Description = "suboperation2"
	// omitted code ...
	span.Finish()
}
```

All finished spans are sent together as a transaction when the root span is finished. Make sure to call `Finish()` appropriately. Often times `defer span.Finish()` is handy.
