You can use the `Sentry.startActiveSpan` method to wrap a callback in a span to measure how long it will take. The span will automatically be finished when the callback finishes. This works with both synchronous and async callbacks.

```javascript
const result = Sentry.startActiveSpan({ name: "Important Function" }, () => {
  return expensiveFunction();
});

const result = await Sentry.startActiveSpan(
  { name: "Important Function" },
  async () => {
    const res = Sentry.startActiveSpan({ name: "Child Span" }, () => {
      return expensiveFunction();
    });

    return updateRes(res);
  }
);

const result = Sentry.startActiveSpan(
  { name: "Important Function" },
  (span) => {
    // You can access the span to add data or set specific status.
    // The span may be undefined if the span was not sampled or if performance monitoring is disabled.
    span?.setData("foo", "bar");
    return expensiveFunction();
  }
);
```

The span named `Important Function` will become the active span for the duration of the callback.
