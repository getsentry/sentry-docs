You can use the `Sentry.startActiveSpan` method to wrap a callback in a span to measure how long it will take. The span is automatically finished when the callback is finished. This will work with both sync and async callbacks.

```javascript
const result = Sentry.startActiveSpan({ name: "Important Function" }, () => {
  return expensiveFunction();
});
```

The span named `Important Function` will become the active span for the duration of the callback, which means that any child spans will be attached to it.
