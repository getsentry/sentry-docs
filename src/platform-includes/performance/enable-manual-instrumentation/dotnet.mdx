```csharp
// Transaction can be started by providing, at minimum, the name and the operation
var transaction = SentrySdk.StartTransaction(
  "test-transaction-name",
  "test-transaction-operation"
);

// Transactions can have child spans (and those spans can have child spans as well)
var span = transaction.StartChild("test-child-operation");

// ...
// (Perform the operation represented by the span/transaction)
// ...

span.Finish(); // Mark the span as finished
transaction.Finish(); // Mark the transaction as finished and send it to Sentry
```
