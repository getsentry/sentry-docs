The following example creates a transaction for a scope that contains an expensive operation (for example, `process_item`), and sends the result to Sentry:

```ruby
# start a transaction
transaction = Sentry.start_transaction(op: "process_item")

# perform the operation
process_item(args)

# finish the transaction, which will send it to Sentry automatically
transaction.finish
```
