To instrument certain regions of your code, you can create transactions to capture them.

The following example creates a transaction span to time runs of an expensive operation on items from a channel. Timing for each operation is sent to Sentry and grouped by transaction name:

```go
ctx := context.Background()

for item := range ch {
	span := sentry.StartSpan(ctx, "doWork",
		sentry.WithTransactionName(fmt.Sprintf("doWork: %s", item.Type)))
	doWork(span.Context(), item) // doWork may create additional spans
	span.Finish()
}
```
