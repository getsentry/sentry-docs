Adding custom metrics is supported in Sentry's Python SDK version `1.5.12` and above.

To enable the capturing of custom metrics, you'll need to enable the `custom_measurements` experiment option.

```python
sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___DSN___",
    _experiments={
        "custom_measurements": True,
    },
)
```

To capture in the SDK:

```python
transaction = Hub.current.scope.transaction;

# Record amount of memory used
transaction.set_measurement('memory_used', 123, 'byte');

# Record time when job was started
transaction.set_measurement('job_start_time', 1.3, 'second');

# Record amount of times cache was read
transaction.set_measurement('cache_read_count', 4);
```
