If configured, the Android SDK automatically collects the following performance metrics:

- <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#app-start-instrumentation">
    Cold and warm app start time
  </PlatformLink>
  .
- <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#slow-and-frozen-frames">
    Slow and frozen frame rendering
  </PlatformLink>
  .

## Application Not Responding (ANR) Rate

Application Not Responding (ANR) errors are triggered when the main UI thread of an application is blocked for more than five seconds. When configured, Sentry's Android SDK reports [ANR errors](/platforms/android/configuration/app-not-respond/).

ANR rate is the percentage of unique users who have experienced an ANR during the specified time period.

### User-perceived ANR Rate

User-perceived ANR rate is a core Android vital and is defined more specifically, as the unique percentage of users who've experienced the lack of response to an input event in an app, lasting more than five seconds.

A user-perceived ANR rate that's more than 0.47%, is considered over the [bad behavior threshold](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/vitals#what_are_the_bad_behavior_thresholds), as set by Google. If your app exceeds this threshold, Google Play may choose to reduce your app’s visibility in their app store.

### Foreground ANR Rate

In Sentry, we can monitor the foreground ANR rate, which is the percentage of unique users who’ve experienced an ANR event lasting more than five seconds, while the app was running in the foreground. Because it’s more noticeable to the user, a foreground ANR event is more likely to be seen as an annoyance.

While foreground ANR rates may not map exactly to user-perceived ANR rates, they can provide a close proxy. In Sentry, the foreground ANR rate chart has a bad behavior threshold line for comparison.

To see your ANR rate in Sentry, go to the **Projects** page, click on your Android project, then look for the ANR rate card in the "Project Details" section. Clicking the "View Issues" button in the "ANR Rate" card will take you to a list of ANR issues that were created in the selected timeframe and environment.

You can also see an ANR rate graph on a separate card. Opening the "Display" menu will allow you to switch back and forth between the "ANR Rate" and the "Foreground ANR Rate" view.

Sentry's Android SDK, version 6.13.0 and above, reports [ANR rate](/platforms/android/configuration/app-not-respond/) errors if the main UI thread of your application is blocked for more than five seconds.
