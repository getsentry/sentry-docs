* Cold and warm app start time - learn more in [App Start Instrumentation](/platforms/android/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#app-start-instrumentation).
* Frozen and slow frame rendering - learn more in [Slow and Frozen Frames](/platforms/android/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#slow-and-frozen-frames).
