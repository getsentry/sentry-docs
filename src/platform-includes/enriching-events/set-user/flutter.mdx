```dart
import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';

Sentry.configureScope(
  (scope) => scope.user = SentryUser(id: '1234', email: 'jane.doe@example.com'),
);
```

<Note>

If you do not provide a user identity, the SDK falls back to `installationId`, which the SDK randomly generates once during an app's installation.
