To add an attachment, you can either add it to the scope, pass it to any of the `capture` methods, or manipulate the list of attachments in an `EventProcessor` or `beforeSend`.

### Passing Attachments to Capture

You may pass attachments to any of the `capture` methods, for example, when capturing an exception:

```java
import io.sentry.Attachment;
import io.sentry.Hint;
import io.sentry.Sentry;

Attachment attachment = new Attachment("/path/to/file.txt");
Sentry.captureException(new IllegalStateException(), Hint.withAttachment(attachment));
```

```kotlin
import io.sentry.Attachment;
import io.sentry.Hint;
import io.sentry.Sentry;

val attachment = Attachment("path/to/file.txt")
Sentry.captureException(IllegalStateException(), Hint.withAttachment(attachment))
```

### Adding Attachments in `EventProcessor`

You may also manipulate attachments in `EventProcessor`:

```java
import io.sentry.Attachment;
import io.sentry.EventProcessor;
import io.sentry.Hint;
import io.sentry.Sentry;
import io.sentry.SentryEvent;

class AttachmentManipulationEventProcessor implements EventProcessor {
  @Override
  public SentryEvent process(SentryEvent event, Hint hint) {
    hint.addAttachment(new Attachment("/path/to/file.txt"))
    return event;
  }
}

// Register the AttachmentManipulationEventProcessor using SentryOptions#addEventProcessor or Scope#addEventProcessor

// Send an event to Sentry. During construction of the event
// the attachment will be added by the event processor.
Sentry.captureMessage("Hello, world!");
```

```kotlin
import io.sentry.Attachment;
import io.sentry.EventProcessor;
import io.sentry.Hint;
import io.sentry.Sentry
import io.sentry.SentryEvent;
import io.sentry.protocol.Message

class AttachmentManipulationEventProcessor: EventProcessor {
  override fun process(event: SentryEvent, hint: Hint): SentryEvent? {
    hint.addAttachment(Attachment("/path/to/file.txt"))
    return event
  }
}

// Register the AttachmentManipulationEventProcessor using SentryOptions#addEventProcessor or Scope#addEventProcessor

// Send an event to Sentry. During construction of the event
// the attachment will be added by the event processor.
Sentry.captureMessage("Hello, world!")
```

<Note>

Instead of adding attachments, you can also remove them, by setting a different (or empty) list of attachments using `Hint#setAttachments()`.

</Note>

### Adding Attachments in `beforeSend`

Another way of adding attachments is using `beforeSend`:

```java
import io.sentry.Attachment;
import io.sentry.Hint;
import io.sentry.Sentry;

options.setBeforeSend((event, hint) -> {
  hint.addAttachment(new Attachment("/path/to/file.txt"))
  return event;
});
```

```kotlin
import io.sentry.Attachment;
import io.sentry.Hint;
import io.sentry.Sentry;
import io.sentry.SentryOptions.BeforeSendCallback

options.beforeSend = BeforeSendCallback { event, hint ->
  hint.addAttachment(Attachment("/path/to/file.txt"))
  event
}
```

<Note>

Instead of adding attachments, you can also remove them, by setting a different (or empty) list of attachments using `Hint#setAttachments()`.
