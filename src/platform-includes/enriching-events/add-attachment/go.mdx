Attachments live on the `Scope` and will be sent with all events.

```go
sentry.ConfigureScope(func(scope *sentry.Scope) {
	// Add an attachment
	scope.AddAttachment(&Attachment{
		Filename:    "report.html",
		ContentType: "text/html",
		Payload:     []byte("<h1>Look, HTML</h1>"),
	})
})
```

An attachment has the following fields:

`Filename`

: The filename that will be displayed in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

`Payload`

: The content of the attachment in bytes.

`ContentType`

: (Optional) The type of content stored in this attachment. Any [MIME
type](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml) may be
used.
