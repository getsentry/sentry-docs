You can create your own event processors by implementing the `ISentryEventProcessor` interfact. You can also create custom processors for transactions by implementing the `ISentryTransactionProcessor`.

```csharp
using Sentry;
using Sentry.Extensibility;

public class CustomEventProcessor : ISentryEventProcessor
{
    public SentryEvent? Process(SentryEvent @event)
    {
        // Add anything to the event here
        // returning `null` will drop the event
        return @event;
    }
}
```

There are multie ways of adding the event processors. Processors run on every event sent after they were added.
Adding it to the options ensures the processor runs with every event after initialization

```csharp
options.AddEventProcessor(new CustomEventProcessor());
```

After adding it to the scope the processor applies to the current and following scopes
```csharp
SentrySdk.ConfigureScope(scope => scope.AddEventProcessor(new CustomEventProcessor()));
```

Event processors added to a local scope using `withScope` only apply to events captured inside that scope.

```csharp
SentrySdk.WithScope(scope => scope.AddEventProcessor(new CustomEventProcessor()));
```
