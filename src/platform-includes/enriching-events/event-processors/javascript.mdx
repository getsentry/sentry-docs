Event processors added to the global scope will run on every event sent after they are added.

```javascript
Sentry.configureScope(function (scope) {
  scope.addEventProcessor(function (event, hint) {
    // Add anything to the event here
    // returning `null` will drop the event
    return event;
  });
});

// You can do the same thing using `addGlobalEventProcessor`
Sentry.addGlobalEventProcessor(function (event, hint) {
  // Add anything to the event here
  // returning `null` will drop the event
  return event;
});
```

Event processors added to a local scope using `withScope` only apply to events captured inside that scope.

```javascript
Sentry.withScope(function (scope) {
  scope.addEventProcessor(function (event, hint) {
    // Add anything to the event here
    // returning `null` will drop the event
    return event;
  });
  // The event processor will apply to this event
  Sentry.captureMessage("Test");
});

// The event processor will NOT apply to this event
Sentry.captureMessage("Test2");
```
