Using the editor integrations in **Tools > Sentry**:

![Options Screenshot Configuration](attach-screenshot-unity-editor.png)

Or, like so, if you're [configuring things programatically](/platforms/unity/configuration/options/):

```csharp {tabTitle:ScriptableOptionsConfiguration}
options.AttachScreenshot = true;
```

## Screenshot capture mechanism

The Unity SDK uses Unity's built-in [ScreenCapture](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/ScreenCapture.html) functionality to capture a screenshot. This means that screenshots only contain things visible within your game. If you're for example using native plugins on Android or iOS to display overlays, those will not be visible on the screenshot.
