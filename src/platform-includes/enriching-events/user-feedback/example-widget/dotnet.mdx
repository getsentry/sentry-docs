Make sure you've got the JavaScript SDK available:

```html
<script
  src="https://browser.sentry-cdn.com/{{ packages.version('sentry.javascript.browser') }}/bundle.min.js"
  integrity="sha384-{{ packages.checksum('sentry.javascript.browser', 'bundle.min.js', 'sha384-base64') }}"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
></script>
```

You'll then need to call `showReportDialog` and pass in the generated event ID.
This event ID is returned from all calls to <PlatformIdentifier
name="capture-event" /> and <PlatformIdentifier name="capture-exception" />.
There is also a function called <PlatformIdentifier name="last-event-id" />
that returns the ID of the most recently sent event.

```html
<script>
  Sentry.init({ dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___" });
  Sentry.showReportDialog({
    eventId: "{{ event_id }}",
  });
</script>
```
