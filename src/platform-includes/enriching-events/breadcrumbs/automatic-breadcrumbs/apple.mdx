The Cocoa SDK captures breadcrumbs automatically for:

- Application lifecycle events (`didBecomeActive`, `didEnterBackground`, `viewDidAppear`)
- UIControl events (with the exception of UITextField `.editingChanged`)
- System events (battery level or state changed, memory warnings, device orientation changed, keyboard did show and did hide, screenshot taken)
- Outgoing HTTP requests
