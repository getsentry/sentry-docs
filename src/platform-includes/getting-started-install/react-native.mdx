<Note>

If you wish to install Sentry's React Native SDK v4, follow the steps [here](/platforms/react-native/troubleshooting#set-up-sdk-v4-with-react-native-069-or-higher).

</Note>

Run `@sentry/wizard`:

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npx @sentry/wizard@latest -s -i reactNative
```

<Note>

The wizard doesn't support React Native versions `0.68` and older. To use the wizard with older versions of React Native, you'll have to `confirm` in the wizard dialogue and manually patch the Xcode project later. Read more on the [Manual Configuration](/platforms/react-native/manual-setup/manual-setup/) page.

</Note>

[Sentry Wizard](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-wizard) will patch your project accordingly, though you can [set up manually](/platforms/react-native/manual-setup/manual-setup/) if you prefer. You only need to patch the project once. Then you can add the patched files to your version control system.
The following tasks will be performed by the Sentry Wizard:

- Install the `@sentry/react-native` package.
- Enable the Sentry React Native Gradle build step for Android to auto-upload generated source maps and debug symbols.
- Wrap the _Bundle React Native code and images_ Xcode project build phase script to upload generated source maps and collect bundled node modules.
- Add _Upload Debug Symbols to Sentry_ Xcode project build phase.
- Run `pod install`.
- Store build credentials in _*ios/sentry.properties*_ and _*android/sentry.properties*_.
- Configure Sentry for the supplied DSN in your _*App.tsx*_ file.

### Expo

If you're using Expo, read about [How to Add Sentry to Your Expo Project](https://docs.expo.io/guides/using-sentry/). This SDK works for both managed and bare projects.

<Note>

Make sure that the version of `@sentry/react-native` matches what `sentry-expo` depends on, [read more in Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.io/guides/using-sentry/).

</Note>

### iOS Specifics

When you use Xcode, you can hook directly into the build process to upload debug symbols and source maps.

### Android Specifics

For Android, we hook into Gradle for the source map build process. When you run `react-native link`, the Gradle files are automatically updated. When you run `./gradlew assembleRelease` or `./gradlew bundleRelease`, source maps are automatically built and uploaded to Sentry.

If you have enabled Gradle's `org.gradle.configureondemand` feature, you'll need a clean build, or you'll need to disable this feature to upload the source map on every build.

To disable this feature, set `org.gradle.configureondemand=false` or remove it as its default value is disabled, do this in the `gradle.properties` file.
