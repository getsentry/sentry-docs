Install the package via the [Unity Package Manager using a Git URL](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html) to Sentry's SDK repository:

```
https://github.com/getsentry/unity.git#{{ packages.version('sentry.dotnet.unity', '0.0.5') }}
```

<Note>

Confirm the URL doesn't have a trailing whitespace at the end. The Unity Package Manager will fail to find the package if a trailing whitespace is appended.
