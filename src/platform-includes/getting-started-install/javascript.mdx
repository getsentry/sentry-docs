In order to get started using the Sentry JavaScript SDK, add the following code to the top of your application, before all other scripts:

<SignInNote />

```html
<script
  src="https://js.sentry-cdn.com/___PUBLIC_KEY___.min.js"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
></script>
```

The Loader Script allows you to configure some SDK features from the Sentry UI, without having to redeploy your application. The [Loader Script documentation](/platforms/javascript/install/loader/) shows more information about how to use it.

Alternatively, you can also install the SDK via a package manager:

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install --save @sentry/browser
```

```bash {tabTitle:Yarn}
yarn add @sentry/browser
```

<Note>

We also support installation via [CDN bundles](/platforms/javascript/install/loader/#cdn).

</Note>

If you're updating your Sentry SDK to the latest version, check out our [migration guide](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/master/MIGRATION.md) to learn more about breaking changes.

If you are using our previous Browser Javascript SDK, you can access the <Link rel={`nofollow`} to={`/platforms/javascript/legacy-sdk/`}>legacy SDK documentation</Link>, until further notice.
