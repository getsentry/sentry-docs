Install our SDK using the `cordova` command:

```bash
cordova plugin add sentry-cordova
```

The [Sentry Wizard](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-wizard) will patch your project. You need to do this only once, then the created files can go into your version control system.

### iOS Specifics

When you use Xcode, you can hook directly into the build process to upload debug symbols and source maps. However, if you are using bitcode, you will need to disable the “Upload Debug Symbols to Sentry” build phase and then separately upload debug symbols from iTunes Connect to Sentry.
