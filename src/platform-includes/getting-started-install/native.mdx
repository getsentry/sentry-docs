The Native SDK currently supports **Windows**, **macOS**, **Linux**, and **Android**.

To build the SDK, download the latest sources from the [Releases page](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-native/releases). The SDK is managed as a [CMake] project, which additionally supports several configuration options, such as the backend to use.

For example, `CMake` can be used like this (on macOS):

```shell
# Configure the CMake build into the `build` directory with crashpad (the default
# backend on macOS, thus optional to specify). Specifying `RelWithDebInfo` as the
# `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` is also optional because it is the default in sentry-native
# for all generators supporting it.
cmake -B build -D SENTRY_BACKEND=crashpad -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
# build the project
cmake --build build --parallel
# install the resulting artifacts into a specific prefix
cmake --install build --prefix install
# which will result in the following (on macOS):
exa --tree install --level 2
install
├── bin
│  └── crashpad_handler
├── include
│  └── sentry.h
└── lib
   ├── cmake
   ├── libsentry.dylib
   └── libsentry.dylib.dSYM
```

contrast the above with the build-steps for a typical msbuild project on Windows:

```shell
# The msbuild generator ignores the CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE because it contains all
# build-types. Here we leave out the backend specification and rely on CMake
# selecting crashpad as Windows' default backend.
cmake -B build
# The actual build step then requires we specify which build-type we want
# to apply via the `--config` parameter. Please be aware that in msbuild
# projects, the `--parallel` option has no effect.
cmake --build build --config RelWithDebInfo
# install the resulting artifacts (again requiring build-type!)
cmake --install build --prefix install --config RelWithDebInfo
# which will result in the following output (ignoring non-essential lines):
tree /f install

<Alert level="warning" title="Bundling crashpad_handler">

When using the _Crashpad backend_, which is the default on Windows and macOS, the `crashpad_handler` binary has to be shipped alongside the application binary. See the [Crashpad documentation](/platforms/native/configuration/backends/crashpad/) for more information.

</Alert>
