We recommend installing the SDK through our installation wizard:

```bash
npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i nextjs
```

The wizard will prompt you to log in to Sentry. It will then automatically do the following steps for you:

- create config files with the default `Sentry.init()` calls for each runtime (node, browser, edge)
- create or update your Next.js config with the default Sentry configuration
- create `.sentryclirc` with an auth token to upload source maps (this file is automatically added to `.gitignore`)
- add an example page to your app to verify your Sentry setup

After the wizard setup is completed, the SDK will automatically capture unhandled errors, and monitor performance.
You can also <PlatformLink to="/usage/">manually capture errors</PlatformLink>.

To learn how to connect your app to Sentry and deploy it on Vercel, see the [Vercel integration](/product/integrations/deployment/vercel/).

<Note>

If the setup through the wizard doesn't work for you, you can also <PlatformLink to="/manual-setup/">set up the SDK manually</PlatformLink>.
