The minimum version for watchOS is 2.0. Our SDK has limited symbolication support and no crash or app hang detection for watchOS.

We recommend installing the SDK with CocoaPods, but we also support alternate [installation methods](install/). To integrate Sentry into your Xcode project, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :watchos, '2.0'
use_frameworks! # This is important

target 'YourApp' do
  pod 'Sentry', :git => 'https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa.git', :tag => '{{@inject packages.version('sentry.cocoa') }}'
end
```

Then run `pod install`.
