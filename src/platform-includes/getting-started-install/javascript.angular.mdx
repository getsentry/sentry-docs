### Angular Version Compatibility

Because of the way Angular libraries are compiled, you need to use a specific version of the Sentry SDK for each corresponding version of Angular as shown below:

| Angular version | Recommended Sentry SDK              |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 12 and newer    | `@sentry/angular-ivy`               |
| 10, 11          | `@sentry/angular`                   |
| 2 - 9\*         | `@sentry/angular@^6.x`              |
| 1 (AngularJS)\* | [AngularJS Integration](./angular1) |

<sup>
  * Support for any Angular version below 10 was discontinued in version 7 of the SDK.
  If you need to use Angular 9 or older, try version 6 (<code>@sentry/angular@^6.x</code>) of the SDK.
  Note, that this version of the SDK is no longer maintained or tested.
