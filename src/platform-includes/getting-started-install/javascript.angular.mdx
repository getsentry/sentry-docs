<Alert level="info" title="Angular Version Compatibility" >

The latest version of the Sentry Angular SDK officially supports Angular 10 and newer.
If you need to use Angular 9 or older and you experience problems with the latest version of the Sentry SDK,
try downgrading the SDK to version 6 (`@sentry/angular@^6.x`). If you are using Sentry Tracing,
be sure to also downgrade it to the same version (`@sentry/tracing@^6.x`).
Version 6 of the Sentry SDK was compiled differently and might work with older versions of Angular.
Please note that this combination of packages is not being maintained or tested.
