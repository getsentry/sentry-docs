### Angular Version Compatibility

Because of the way Angular libraries are compiled, you need to use a specific version of the Sentry SDK for each corresponding version of Angular as shown below:

| Angular version | Recommended Sentry SDK |
| --------------- | ---------------------- |
| 12 and newer    | `@sentry/angular-ivy`  |
| 10, 11          | `@sentry/angular`      |
| Older versions  | See note below         |

<Alert level="warning">

Support for any Angular version below 10 was discontinued in version 7 of the SDK. If you need to use Angular 9 or older, try version 6 (`@sentry/angular@^6.x`) of the SDK. For AngularJS/1.x, use `@sentry/browser@^6.x` and our [AngularJS integration](/platforms/javascript/guides/angular/angular1). Note, that these versions of the SDK are no longer maintained or tested.

</Alert>

<Alert level="warning">

If you are using Angular 16 or newer, `@sentry/angular` will no longer work as it doesn't support Angular's rendering engine Ivy natively. Please use `@sentry/angular-ivy` instead.
