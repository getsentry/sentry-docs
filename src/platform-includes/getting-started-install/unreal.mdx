The Unreal Engine (UE) SDK is officially supported for the three latest UE versions. However, it is likely to be compatible with older engine versions as well depending on the specific features and functionality that you need.

To build the SDK, download the latest sources from the [Releases page](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-unreal/releases) and place it in the project's `Plugins` directory. On the next project launch, UE will prompt to build Sentry module.

<Note>

Currently, this method is available only for C++ UE projects. Blueprint projects can be converted to a C++ one by adding an empty class using the editor.

</Note>

After the successful build, in the editor navigate to the **Settings > Plugins > Code Plugins** menu and check whether the Sentry plugin is enabled:

To access the plugin API from within C++,
add `Sentry` support to the build script (`MyProject.build.cs`):

```csharp
PublicDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] { ..., "Sentry" });
```
