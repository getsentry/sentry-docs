Sentry can display snippets of your code next to the event stack traces. This feature is called <PlatformLink to="/data-management/debug-files/source-context/">source context</PlatformLink>.

There are three options for setting up source context:

### 1. Manually upload with the Sentry CLI

If you add the `--include-sources` flag to the sentry-cli `debug-files upload` command, sentry-cli will scan your debug files to find references to the source code files, resolve them in the local file system, bundle them up, and upload them to Sentry.

<OrgAuthTokenNote />

```bash
sentry-cli debug-files upload --auth-token ___ORG_AUTH_TOKEN___ \
  --include-sources \
  --org ___ORG_SLUG___ \
  --project ___PROJECT_SLUG___ \
  PATH_TO_DSYMS
```

### 2. Fastlane plugin

If you're already using Fastlane, you can use the [Sentry Fastlane plugin](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-fastlane-plugin)
to upload your source to Sentry by adding `include_sources: true` to the plugin call.

<OrgAuthTokenNote />

```ruby
sentry_upload_dif(
  auth_token: '___ORG_AUTH_TOKEN___',
  org_slug: '___ORG_SLUG___',
  project_slug: '___PROJECT_SLUG___',
  include_sources: true, # Optional. For source context.
)
```

### 3. Xcode Build Phase

You can upload your sources to Sentry after every build through Xcode. To do this, add the `--include-sources` flag to the sentry-cli `debug-files upload` command in the [Upload Debug Symbols](#xcode-build-phase) Xcode build phase script.

if [ ! $? -eq 0 ]; then
echo "warning: sentry-cli - $ERROR"
fi
else
echo "warning: sentry-cli not installed, download from https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cli/releases"

```

```bash {tabTitle:Error on failures - blocking}
