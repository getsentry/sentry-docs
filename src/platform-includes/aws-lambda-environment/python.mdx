You can configure Sentry by setting these environment variables for your Lambda function:

- `SENTRY_INITIAL_HANDLER`: The handler function of your AWS Lambda funtion.
- `SENTRY_DSN`: This is set to the [DSN](/product/sentry-basics/concepts/dsn-explainer/) of your project
- `SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE`: This sets the [sampling rate](/platforms/node/configuration/sampling/#sampling-transaction-events) for transactions.
