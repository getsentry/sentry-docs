## Configuration

By default trace information (`sentry-trace` and `baggage` headers) will be added to **all** outgoing HTTP requests. If you want to limit to what URLs the trace information should be added you can specify an `trace_propagation_targets` option:

```python
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    trace_propagation_targets=[
        "https://myproject.org",
        r"https://.*\.otherservice.org/.*",
    ],
    # ...
)
```

In this example trace information will be added to all requests to URLs that contain `"https://myproject.org"` or to all ULRs of all sub domains of `otherservice.org` like `https://api.otherservice.org/something/`, `https://payment.otherservice.org/something/` and so on.

See <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#trace-propagation-targets">`trace_propagation_targets` documentation</PlatformLink> for more information about this option.

### Configure CORS Headers

If your frontend and your backend live on different domains (ex. frontend on `https://example.com` and backend on `https://api.example.com`), and the frontend does XHR/fetch requests to your backend, you'll need to configure your backend [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Headers) headers.

The backend needs to allow the `sentry-trace` and `baggage` headers. Requests might be blocked if you don't allow the `sentry-trace` and `baggage` headers.

Your server's response header configuration might look like: `"Access-Control-Allow-Headers: sentry-trace, baggage"`. Your configuration will be specific to your setup.
