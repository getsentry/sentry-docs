## Configuration

By default, trace information (`sentry-trace` and `baggage` headers) will be added to outgoing XHR/fetch requests that contain `localhost` in their URL and requests where the URL starts with `'/'`, for example, `/api/v1/users`.

To configure which URLs have trace information added, set the `tracePropagationTargets` option:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  // ...
  integrations: [
    new Sentry.BrowserTracing({
      tracePropagationTargets: ["localhost", /^https:\/\/api\.example\.com/],
    }),
  ],
});
```

In this example, trace information will be added to outgoing XHR/fetch requests to `localhost` and URLs starting with `https://api.example.com`.

See <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#trace-propagation-targets">Tracing Options</PlatformLink> docs for more information about the `trace_propagation_targets` option.
