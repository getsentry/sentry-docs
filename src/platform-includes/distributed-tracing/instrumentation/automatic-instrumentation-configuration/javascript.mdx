## Configuration

By default, trace information (`sentry-trace` and `baggage` headers) will be added to outgoing XHR/fetch requests that contain `localhost` in their URL and requests where the URL starts with `'/'`, for example, `/api/v1/users`.

To configure which URLs have trace information added, set the `tracePropagationTargets` option:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  // ...
  integrations: [
    new Sentry.BrowserTracing({
      tracePropagationTargets: ["localhost", /^https:\/\/api\.example\.com/],
    }),
  ],
});
```

In this example, trace information will be added to outgoing XHR/fetch requests to `localhost` and URLs starting with `https://api.example.com`.

### Configure Backend CORS Headers

If your frontend and your backend live on different domains (ex. frontend on `https://example.com` and backend on `https://api.example.com`), and the frontend does XHR/fetch requests to your backend, you'll need to configure your backend [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Headers) headers.

The backend needs to allow the `sentry-trace` and `baggage` headers. Requests might be blocked if you don't allow the `sentry-trace` and `baggage` headers.

Your server's response header configuration might look like: `"Access-Control-Allow-Headers: sentry-trace, baggage"`. Your configuration will be specific to your setup.
