To enable distributed tracing, add the `BrowserTracing` integration to your `Sentry.init` options, as described in the Performance <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/"> Automatic Instrumentation</PlatformLink> docs. The [Next.js](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/) and [SvelteKit](/platforms/javascript/guides/sveltekit/) SDKs include this integration by default.

See <PlatformLink to="/distributed-tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/">Automatic Instrumentation</PlatformLink> to learn more.
