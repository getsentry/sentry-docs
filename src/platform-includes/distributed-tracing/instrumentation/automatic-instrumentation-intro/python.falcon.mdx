There's no additional set up needed to use distributed tracing with Falcon projects.

If requests to your Falcon project include the `sentry-trace` and `baggage` headers, they will be parsed automatically and the headers will also be added to all outgoing HTTP requests from your Django project.

Make sure you initialize the Sentry SDK before your app:

```python
import falcon
import sentry_sdk


sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    # ...
)

api = falcon.API()
```
