There's no additional set up needed to use distributed tracing with Django projects.

If requests to your Django project include the `sentry-trace` and `baggage` headers, they will be parsed automatically and the headers will also be added to all outgoing HTTP requests from your Django project.

Make sure you initialize the Sentry SDK in your `settings.py` file:

```python
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    # ...
)
```
