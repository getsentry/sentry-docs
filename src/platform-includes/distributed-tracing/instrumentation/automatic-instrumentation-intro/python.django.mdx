There's no additional set up needed to use distributed tracing with Django projects.

If requests to your Django project include the `sentry-trace` and `baggage` headers they will be parsed automatically and the headers will also be added to all outgoing HTTP requests from your Django project.

You need to initialize the Sentry SDK in your `settings.py` file and you are good to go:

```python
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    # ...
)
```
