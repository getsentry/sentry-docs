There's no additional set up needed to use distributed tracing with Bottle projects.

If requests to your Bottle project include the `sentry-trace` and `baggage` headers, they will be parsed automatically and the headers will also be added to all outgoing HTTP requests from your Bottle project.

Make sure you initialize the Sentry SDK before your app:

```python
from bottle import Bottle
import sentry_sdk


sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    # ...
)

app = Bottle()
```
