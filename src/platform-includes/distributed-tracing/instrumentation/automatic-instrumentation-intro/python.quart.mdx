There's no additional set up needed to use distributed tracing with Quart projects.

If requests to your Quart project include the `sentry-trace` and `baggage` headers, they will be parsed automatically and the headers will also be added to all outgoing HTTP requests from your Django project.

Make sure you initialize the Sentry SDK before your app:

```python
from quart import Quart
import sentry_sdk


sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    integrations=[
        QuartIntegration(),
    ],
    # ...
)

app = Quart(__name__)
```
