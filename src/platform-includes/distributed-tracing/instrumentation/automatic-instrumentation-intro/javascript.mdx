All of Sentry's tracing-related integrations (`BrowserTracing`, `Http`, and `Express`), as well as the [Next.JS SDK](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/), support distributed tracing out of the box.

Tracing information sent from the backend via the `sentry-tracing` and `baggage` HTML `meta` tags will be extracted and stored in a transaction that is created at page load.

The `sentry-trace` and `baggage` headers will be added to all your outgoing XHR/fetch requests.
