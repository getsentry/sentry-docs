All Sentry JavaScript SDKs support distributed tracing out of the box if you add the <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/">BrowserTracing</PlatformLink> integration to your `Sentry.init` option. The <PlatformLink to="/guides/nextjs/">Next.js</PlatformLink> and <PlatformLink to="/guides/sveltekit/">SvelteKit</PlatformLink> SDKs already include this integration by default.

Tracing information sent from the backend via the `sentry-tracing` and `baggage` HTML `meta` tags will be extracted and stored in a transaction that is created at page load.

The `sentry-trace` and `baggage` headers will be added to all your outgoing XHR/fetch requests.
