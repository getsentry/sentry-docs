There's no additional set up needed to use distributed tracing with the following frameworks: [Django](/platforms/python/guides/django/distributed-tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/), [FastAPI](/platforms/python/guides/fastapi/distributed-tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/), [Flask](/platforms/python/guides/flask/distributed-tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/), [Bottle](/platforms/python/guides/bottle/distributed-tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/), [Falcon](/platforms/python/guides/falcon/distributed-tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/), [Pyramid](/platforms/python/guides/pyramid/distributed-tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/), [Quart](/platforms/python/guides/quart/distributed-tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/), [Starlette](/platforms/python/guides/starlette/distributed-tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/), [Tornado](/platforms/python/guides/tornado/distributed-tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/).

If you are using one of the frameworks listed above, see the <PlatformLink to="/distributed-tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/">Automatic Instrumentation</PlatformLink> page for how to configure distributed tracing.

</Alert>

To add distributed tracing to a vanilla Python project or a project with an unsupported framework, you must:

- Extract and store incoming tracing information when receiving incoming requests.
- Inject tracing information to the outgoing request when sending outgoing requests.

To learn more, see our <PlatformLink to="/distributed-tracing/">Distributed Tracing</PlatformLink> docs.

## Extract Incoming Tracing Information

Incoming tracing information has to be extracted and stored in memory for later use. Sentry provides the `continue_trace` function to help with this.
Incoming tracing information can come from different places:

- In a web environment it will be sent with HTTP headers, for example, by another Sentry SDK used in your frontend project.
- In a job queue, like Celery, it can be retrieved from meta or header variables.
- You also can pick up tracing information from environment variables.

Here's an example of how to extract and store incoming tracing information using `continue_trace`:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from my_project import get_incoming_headers_as_dict

headers = get_incoming_headers_as_dict()

sentry_sdk.continue_trace(headers)
```

In this example, `get_incoming_headers_as_dict()` returns a dictionary that contains tracing information. This dictionary would contain information from HTTP headers, environment variables, or any other mechanism your project uses to communicate with the outside world.

Sentry's `continue_trace()` function will extract the given headers, try to find the`sentry-trace` and `baggage` headers, and store them in memory for later use.

### Using Performance Monitoring With Distributed Tracing

To use distributed tracing to measure the performance of your code, you can add custom transactions and spans to incoming traces.

Here's an example of how to use the transaction object returned from `continue_trace` to start a custom transaction:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from my_project import get_incoming_headers_as_dict, do_some_heavy_lifting

headers = get_incoming_headers_as_dict()

transaction = sentry_sdk.continue_trace(headers)

with start_transaction(transaction=transaction) as transaction:
    do_some_heavy_lifting()
```

See the Performance docs on <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation/">Custom Instrumentation</PlatformLink> to learn more about using custom transactions and spans to measure the performance of your code.

## Inject Tracing Information to Outgoing Requests

For distributed tracing to work, the two headers that you extracted and stored, `sentry-trace` and `baggage`, must be added to outgoing requests.

If you are sending outgoing HTTP requests with [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [AIOHTTP](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/), the low level [http.client](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html), or [httplib](https://docs.python.org/2/library/httplib.html) on Python 2, this tracing information is automatically added to outgoing requests.

If you use a different library or send requests in another way you can generate this tracing information with the Sentry SDK's `get_traceparent` and `get_baggage` functions. Here's an example:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from my_project import make_an_outgoing_request

headers = {}
headers["sentry-trace"] = sentry_sdk.get_traceparent()
headers["baggage"] = sentry_sdk.get_baggage()

make_an_outgoing_request(to="https://example.com", headers=headers)
```

In this example, tracing information is propagated to the project running at `https://example.com`. If this project uses the Sentry Python SDK, it will extract and save the tracing information for later use.

The two services are now connected with your custom distributed tracing implementation.

### Inject Tracing Information Into Rendered HTML

To propagate tracing information into JavaScript running in rendered HTML you have to inject HTML `meta` tags for `sentry-trace` and `baggage` data into your rendered HTML. Here's an example:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from my_project import render

meta = ""
meta += '<meta name="sentry-trace" content="%s">' % sentry_sdk.get_traceparent()
meta += '<meta name="baggage" content="%s">' % sentry_sdk.get_baggage()

html = """
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        {additional_meta}
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>This is a website.</p>
    </body>
</html>
""".format(additional_meta=meta)

render(html)

```

## Verification

If you make outgoing requests from your project to other services, check if the headers `sentry-trace` and `baggage` are present in the request. If so, distributed tracing is working.
