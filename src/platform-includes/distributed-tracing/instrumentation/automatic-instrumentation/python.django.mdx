If you run a Django project **distributed tracing works out of the box**.

If requests to your Django project include the `sentry-trace` and `baggage` headers they will be parsed automatically and the headers will also be added to all outgoing HTTP requests from your Django project.

You just need to initialize the Sentry SDK in your `settings.py` file and you are good to go:

```python
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    # ...
)
```

## Configuration

By default trace information (`sentry-trace` and `baggage` headers) will be added to **all** outgoing HTTP requests. If you want to limit to what URLs the trace information should be added you can specify an `trace_propagation_targets` option:

```python
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    trace_propagation_targets=[
        "https://myproject.org",
        r"https://.*\.otherservice.org/.*",
    ],
    # ...
)
```

In this example trace information will be added to all requests to URLs that contain `"https://myproject.org"` or to all ULRs of all sub domains of `otherservice.org` like `https://api.otherservice.org/something/`, `https://payment.otherservice.org/something/` and so on.

See <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#trace-propagation-targets">`trace_propagation_targets` documentation</PlatformLink> for more information about this option.
