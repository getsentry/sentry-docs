If you run a Quart project **distributed tracing works out of the box**.

If requests to your Quart project include the `sentry-trace` and `baggage` headers they will be parsed automatically and the headers will also be added to all outgoing HTTP requests from your Django project.

You need to initialize the Sentry SDK before your app has been initialized and you are good to go:

```python
from quart import Quart
import sentry_sdk


sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    integrations=[
        QuartIntegration(),
    ],
    # ...
)

app = Quart(__name__)
```

<PlatformContent includePath="distributed-tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/configuration/" />

<PlatformContent includePath="distributed-tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/verification/" />
