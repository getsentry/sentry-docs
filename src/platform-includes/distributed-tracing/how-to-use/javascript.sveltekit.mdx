If you're using the current version of our SvelteKit SDK, distributed tracing will work out of the box for the client and server runtimes. To get around possible [Browser CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) issues, you should define `tracePropagationTargets` for client-side.

```js
// hooks.client.js
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [new BrowserTracing()],
  tracePropagationTargets: [
    "https://myproject.org",
    "https://.*.otherservice.org/.*",
  ],
});
```

If you're using version `7.57.x` or below, you'll need to have our <PlatformLink to="/performance/">performance monitoring feature enabled</PlatformLink> for distributed tracing to work.
