If you're using the current version of our React Native SDK distributed tracing will work out of the box.

```js
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  tracePropagationTargets: [
    "https://myproject.org",
    "https://.*.otherservice.org/.*",
  ],
});
```

If you're using version `5.9.x` or below, you'll need to have our <PlatformLink to="/performance/">performance monitoring feature enabled</PlatformLink> in order for distributed tracing to work.
