If you're using the current version of our Cocoa SDK distributed tracing will work out of the box.

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    options.tracePropagationTargets = [
        "https://myproject.org",
        "https://.*.otherservice.org/.*",
    ]
}
```
```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    options.tracePropagationTargets = @[
        @"https://myproject.org",
        @"https://.*.otherservice.org/.*"
    ];
}];
```

If you're using version `8.10.x` or below, you'll need to have our <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#network-tracking">Network Tracking feature enabled</PlatformLink> in order for distributed tracing to work.
