If you're using the current version of our Remix SDK, distributed tracing will work out of the box for the client and server. To get around possible [Browser CORs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) issues, you should define `tracePropagationTargets` for client-side.

```tsx
// entry.client.tsx
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "__DSN__",
  integrations: [new BrowserTracing()],
  tracePropagationTargets: [
    "https://myproject.org",
    "https://.*.otherservice.org/.*",
  ],
});
```

If you're using version `7.57.x` or below, you'll need to have our <PlatformLink to="/performance/">performance monitoring feature enabled</PlatformLink> in order for distributed tracing to work.
