If you're using version `7.58.0` or above of our Node SDK and have the HTTP integration set up, distributed tracing will work out of the box.

<SignInNote />

```js
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [new Sentry.Integrations.Http({ tracing: true })],
});
```

If you're using express or an express-compatible framework, you'll also need to use Sentry middleware:

```js
const app = express();

// RequestHandler creates a separate execution context, so that all
// transactions/spans/breadcrumbs/tags are isolated across requests
app.use(Sentry.Handlers.requestHandler());
// TracingHandler creates a trace for every incoming request
app.use(Sentry.Handlers.tracingHandler());
```

If you're using version `7.57.x` or below, you'll need to have our <PlatformLink to="/performance/">performance monitoring feature enabled</PlatformLink> in order for distributed tracing to work.
