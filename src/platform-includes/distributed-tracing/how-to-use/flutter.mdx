If you're using the current version of our Flutter SDK distributed tracing will work out of the box.

```dart
await SentryFlutter.init((options) {
  options.dsn = '___PUBLIC_DSN___';
  options.tracePropagationTargets.clear();
  options.tracePropagationTargets.addAll(['https://myproject.org', 'https://.*.otherservice.org/.*']);
});
```

If you're using version `7.10.0` or below, you'll need to have our <PlatformLink to="/performance/">performance monitoring feature enabled</PlatformLink> in order for distributed tracing to work.
