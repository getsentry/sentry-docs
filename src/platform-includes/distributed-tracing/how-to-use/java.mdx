If you use the current version of our Java SDK, distributed tracing works automatically with the following frameworks:

- [Spring](/platforms/java/guides/spring/usage/distributed-tracing/#how-to-use-distributed-tracing)
- [Spring Boot](/platforms/java/guides/spring-boot/usage/distributed-tracing/#how-to-use-distributed-tracing)

If you use SDK version `6.24.x` or below, you need to <PlatformLink to="/performance/">Set Up Performance</PlatformLink> monitoring for distributed tracing to work. If you do not want to use performance monitoring, you can instead set up <PlatformLink to="/usage/distributed-tracing/custom-instrumentation/">Custom Instrumentation</PlatformLink> for distributed tracing.
