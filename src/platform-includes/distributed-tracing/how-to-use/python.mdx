If you use the current version of our Python SDK, distributed tracing just works out of the box for the following frameworks:

- [Django](/platforms/python/guides/django/usage/distributed-tracing/#how-to-use-distributed-tracing)
- [FastAPI](/platforms/python/guides/fastapi/usage/distributed-tracing/#how-to-use-distributed-tracing)
- [Flask](/platforms/python/guides/flask/usage/distributed-tracing/#how-to-use-distributed-tracing)
- [Bottle](/platforms/python/guides/bottle/usage/distributed-tracing/#how-to-use-distributed-tracing)
- [Falcon](/platforms/python/guides/falcon/usage/distributed-tracing/#how-to-use-distributed-tracing)
- [Pyramid](/platforms/python/guides/pyramid/usage/distributed-tracing/#how-to-use-distributed-tracing)
- [Quart](/platforms/python/guides/quart/usage/distributed-tracing/#how-to-use-distributed-tracing)
- [Starlette](/platforms/python/guides/starlette/usage/distributed-tracing/#how-to-use-distributed-tracing)
- [Tornado](/platforms/python/guides/tornado/usage/distributed-tracing/#how-to-use-distributed-tracing)

If you however use version `1.25.x` or below, you need to have our <PlatformLink to="/performance/">performance monitoring feature enabled</PlatformLink> for distributed tracing to work. However, if you do not want to activate performance monitoring, you can also setup a <PlatformLink to="/usage/distributed-tracing/custom-instrumentation/">custom instrumentation</PlatformLink>.
