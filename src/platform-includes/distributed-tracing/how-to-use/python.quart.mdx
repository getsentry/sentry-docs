If you use the current version of our Python SDK, distributed tracing just works out of the box. No additional configuration is required.

If you however use version `1.25.x` or below, you need to have our "Performance Monitoring" feature enabled for distributed tracing to work. Learn more in <PlatformLink to="/performance/">Set Up Performance</PlatformLink>.
