Setup the Sentry SDK for all your other connected services. Check the Sentry documentation of the languages your connected services are written in if distributed tracing is supported out of the box, or if you need to do some custom instrumentation.

Maybe you want to check out the Javascript documentation to learn [how to setup distributed tracing in your frontend](/platforms/javascript/performance/connect-services/).
