## Setup Your Other Services

Setup the Sentry SDK for all your other connected services. Check the Sentry documentation of the languages your connected services are written in if distributed tracing is supported out of the box, or if you need to do some custom instrumentation.

Check out the Javascript documentation to learn [how to setup distributed tracing in your frontend](/platforms/javascript/distributed-tracing/#configuration).

### CORS headers

If your frontend project does XHR/fetch requests to your backend you'll need to configure your backend [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Headers) to allow the `sentry-trace` and `baggage` headers. The configuration of your servers response headers might look like `"Access-Control-Allow-Headers: sentry-trace"` and `"Access-Control-Allow-Headers: baggage"`, but the configuration depends on your setup. If you don't allow the `sentry-trace` and `baggage` headers, the request might be blocked.
