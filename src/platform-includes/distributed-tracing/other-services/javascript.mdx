## Setup Your Other Services

If your frontend project does XHR/fetch requests to your backend you'll need to configure your backend [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Headers) to allow the `sentry-trace` and `baggage` headers. The configuration of your servers response headers might look like `"Access-Control-Allow-Headers: sentry-trace"` and `"Access-Control-Allow-Headers: baggage"`, but the configuration depends on your setup. If you don't allow the `sentry-trace` and `baggage` headers, the request might be blocked.
