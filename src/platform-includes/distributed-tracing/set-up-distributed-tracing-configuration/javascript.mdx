## Configuration

To enable distributed tracing, add the `BrowserTracing` integration to your `Sentry.init` options, as described in the Performance <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/">Automatic Instrumentation</PlatformLink> docs. Sentry's [Next.js](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/) and [SvelteKit](/platforms/javascript/guides/sveltekit/) SDKs include this integration by default.

See the instructions at <PlatformLink to="/platforms/javascript/performance/">Set Up Performance</PlatformLink> for more information on how to configure tracing.

Additionally, if your backend is hosted on a different domain, you may need to <PlatformLink to="/distributed-tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#configure-backend-cors-headers">Configure Backend CORS Headers</PlatformLink> to ensure requests aren't blocked.
