## Configuration

There's no additional set up needed to use distributed tracing with the following frameworks: [Django](/platforms/python/guides/django/distributed-tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/), [FastAPI](/platforms/python/guides/fastapi/distributed-tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/), [Flask](/platforms/python/guides/flask/distributed-tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/), [Bottle](/platforms/python/guides/bottle/distributed-tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/), [Falcon](/platforms/python/guides/falcon/distributed-tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/), [Pyramid](/platforms/python/guides/pyramid/distributed-tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/), [Quart](/platforms/python/guides/quart/distributed-tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/), [Starlette](/platforms/python/guides/starlette/distributed-tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/), [Tornado](/platforms/python/guides/tornado/distributed-tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/).

If you have a vanilla Python project or use an unsupported framework you need to implement <PlatformLink to="/distributed-tracing/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation/">Custom Instrumentation</PlatformLink>.

<Alert title="Note" level="note">

In Python SDKs version `1.25.x` and below you need to have "Performance Monitoring" enabled for distributed tracing to work. Learn more in <PlatformLink to="/performance/">Set Up Performance</PlatformLink>.

</Alert>

<!--

TODO: Check these if there is really auto instrumentation:
- AWS Lambda
- GCP
- Trytond
- Celery
- rq
