## Configuration

All Sentry JavaScript SDKs support distributed tracing out of the box if you add the <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/">BrowserTracing</PlatformLink> integration to your `Sentry.init` option. The [Next.js](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/) and [SvelteKit](/platforms/javascript/guides/sveltekit/) SDKs already include this integration by default.

In case your backend lives on a differnt domain, you might need to <PlatformLink to="/distributed-tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#configure-backend-cors-headers">Configure Backend CORS Headers</PlatformLink>.

<Alert title="Note" level="note">

**You need to have "Performance Monitoring" enabled!** See <PlatformLink to="/performance/">Set Up Performance</PlatformLink> on how to enable performance monitoring.
