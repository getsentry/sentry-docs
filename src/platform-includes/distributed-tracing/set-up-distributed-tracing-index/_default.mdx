Distributed tracing is when associating the same trace information to all data that is gathered in your services (like a web frontend, a mobile app, a backend, and some microservices) during a request. This way all the gathered information during that request is visible in a trace. In Sentry a trace looks like this:

(In this example on `pageload` of a Vue app a request to a Python backend is done. The Python backend then calls the `/api` endpoint in a Ruby microservice.)

The trace gives you the complete picture of what was happing in your application as a whole, not just what was happening in one service. (You can drill down into each service from the trace.)

There are two HTTP headers that are used in Sentry to propagate tracing information between services:

- `sentry-trace`
- `baggage`

Make sure that those headers are allow listed in your CORS setup as well as they aren't blocked or stripped by your proxy servers, gateways, or firewalls to ensure distributed tracing works correctly.
