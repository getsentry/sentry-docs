Distributed tracing allows you to collect trace data across services. For example, with distributed tracing you can collect traces that contain data from requests that have passed through your web frontend, mobile app, backend, and microservices.

By following requests across service boundaries, distributed tracing can help you understand what happens across your entire application, in addition to seeing details for each service.

Here's an example showing a distributed trace in Sentry:

![A full distributed trace in Sentry](distributed-trace-in-sentry.png)

This distributed trace shows a Vue app's `pageload` making a request to a Python backend, which then calls the `/api` endpoint of a Ruby microservice.

The trace gives you the complete picture of what was happing in your application as a whole, not just what was happening in one service. (You can drill down into each service from the trace.)

Sentry uses two HTTP headers to propagate tracing information between services:

- `sentry-trace`
- `baggage`

To ensure distributed tracing works correctly, you must add these headers to your CORS allowlist and ensure they aren't blocked or stripped by your proxy servers, gateways, or firewalls.
