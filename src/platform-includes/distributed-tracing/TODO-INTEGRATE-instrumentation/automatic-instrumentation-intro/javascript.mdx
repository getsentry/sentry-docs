To enable distributed tracing, add the `BrowserTracing` integration to your `Sentry.init` options, as described in the Performance <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/"> Automatic Instrumentation</PlatformLink> docs. The [Next.js](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/) and [SvelteKit](/platforms/javascript/guides/sveltekit/) SDKs include this integration by default.

Tracing information sent from the backend via the `sentry-tracing` and `baggage` HTML `meta` tags will be extracted and stored in a transaction that is created at page load.

The `sentry-trace` and `baggage` headers will be added to all your outgoing XHR/fetch requests.
