## Set Up Other Services

For distributed tracing to work, you must enable it in all your connected services. To do this, follow the Distributed Tracing setup docs for each of the languages your connected services are written in. Some SDKs support distributed tracing without additional set up and some require custom instrumentation.

To connect a JavaScript frontend, follow the [Automatic Instrumentation](/platforms/javascript/distributed-tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/) configuration docs.
