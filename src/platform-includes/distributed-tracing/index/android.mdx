### HTTP and GraphQL Requests

For traces that begin in the mobile app, any requests made (and any requests your backend makes as a result) are linked through the request header `sentry-trace`.

The Sentry Android SDK offers [OkHttp](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/okhttp/) and [Apollo](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/apollo/) integrations for HTTP and GraphQL requests respectively.

These integrations either generate or pick up and propagate the trace header automatically, as appropriate, for all transactions and spans that they generate.
