All Sentry JavaScript SDKs support distributed tracing out of the box if you add the <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/">BrowserTracing</PlatformLink> integration to your `Sentry.init` option. The [Next.js](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/) and [SvelteKit](/platforms/javascript/guides/sveltekit/) SDKs already include this integration by default.

See <PlatformLink to="/distributed-tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/">Automatic Instrumentation</PlatformLink> to learn more.
