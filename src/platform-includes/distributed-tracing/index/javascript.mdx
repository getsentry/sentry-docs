All of Sentry's tracing-related integrations (`BrowserTracing`, `Http`, and `Express`), as well as the [Next.JS SDK](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/), support distributed tracing out of the box.

In the rare case that you want to implement distributed tracing for your own Javascript framework see <PlatformLink to="/distributed-tracing/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation/">Custom Instrumentation</PlatformLink>.
