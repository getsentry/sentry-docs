Using `SentrySDK:configureScope` lets you set context data globally, which will be attached to all future events.

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.configureScope { scope in
    scope.setTag(value: "my-tag", key: "my value")
    let user = User()
    user.email = "john.doe@example.com"
    scope.setUser(user)
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
import Sentry

[SentrySDK configureScope:^(SentryScope * _Nonnull scope) {
    [scope setTagValue:@"my-tag" forKey:@"my value"];
    SentryUser *user = [[SentryUser alloc] init];
    user.email = @"john.doe@example.com";
    [scope setUser:user];
}];
```

### Passing a Scope Instance {#scope-pass}

Setting an instance of Scope is helpful when you want to completely control what should be attached to the event.

<PlatformContent includePath="pass-scope" />

### Using Scope Callback {#scope-callback}

To maintain global state, but mutate context data for one capture call, use the Scope callback:

<PlatformContent includePath="scope-callback" />
