### Scope Synchronization

If you want to set context data in the Java layer, then receive that context data when a native (C/C++) crash happens, you need to synchronize the Java `Scope` with the native `Scope`. This feature was introduced in version `3.0.0` of the Android SDK and requires an opt-in:

```xml {filename:AndroidManifest.xml}
<application>
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.ndk.scope-sync.enable" android:value="true" />
</application>
```
