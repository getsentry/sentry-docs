In Rails, being able to serve dynamic (e.g. `.html.erb`) pages in response to errors is required in order to pass the needed `event_id` to the JavaScript SDK. Normally, this looks like overwriting the `config.exceptions_app` setting to point at your own router, and then calling your own controller to handle the error. Several tutorials or gems exist to allow for this.

Once you are able to serve dynamic exception pages, supporting user feedback is straightforward.

Make sure you've got the JavaScript SDK available:

```ERB
<script
  src="https://browser.sentry-cdn.com/{{ packages.version('sentry.javascript.browser') }}/bundle.min.js"
  integrity="sha384-{{ packages.checksum('sentry.javascript.browser', 'bundle.min.js', 'sha384-base64') }}"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
></script>
```

And the template that brings up the dialog:

```ERB
<% sentry_id = request.env["sentry.error_event_id"] %>
<% if sentry_id.present? %>
<script>
  Sentry.init({ dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___" });
  Sentry.showReportDialog({ eventId: "<%= sentry_id %>" });
</script>
<% end %>
```
