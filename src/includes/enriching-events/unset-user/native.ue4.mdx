Create a new `__sentry` config object without the `"user"` field. Then, call `FGenericCrashContext::SetGameData` from the [initialization function](/platforms/native/guides/ue4/advanced-config/) with the new JSON data. You have to provide all other fields again, as call overrides the previously registered data.
