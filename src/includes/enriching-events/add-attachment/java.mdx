To add an attachment, you can either add it to the scope, pass it to any of the `capture` methods, or manipulate the list of attachments in an `EventProcessor` or `beforeSend`.


### Passing Attachments to Capture

You may pass attachments to any of the `capture` methods, for example, when capturing an exception:

```java
import io.sentry.Attachment;
import io.sentry.Hint;
import io.sentry.Sentry;

Sentry.captureException(new IllegalStateException(), Hint.withAttachment("/path/to/file.txt"))
```

```kotlin
import io.sentry.Attachment;
import io.sentry.Hint;
import io.sentry.Sentry;

Sentry.captureException(IllegalStateException(), Hint.withAttachment("/path/to/file.txt"))
```


### Adding Attachments in `EventProcessor`

You may also manipulate attachments in `EventProcessor`:

```java
import io.sentry.Attachment;
import io.sentry.EventProcessor;
import io.sentry.Hint;
import io.sentry.Sentry;
import io.sentry.SentryEvent;
import io.sentry.protocol.Message;

public class MyClass {
  public void myMethod() {
    // Add an `EventProcessor` to the current scope. Note that
    // this helper will process *all* future events in this scope.
    Sentry.configureScope(scope -> {
      scope.addEventProcessor(new EventProcessor() {
        @Override
        public SentryEvent process(SentryEvent event, Hint hint) {
          hint.addAttachment(new Attachment("/path/to/file.txt"))
          return event;
        }
      });
    });

    // Send an event to Sentry. During construction of the event
    // the attachment will be added by the event processor.
    Sentry.captureMessage("Hello, world!");
  }
}
```

```kotlin
import io.sentry.Attachment;
import io.sentry.EventProcessor;
import io.sentry.Hint;
import io.sentry.Sentry
import io.sentry.SentryEvent;
import io.sentry.protocol.Message

class MyClass {
  fun myMethod() {
    // Add an `EventProcessor` to the current scope. Note that
    // this helper will process *all* future events in this scope.
    Sentry.configureScope { scope ->
      scope.addEventProcessor(object: EventProcessor {
        override fun process(event: SentryEvent, hint: Hint): SentryEvent? {
          hint.addAttachment(Attachment("/path/to/file.txt"))
          return event
        }
      })
    }

    // Send an event to Sentry. During construction of the event
    // the attachment will be added by the event processor.
    Sentry.captureMessage("Hello, world!")
  }
}
```


### Adding Attachments in `beforeSend`

Another way of adding attachments is using `beforeSend`:

```java
import io.sentry.Attachment;
import io.sentry.Hint;
import io.sentry.Sentry;

Sentry.init(options -> {
  options.setBeforeSend((event, hint) -> {
    hint.addAttachment(new Attachment("/path/to/file.txt"))
    return event;
  });
});
```

```kotlin
import io.sentry.Attachment;
import io.sentry.Hint;
import io.sentry.Sentry;
import io.sentry.SentryOptions.BeforeSendCallback

Sentry.init { options ->
  options.beforeSend = BeforeSendCallback { event, hint ->
    hint.addAttachment(Attachment("/path/to/file.txt"))
    event
  }
}
```
