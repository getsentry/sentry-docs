The `configureScope` helper will setup the scope for all events being captured by the Sentry SDK.

```php
\Sentry\configureScope(function (\Sentry\State\Scope $scope): void {
    $scope->setContext('character', [
        'name' => 'Mighty Fighter',
        'age' => 19,
        'attack_type' => 'melee'
    ]);
});
```

If you need to modify the scope for a single event, you can use the `withScope` helper instead, which does not keep the scope changes made.

```php
\Sentry\withScope(function (\Sentry\State\Scope $scope) use ($e): void {
    $scope->setContext('character', [
        'name' => 'Mighty Fighter',
        'age' => 19,
        'attack_type' => 'melee'
    ]);

    \Sentry\captureMessage('The fighter is out of energy!');
    // or: \Sentry\captureException($e);
});
```
