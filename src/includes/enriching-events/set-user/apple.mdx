```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

let user = User()
user.email = "john.doe@example.com"
SentrySDK.setUser(user)
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

SentryUser *user = [[SentryUser alloc] init];
user.email = @"john.doe@example.com";
[SentrySDK setUser:user];
```

<Note>

Since 6.0.1: If you do not provide a user identity, the SDK falls back to `installationId`, which the SDK randomly generates once during an app's installation.
