<Note>

Sentry's Android SDK reports an error automatically whenever a thrown exception goes uncaught in your application causing the application to crash.

The SDK builds a crash report that persists to disk and tries to send the report right after the crash. Since the environment may be unstable at the crash time, the report is guaranteed to send once the application is started again. This process for sending a report is true if there is a fatal error in your native code as well as for the NDK. In addition, the NDK is not only catching unhandled exceptions but is also set as a signal handler to react to signals from the OS.

**Features:**

- The Native Development Kit (NDK), the set of tools that that allows you to use C and C++ code with Android, is packed with the SDK.
- Events [enriched](/platforms/android/enriching-events/context/) with device data
- Offline caching when a device is offline; we send a report once we receive another event
- [Breadcrumbs automatically](/platforms/android/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/#automatic-breadcrumbs) captured for:
    - Android activity lifecycle events
    - Application lifecycle events (lifecycle of the application process)
    - System events (low battery, low storage space, airplane mode started, shutdown, changes of the configuration, and so forth)
    - App. component callbacks
- [Release Health](/product/releases/health/) tracks crash free users and sessions
- [Attachments](/platforms/android/enriching-events/attachments/) enrich your event by storing additional files, such as config or log files.
- [User Feedback](/platforms/android/enriching-events/user-feedback/) provides the abiity to collect user information when an event occurs.
- [Performance Monitoring](/product/performance/) creates transactions
- [Application Not Responding (ANR)](/platforms/android/configuration/app-not-respond/) reported if the application is blocked for more than five seconds
- Code samples provided in both Kotlin and Java as the Android SDK uses both languages
- We provide a [sample application](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/tree/master/sentry-samples/sentry-samples-android) for our Android users
- Our [video tutorial](/platforms/android/android-video/) visually demonstrates how to set up our SDK
