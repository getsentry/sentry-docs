<Note>

*Sentry's Android SDK reports an error automatically whenever a thrown exception goes uncaught in your application causing the application to crash.*

*The SDK builds a crash report that persists to disk and tries to send the report right after the crash; however, because the environment may be unstable at the crash time, the report is guaranteed to send once the application is started again. This process for sending a report is true if there is a fatal error in your native code as well as for the NDK. In addition, the NDK is not only catching unhandled exceptions but is also set as a signal handler to react to signals from the OS.*
