<Note>

_The `sentry-log4j2` library provides [Log4j 2.x](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/) support for Sentry via an [Appender](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/log4j-core/apidocs/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/Appender.html) that sends logged exceptions to Sentry._

</Note>

Once the integration is configured you can _also_ use Sentryâ€™s static API, [as shown on the usage page](usage/), in order to do things like record breadcrumbs, set the current user, or manually send events. The source can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/tree/master/sentry-log4j2).
