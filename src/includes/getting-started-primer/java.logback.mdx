<Note>

_The `sentry-logback` library provides [Logback](https://logback.qos.ch/) support for Sentry using an [Appender](https://logback.qos.ch/apidocs/ch/qos/logback/core/Appender.html) that sends logged exceptions to Sentry._

</Note>

Once this integration is configured you can _also_ use Sentry’s static API, [as shown on the usage page](usage/), in order to do things like record breadcrumbs, set the current user, or manually send events. The source can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/tree/master/sentry-logback).
