<Note>

_Sentry's Next.js SDK enables automatic reporting of errors and exceptions._

</Note>

Features:

- Automatic [Error Tracking](/product/issues/) with source maps for both JavaScript and TypeScript
- Events [enriched](/platforms/javascript/enriching-events/context/) with device data
- [Breadcrumbs](/platforms/javascript/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/) created for outgoing HTTP request with XHR and Fetch, and console logs
- [Release Health](/product/releases/health/) for tracking crash-free users and sessions

Under the hood the SDK relies on our [React SDK](/platforms/javascript/guides/react/) on the frontend and [Node SDK](/platforms/node) on the backend, which makes all features available in those SDKs also available in this SDK.

<Alert level="info" title="Early Adopter">

The SDK is in the early stages of being released. This means changes are possible and may prevent the SDK from working as expected. We recognize the irony.
