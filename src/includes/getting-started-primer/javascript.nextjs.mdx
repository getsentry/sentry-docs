<Note>

Currently, the Sentry Next.js SDK supports Next.js versions `10.0.8` - `11.1.3`. The SDK may work with some projects using Next.js 12, but it is not yet officially supported.

</Note>

The Sentry Next.js SDK automatically catches errors and collects performance data from your app.

Features:

- Automatic [Error Tracking](/product/issues/) with source maps for both JavaScript and TypeScript
- Events [enriched](/platforms/javascript/enriching-events/context/) with device data
- [Breadcrumbs](/platforms/javascript/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/) created for outgoing HTTP request with XHR and Fetch, and console logs
- [Release Health](/product/releases/health/) for tracking crash-free users and sessions
- Automatic [Performance Monitoring](/product/performance/) for both the client and server, from version `6.5.0`

Under the hood the SDK relies on our [React SDK](/platforms/javascript/guides/react/) on the frontend and [Node SDK](/platforms/node) on the backend, which makes all features available in those SDKs also available in this SDK.
However, using a [custom server](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-server) is not currently supported.
