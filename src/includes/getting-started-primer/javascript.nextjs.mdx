<Note>

Sentry's Next.js SDK enables automatic reporting of errors and exceptions.

</Note>

Currently, the minimum Next.js supported version is `10.0.8`.

Features:

- Automatic [Error Tracking](/product/issues/) with source maps for both JavaScript and TypeScript
- Events [enriched](/platforms/javascript/enriching-events/context/) with device data
- [Breadcrumbs](/platforms/javascript/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/) created for outgoing HTTP request with XHR and Fetch, and console logs
- [Release Health](/product/releases/health/) for tracking crash-free users and sessions
- Automatic [Performance Monitoring](/product/performance/) for both the client and server, from version `6.5.0`

Under the hood the SDK relies on our [React SDK](/platforms/javascript/guides/react/) on the frontend and [Node SDK](/platforms/node) on the backend, which makes all features available in those SDKs also available in this SDK.

<Alert level="info" title="Early Adopter">

We are working to resolve [this issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/3643) in Vercel production environments. The SDK is currently unable to pick up errors and/or transactions when calling serverless API routes.
