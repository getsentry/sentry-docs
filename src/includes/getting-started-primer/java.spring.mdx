<Note>

_Sentry's integration with [Spring](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework) supports Spring Framework 5.1.2 and above to report unhandled exceptions and optional user information. If you're on an older version, use [our legacy integration](/platforms/java/legacy/spring/)._

The `sentry-spring` library can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/tree/master/sentry-spring):

- Provides a [HandlerExceptionResolver](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/4.3.9.RELEASE/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/HandlerExceptionResolver.html) to send unhandled exceptions to Sentry
- Attaches HTTP request information to every `SentryEvent` recorded within the scope of the request
- Provides the ability to [record user information](/platforms/java/guides/spring/advanced-usage/)

To use Sentry with <strong>Spring Boot</strong>, we recommend using Sentry [Spring Boot integration](/platforms/java/guides/spring-boot) as it provides richer configuration capabilities.
