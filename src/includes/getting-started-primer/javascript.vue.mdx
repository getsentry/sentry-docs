<Note>

Sentry's Vue SDK enables automatic reporting of errors and exceptions. It targets Vue version `2.x`. Support for `3.x` is tracked by [GitHub issue #2925](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/2925).

The SDK will capture the name and props state of the active component where the error was thrown. This is reported via Vueâ€™s `config.errorHandler` hook.
