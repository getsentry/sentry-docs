_Sentry's Python SDK enables automatic reporting of errors and exceptions as well as identifies perfomance issues in your application._

Sentry's Python SDK includes powerful hooks that let you get more out of Sentry, and helps you bind data like tags, users, or contexts. Our SDK supports Python 2.7, then 3.4 and above; specific versions for each framework are documented on the respective framework page. Migrating from older versions is documented [here](./migration/).
