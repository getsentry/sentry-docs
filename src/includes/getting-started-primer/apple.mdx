**Features using Swizzling:**

The Cocoa SDK uses [swizzling](https://nshipster.com/method-swizzling/) to provide some features out of the box without boilerplate code. The following features use swizzling:



Since Cocoa <= 7.5.0, you can opt out of swizzling using options. When disabling swizzling, the SDK disables the features above:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    options.enableSwizzling = false
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    options.enableSwizzling = NO;
}];
```
