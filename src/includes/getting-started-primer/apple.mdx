<Note>

*Sentry's SDKs report an error automatically whenever a thrown error or exception goes uncaught in your application causing the application to crash. Sentry's iOS, tvOS, and watchOS SDK hook into all signal and exception handlers, except for MacOS.*

*The SDK builds a crash report that persists to disk and tries to send the report right after the crash. Since the environment may be unstable at the crash time, the report is guaranteed to send once the application is started again.*

</Note>

**Features:**

- Events [enriched](/platforms/apple/enriching-events/context/) with device data
- Offline caching when a device is offline; we send a report once we receive another event
- [Breadcrumbs automatically](/platforms/apple/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/#automatic-breadcrumbs) captured for
  - Application lifecycle events (didBecomeActive, didEnterBackground, viewDidAppear)
  - Touch events
  - System events (battery level or state changed, memory warnings, device orientation changed, keyboard did show and did hide, screenshot taken)
- [Release Health](/product/releases/health/) tracks crash free users and sessions
- [Attachments](/platforms/apple/enriching-events/attachments/) enrich your event by storing additional files, such as config or log files
- [User Feedback](/platforms/apple/enriching-events/user-feedback/) provides the abiity to collect user information when an event occurs

<Alert>

If you're using a version of the SDK between 6.0.2 and 6.0.8, we **highly recommend** upgrading to the latest version to avoid [a regression](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/pull/786) that affected the quality of the stack traces and error messages.

If you're using self-hosted Sentry, as of version 6.0.0 of the SDK, version 20.6.0 of self-hosted Sentry or greater is required.
