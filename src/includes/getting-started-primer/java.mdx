_Sentry's Java SDK enables capturing sessions for Release Health as well as reporting messages and errors._

Sentry for Java is a collection of modules provided by Sentry; it supports Java 1.8 and above. At its core, Sentry for Java provides a raw client for sending events to Sentry. To begin, we **highly recommend** you use one of the logging libraries or framework integrations.

<!-- TODO: add version and value information, similar to what we have for Go:

Our Go SDK supports all recent versions of the language, and integrates well with a variety of popular frameworks and packages in the Go ecosystem. It gives developers helpful hints for where and why an error or panic might have occurred. -->
