Our Unity SDK builds on top of the [.NET SDK](/platforms/dotnet/) and extends it with Unity specific features. It gives developers helpful hints for where and why an error or performance issue might have occurred.

**Additional Features:**

- [Native support](/platforms/unity/native-support/) for automatic crash error tracking by using the
  - [iOS SDK](/platforms/apple/guides/ios/) to support Objective-C, Swift, C and C++
  - [Android SDK](/platforms/android/) to support Java, Kotlin, C and C++
- [Offline caching](/platforms/unity/configuration/options/#cache-directory-path) stores event data to disk in case the device is not online
- [Release Health](/platforms/unity/configuration/releases/) to keep track of crash free users and sessions
- [Breadcrumbs automatically](/platforms/unity/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/#automatic-breadcrumbs) captured for
  - Unity's `Debug.Log` and `Debug.LogWarning`
  - Scene load, unload, active change
