Our Unity SDK builds on top of the [.NET SDK](/platforms/dotnet/) and extends it with Unity specific features. It gives developers helpful hints for where and why an error or performance issue might have occurred.

**Additional Features:**

- [Offline caching](/platforms/unity/configuration/offline-caching/) when a device is unable to connect; we send a report once we receive another event
- [Breadcrumbs automatically](/platforms/unity/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/#automatic-breadcrumbs) captured for
  - Unity's `Debug.Log` and `Debug.LogWarning`
  - Scene load, unload, active change
- [Event debouncing](/platforms/unity/configuration/event-debouncing/) to handle high amounts of log output i.e. during `Update`
