Our Unity SDK builds on top of the [.NET SDK](/platforms/dotnet/) and extends it with Unity specific features. It gives developers helpful hints for where and why an error or performance issue might have occurred.

**Additional Features:**

- Unity's `Debug.Log` and `Debug.LogWarning` get captured with [breadcrumbs](/product/issues/issue-details/breadcrumbs/)
- Scene loading and unloading get captured with [breadcrumbs](/product/issues/issue-details/breadcrumbs/)
- [Event debouncing](/platforms/unity/configuration/event-debouncing/) to handle high amounts of log output i.e. during `Update`
