Our .NET SDK supports all recent versions of the platform, and integrates well with a variety of popular frameworks and packages in the ecosystem. It gives developers helpful hints for where and why an error or performance issue might have occurred.

The main [Sentry NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sentry) targets .NET Standard 2.0. [Our legacy SDK](/clients/csharp/) supports .NET Framework as early as 3.5. Read more about [compatibility and unit testing](./unit-testing.mdx).
