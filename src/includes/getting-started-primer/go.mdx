_Sentry's Go SDK enables reporting messages, errors and panics._

Our Go SDK supports Go Modules by design. When installed, it picks up the latest version of the SDK and stores it inside the `go.mod` file. Non-major changes should never break your builds. The SDK supports all recent versions of the language, utilizes its features, and gives developers the most helpful hints possible for where and why the error might have occurred.
