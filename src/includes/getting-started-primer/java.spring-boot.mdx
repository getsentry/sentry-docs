<Note>

_Sentry's integration with [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) supports Spring Boot 2.1.0 and above to report unhandled exceptions as well as release and registration of beans. If you're on an older version, use [our legacy integration](/platforms/java/legacy/spring/)._

The `sentry-spring-boot-starter` library enhances [Sentry Spring](/platforms/java/guides/spring/) to:

- manage a fine-grained configuration using `application.properties` or `application.yaml`
- automatically include the release when [Spring Boot Git integration is configured](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto.html#howto-git-info)
- automatically register `BeforeSendCallback`, `BeforeBreadcrumbCallback`, `EventProcessor`, `Integration` beans
