<Note>

Sentry's Dart SDK enables automatic reporting of errors, messages, and exceptions. The SDK is available on GitHub [`sentry-dart`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dart/). For Flutter apps, refer to [our Flutter documentation](/platforms/flutter) instead.

Features:

- Breadcrumbs automatically captured:
  - by the [Dart SDK](/platforms/dart/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/#automatic-breadcrumbs)
  - as well as `http` with the [Dart SDK](/platforms/dart/)
