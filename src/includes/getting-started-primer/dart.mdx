<Note>

Sentry's Dart SDK enables automatic reporting of errors, messages, and exceptions. The SDK is available on GitHub [`sentry-dart`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dart/). For Flutter apps, refer to [our Flutter documentation](/platforms/flutter) instead.

**Features:**

- Events [enriched](/platforms/dart/enriching-events/context/) with device data
- Breadcrumbs automatically captured:
  - by the [Dart SDK](/platforms/dart/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/#automatic-breadcrumbs)
  - as well as `http` with the [Dart SDK](/platforms/dart/)
- [Release Health](/product/releases/health/) tracks crash free users and sessions
- [Attachments](/platforms/dart/enriching-events/attachments/) enrich your event by storing additional files, such as config or log files.
- [User Feedback](/platforms/dart/enriching-events/user-feedback/) provides the ability to collect user information when an event occurs.
