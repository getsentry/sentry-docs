<Note>

Sentry's Remix SDK enables automatic reporting of errors and exceptions, as well as the performance metrics for both client and server side operations.

</Note>

## Features Overview

- [Error Tracking](/product/issues/) with source maps for both JavaScript and TypeScript
- Events [enriched](/platforms/javascript/guides/remix/enriching-events/context/) with device data
- [Breadcrumbs](/platforms/javascript/guides/remix/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/) created for outgoing HTTP request with XHR and Fetch, and console logs
- [Release health](/product/releases/health/) for tracking crash-free users and sessions
- [Performance Monitoring](/product/performance/) for both the client and server

Under the hood, Remix SDK relies on our [React SDK](/platforms/javascript/guides/react/) on the frontend and [Node SDK](/platforms/node) on the backend, which makes all features available in those SDKs also available in this SDK.

## SDK Status
