<Note>

Sentry's React Native SDK enables automatic reporting of errors and exceptions, and identifies performance issues in your application. The React Native SDK includes performance monitoring (our `@sentry/tracing` package) by default.

</Note>

Features:

- Automatic Native Crash [Error Tracking](/product/issues/) (using both `sentry-cocoa` & `sentry-android`)
- Offline storage of events
- Events [enriched](/platforms/react-native/enriching-events/context/) with device data
- [Autolinking](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2019/07/03/version-60#native-modules-are-now-autolinked)
- [Breadcrumbs](/platforms/react-native/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/) created for outgoing `http` request with XHR and Fetch; UI and system events; and console logs
- [Release Health](/product/releases/health/) tracks crash free users and sessions
- [Performance Monitoring](/product/performance/) creates transactions automatically for React Navigation v4 and v5; creates spans automatically for XHR and Fetch
- Under the hood the SDK relies on our [JavaScript SDK](/platforms/javascript/), which makes all functions available for JavaScript also available in this SDK
- On Device symbolication for JavaScript (in Debug)
- [RAM bundle support](/platforms/react-native/manual-setup/ram-bundles/)
- [Hermes support](/platforms/react-native/manual-setup/hermes/)
