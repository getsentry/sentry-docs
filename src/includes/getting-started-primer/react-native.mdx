<Note>

_Sentry's React Native SDK enables automatic reporting of errors and exceptions, and identifies perfomance issues in your application. The React Native SDK includes performance monitoring (our `@sentry/tracing` package) by default._

- [Error monitoring](/product/error-monitoring/): captures errors in both JavaScript and native layers
- [Breadcrumbs:](/platforms/react-native/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/) created for outgoing `http` request with XHR and Fetch; UI and system events; and console logs
- [Release Health:](product/releases/health/) tracks crash free users and sessions
- [Performance Monitoring:](/product/performance/) creates transactions automatically for React Navigation v4 and v5; creates spans automatically for XHR and Fetch
- Under the hood the SDK relies on our [JavaScript SDK](/platforms/javascript/). That means that all functions available for JavaScript are also available in this SDK.

Migrating from older versions is documented [here](./migration/).
