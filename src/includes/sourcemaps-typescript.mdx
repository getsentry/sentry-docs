This guide is only applicable if you're using `tsc` to compile your project. If you use another tool (such as Webpack) in combination with TypeScript, you'll most likely want to follow that guide instead.

## 1. Generate Source Maps

First, configure the TypeScript compiler to output source maps:

```json {filename:tsconfig.json}
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "sourceMap": true,
    "inlineSources": true,

    // Set `sourceRoot` to  `/` to strip the build path prefix from
    // generated source code references. This allows Sentry to match source files
    // relative to your source root folder.
    "sourceRoot": "/"
  }
}
```
