This guide is only applicable if you're using `tsc` to compile your project. If you use another tool (such as webpack) in combination with TypeScript, you'll most likely want to follow that guide instead.

## Automatic Setup

The easiest way to configure uploading source maps with `tsc` and `sentry-cli` is by using the Sentry Wizard:

<Include name="sourcemaps-wizard-instructions.mdx" />

If you want to configure source maps upload manually instead, follow the steps below.

## Manual Setup

### 1. Generate Source Maps

First, configure the TypeScript compiler to output source maps:

```json {filename:tsconfig.json}
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "sourceMap": true,
    "inlineSources": true,

    // Set `sourceRoot` to  "/" to strip the build path prefix from
    // generated source code references. This will improve issue grouping in Sentry.
    "sourceRoot": "/"
  }
}
```

<Include name="sentry-cli-sourcemaps.mdx" />

## Dealing with TSLib

During compilation, if needed, TypeScript will inject some of its runtime dependencies into the output files it produces. It can include things like polyfills for function generators or some APIs not available in all the environments.

However, this makes it impossible to map frames from compiled code to the original sources, as there are no original sources.

We can still make it work, though. To do this, we need to tell the TypeScript compiler not to inject those code snippets and use its own 3rd party package called `tslib`, which is internally the part of a compiler.

The only things that have to change are inside the TypeScript config file, not your source code.

First, make sure that `tslib` is listed as the dependency in your `package.json` file. Once that's done, add two entries in `compilerOptions` section of your `tsconfig.json`. `"noEmitHelpers": true` and `"importHelpers": true`. That's it. Now, we can correctly map the source maps for all your stack trace frames, including internal TypeScript compiler code snippets.
