```swift
let error = NSError(domain: "", code: 0, userInfo: [NSLocalizedDescriptionKey : "Object does not exist"])
SentrySDK.capture(error: error) { (scope) in
    // Changes in here will only be captured for this event
    // The scope in this callback is a clone of the current scope
    // It contains all data but mutations only influence the event being sent
    scope.setTag(value: "value", key: "myTag")
}
```

```objc
NSError *error = [[NSError alloc] initWithDomain:@"" code:0 userInfo:@{
    NSLocalizedDescriptionKey: @"Object does not exist"
}];

    // The scope in this callback is a clone of the current scope
    // It contains all data but mutations only influence the event being sent
