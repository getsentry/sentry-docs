The React Native SDK ensures all Sentry events are accounted for in the event of a hard crash. This is done by prolonging the process until all events are successfully stored on the device's disk. The events will then be sent the next time the application is open.

You can manually flush all events to disk by calling `Sentry.flush()`.
