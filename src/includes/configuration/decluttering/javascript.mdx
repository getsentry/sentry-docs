### Decluttering Sentry

You can construct an allowed list of domains which might raise acceptable exceptions. For example, if your scripts are loaded from `cdn.example.com` and your site is `example.com`, you can set `allowUrls` to:

You can also use `denyUrls` if you want to block specific URLs forever.

<Alert level="warning" title="Note"><markdown>

Prior to version 5.17.0, `allowUrls` and `denyUrls` were called `whitelistUrls` and `blacklistUrls` respectively. These options are still supported for backwards compatibility reasons, but they will be removed in version 6.0. For more information, please see our [Inclusive Language Policy](https://develop.sentry.dev/inclusion/).

Additionally, our community has compiled a list of common ignore rules for everyday things, like Facebook, Chrome extensions, and so forth. It's useful and recommended to check these out and see if they apply to you. [Here is the original gist](https://gist.github.com/impressiver/5092952). This is not the default value of our SDK; it's just a highlight of an extensive example.

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  ignoreErrors: [
    // Random plugins/extensions
