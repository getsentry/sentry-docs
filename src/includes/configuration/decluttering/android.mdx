### Decluttering Sentry

When used together with one of the logging framework integrations, the Android SDK captures all error logs as events. If you see a particular kind of error very often that has a `logger` tag, you can ignore that particular logger entirely. For more information see our <Link to="/platforms/android/integrations/timber/">Timber</Link> integration.
