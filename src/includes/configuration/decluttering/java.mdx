### Decluttering Sentry

When used together with one of the logging framework integrations, the Java SDK captures all error logs as events. If you see a particular kind of error very often that has a `logger` tag, you can ignore that particular logger entirely. For more information see our <Link to="/platforms/java/guides/logback/">Logback</Link> or <Link to="/platforms/java/guides/log4j2/">Log4j 2.x</Link> integration.
