We create a session for every page load. For single-page applications, we will create a new session for every navigation change (History API). 

We mark the session as crashed if an _unhandled error_ or _unhandled promise rejection_ bubbled up to the global handler.

We mark the session as an error if the SDK captures an event that contains an exception (this includes manually captured errors). 

By default, the JavaScript SDKs are sending sessions, to disable this toggle the flag `autoSessionTracking` to `false`:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  autoSessionTracking: false // default: true
});
```
