We create a session for every page load. For single-page applications, we will create a new session for every navigation change (History API).

We mark the session as:
- crashed if an _unhandled error_ or _unhandled promise rejection_ bubbled up to the global handler.
- an error if the SDK captures an event that contains an exception (this includes manually captured errors).

To receive data on user adoption, such as users crash free rate percentage, and the number of users that have adopted a specific release, set the user on the [`initialScope`](/platforms/javascript/configuration/options/#initial-scope) when initializing the SDK.

By default, the JavaScript SDKs are sending sessions. To disable sending sessions, set the `autoSessionTracking` flag to `false`:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  autoSessionTracking: false // default: true
});
```
