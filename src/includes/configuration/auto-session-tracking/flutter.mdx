By default, the session is terminated once the application is in the background for more than 30 seconds. You can change the time out with the option named `sessionTrackingIntervalMillis`. It takes the amount in milliseconds. For example, to configure it to be 60 seconds:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  await SentryFlutter.init(
    (options) => options.autoSessionTrackingIntervalMillis = 60000
    appRunner: () => runApp(MyApp()),
  );
}
```

If you'd like to opt-out of this feature, you can do it via options.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  await SentryFlutter.init(
    (options) => options.enableAutoSessionTracking = true, // it's enabled by default
    appRunner: () => runApp(MyApp()),
  );
}
```
