To benefit from the health data, you must use at least version 0.4.0 of the Native SDK.

Release health is captured, by default, unless you specifically disabled collecting it in the initialization options for the SDK.

The SDK automatically starts a new session when it is initialized via `sentry_init`, and will end that session automatically when the SDK is shut down via `sentry_shutdown`, or explicitly by calling `sentry_end_session`.

The SDK currently tracks only one concurrent session and will end the running session when using `sentry_start_session`. If you prefer to start sessions manually, consider disabling automatic session tracking during initialization:

```c
sentry_options_t *options = sentry_options_new();
sentry_options_set_release(options, "my-project-name@2.3.12");
sentry_options_set_auto_session_tracking(options, 0);
sentry_init(options);

// ...

sentry_start_session();
// Operations covered by the session go here.
sentry_end_session();
```
