<PlatformContent includePath="configuration/auto-session-tracking/dotnet" />

Sentry SDK subscribes to `OnApplicationPause` and `OnApplicationFocus` events to track if the application has focus or if it has been put in the background. On resume within `AutoSessionTrackingInterval` the session will be continued. The default value is `30 seconds`. Otherwise, the previous session will be ended and we create a new one.

```csharp {tabTitle:C#}
using System;
using Sentry;

// Add this to the SDK initialization callback
options.AutoSessionTrackingInterval = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30);
```
