<Alert level="warning" title="Note">

The native support is currently limited to the configuration via the editor window. This is due to the SDK relying on the configuration options to be available at build time to set up the Android and iOS SDKs.
  
</Alert>

We are providing the helper class `SentryUnity` to allow for programmatic configuration of the SDK. You can set options by passing a callback to the `Init()` method, which will pass the option object along for modifications:

```csharp
using Sentry.Unity;

SentryUnity.Init(o =>
{
    o.Dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    // Useful when setting things up to see the SDK logs in the Unity console.
    o.Debug = true;
});
```
<Note>

To prevent the SDK from initializing itself, make sure to disable Sentry in the configuration window.
