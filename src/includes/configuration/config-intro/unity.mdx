We are providing the helper class `SentryUnity` to allow for programmatic configuration of the SDK. You can set options by passing a callback to the `Init()` method, which will pass the option object along for modifications:

```csharp
using Sentry.Unity;

SentryUnity.Init(o =>
{
    o.Dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    // Useful when setting things up to see the SDK logs in the Unity console.
    o.Debug = true;
});
```
<Note>

To prevent the SDK from initializing itself, make sure to disable Sentry in the configuration window.
