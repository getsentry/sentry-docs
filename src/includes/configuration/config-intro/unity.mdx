We are providing the helper class `SentryUnity` to allow for programmatic configuration of the SDK. You can set options by passing a callback to the `Init()` method which will
pass the option object along for modifications:

```csharp
using Sentry.Unity;

SentryUnity.Init(o =>
{
    o.Dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    o.MaxBreadcrumbs = 50;
    o.Debug = true;
});
```
