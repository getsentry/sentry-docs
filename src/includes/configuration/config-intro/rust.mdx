Options are passed to the `init()` function as tuple where the first argument is the DSN and the second the options:

Additionally, the `release_name` macro automatically generates the expected release based on the cargo metadata.

```rust
let _guard = sentry::init(("___PUBLIC_DSN___", sentry::ClientOptions {
    release: sentry::release_name!(),
    max_breadcrumbs: 50,
    debug: true, // <- this should only be used during development
    ..Default::default()
}));
```
