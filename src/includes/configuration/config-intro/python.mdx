Options are passed to the `init()` function as optional keyword arguments:

```python
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
    max_breadcrumbs=50,
    debug=True,

    # By default the SDK will try to use the SENTRY_RELEASE
    # environment variable, or infer a git commit
    # SHA as release, however you may want to set
    # something more human-readable.
    # release="myapp@1.0.0",
)
```
