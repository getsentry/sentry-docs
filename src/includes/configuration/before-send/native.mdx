```c
#include <sentry.h>

sentry_value_t strip_sensitive_data(sentry_value_t event, void *hint) {
  /* modify event here or return NULL to discard the event */
  return event;
}

int main(void) {
  sentry_options_t *options = sentry_options_new();
  sentry_options_set_before_send(options, strip_sensitive_data, NULL);
  sentry_init(options);

  /* ... */
}
```

The callback is executed in the same thread as the call to `sentry_capture_event`. Work performed by the function may thus block the executing thread. For this reason, consider avoiding heavy work in `before_send`.

<Alert level="warning" title="Not Supported in Crashpad on macOS">

The Crashpad backend on macOS doesn't currently support notifying the crashing process and thus can't correctly terminate sessions or call the registered `before_send` hook. It will also lose any events queued for sending at the time of the crash.

</Alert>
