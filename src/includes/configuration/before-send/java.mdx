A `BiFunction<SentryEvent, Object, SentryEvent>` can be used to mutate, discard (return null), or return a completely new event.

```java
import io.sentry.Sentry;

Sentry.init(
  options -> {
    options.setBeforeSend(
      (event, hint) -> {
        // Modify the event here:
        event.setServerName(null); // Don't send server names.
        return event;
      });
  });
```

When using the [Spring Boot integration](/platforms/java/guides/spring-boot/), `beforeSend`, it can be registered simply by creating a Spring `bean` implementing the `BeforeSendCallback`. See our documentation for [Advanced Usage](/platforms/java/guides/spring-boot/advanced-usage/#registering-custom-before-send-callback) of the Spring Boot integration for more details.
