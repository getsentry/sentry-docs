```ruby
Sentry.init do |config|
  filter = ActiveSupport::ParameterFilter.new(Rails.application.config.filter_parameters)
  config.before_send = lambda do |event, hint|
    # note1: if you have config.async configured, the event here will be a Hash instead of an Event object
    # note2: the code below is just an example, you should adjust the logic based on your needs
    event.request.data = filter.filter(event.request.data)
    event
  end
end
```
