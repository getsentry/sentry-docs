For instance, if any of the frames in the stack trace refer to a common external library, you could tell the system only to consider the top N frames:

```discover {tabTitle:Enhancement Rules}
# always only consider the top 1 frame for all native events
family:native max-frames=1

# if the bug is in proprietarymodule.so, only consider top 2 frames
family:native stack.package:**/proprietarymodule.so  max-frames=2

# these are functions we want to consider much more of the stack trace for
family:native stack.function:KnownBadFunction1  max-frames=5
family:native stack.function:KnownBadFunction2  max-frames=5
```
