The sentry-cocoa SDK always marks public frameworks such as  UIKitCore, CoreFoundation, GraphicsServices, and so forth as `not inApp`.
All private frameworks inside the application bundle are marked as `inApp`. For instance, the following marks frames from libdispatch
starting with `_dispatch_` as `inApp`.

```discover {tabTitle:Enhancement Rules}
stack.function:_dispatch_*  +app
```
