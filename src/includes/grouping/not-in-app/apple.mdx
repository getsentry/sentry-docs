You can also achieve the same result by marking other frames `not inApp`. The following sample marks functions from the classes `DataRequest` and `DownloadRequest` as `not inApp`.

```discover {tabTitle:Enhancement Rules}
stack.function:DataRequest*  -app
stack.function:DownloadRequest*  -app
```

#### 7.0.0 Preview
In the preview version 7.0.0, the sentry-cocoa SDK sets the `inApp` flag for frames originating from only the main executable by using the [CFBundleExecutable].
Public frameworks such as UIKitCore, CoreFoundation, GraphicsServices, and so forth, are always marked as `not inApp`. For private frameworks, such
as Sentry, dynamic and static frameworks differ. If you are not familiar with these terms, we recommend reading [Dynamic Library Programming Topics].

##### Dynamic Frameworks

If you use dynamic frameworks, such as, for example, Sentry, the SDK marks these as `not inApp`. In case you have a private framework that should be `inApp`,
you can use <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#in-app-include">inAppInclude</PlatformLink> or <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#in-app-exclude">inAppExclude</PlatformLink> of the SentryOptions.

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"

    // The SDK marks all frameworks starting with MyBusinessLogic as inApp
    options.add(inAppInclude: "MyBusinessLogic")

    // The SDK marks all frameworks starting with MyFramework as not inApp
    options.add(inAppExclude: "MyFramework")
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";

    // The SDK marks all frameworks starting with MyBusinessLogic as inApp
    [options addInAppInclude:@"MyBusinessLogic"];

    // The SDK marks all framework starting with MyFramework as not inApp
    [options addInAppExclude:@"MyFramework"];
}];
```

##### Static Frameworks

When using static frameworks, the frameworks end up in the main executable. Therefore, the SDK currently can't detect if a frame of the main executable
originates from your application or a private framework and marks all of them as `inApp`. To improve your experience, use the above explained stack trace rules to tell Sentry which should be marked as `not inApp`.
