You can also achieve the same result by marking other frames "not in-app." However, if that's the case, you should ensure that first all frames are set to "in-app" to override the defaults:

```discover {tabTitle:Enhancement Rules}
app:no                   +app
stack.function:std::*    -app
stack.function:boost::*  -app
```
<Note>

You need to force all frames to be in-app first because there might already have been some defaults set by the client SDK or earlier processing.
