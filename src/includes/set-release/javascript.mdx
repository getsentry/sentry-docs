```javascript
Sentry.init({
  release: "my-project-name@2.3.12",
});
```

A common way to do this with JavaScript in a Node/npm environment would be to use the [`process.env.npm_package_version`](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts#packagejson-vars) like so:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  release: "my-project-name@" + process.env.npm_package_version,
});
```
