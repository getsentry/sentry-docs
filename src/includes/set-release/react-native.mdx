You will also need to pass a distribution to `dist` for events to be attributed correctly to a release. Usually this value is the build number, for example `52`. This value needs to be unique to only each release.

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  release: "my-project-name@2.3.12",
  dist: "52",
});
```

<Alert level="info" title="Source Maps">

When you set a custom `release` and `dist` in a React Native app, the automatic source maps upload script will no longer work because it does not detect custom values. You will need to [manually upload source maps](/platforms/react-native/sourcemaps).
