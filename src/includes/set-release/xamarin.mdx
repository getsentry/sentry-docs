```csharp {tabTitle:C#}
using Sentry;

SentryXamarin.Init(o => o.Release = "my-project-name@2.3.12");
```

The SDK attempts to locate the release to add to events sent to Sentry.

<Note>

[Default values like 1.0 or 1.0.0.0 are ignored](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/blob/dbb5a3af054d0ca6f801de37fb7db3632ca2c65a/src/Sentry/Internal/ApplicationVersionLocator.cs#L14-L21).

</Note>

If that returns null, it'll look at the default `{PackageName}@{VersionString}` where the value varies according to the platform, for instance, on Android this value is going to be the join of the package in the manifest and android:versionName in the application,
for iOS, the release value is CFBundleIdentifier for PackageName and CFBundleShortVersionString for Version. Lastly, for UWP, the Name on the Identity node is PackageName while VersionString comes from Version on the Identity node.
