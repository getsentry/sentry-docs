```go
sentry.CaptureMessage("Something went wrong")
```

By default, Sentry's Go SDK uses an asynchronous transport. That means that calls to `CaptureException`, `CaptureEvent`, and `CaptureMessage` return without waiting for network operations. Instead, events are buffered and sent over the network in a background goroutine. Call `sentry.Flush` to wait for event delivery before the program terminates. You can change the default behavior by using a different transport, for example `HTTPSyncTransport`. More details in the [`Transports` section](/platforms/go/configuration/transports/).
