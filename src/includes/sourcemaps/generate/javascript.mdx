Most modern JavaScript transpilers support source maps. Below are instructions for some common tools.

<Note>

We recommend using Sentry's [Webpack plugin](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-webpack-plugin) to configure source maps and upload them automatically during the build.

</Note>

<Alert level="warning" title="source-map-support">

To rely on Sentry's source map resolution, your code cannot use the [source-map-support](https://www.npmjs.com/package/source-map-support) package. That package overwrites the captured stack trace in a way that prevents our processors from correctly parsing it.

</Alert>

## Webpack

Sentry provides a convenient [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) plugin that [configures source maps and automatically uploads them to Sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-webpack-plugin).

To use the plugin, you first need to install it:

```shell {tabTitle:npm}
npm install --save-dev @sentry/webpack-plugin
```

```shell {tabTitle:yarn}
yarn add --dev @sentry/webpack-plugin
```

Then, to configure it:

```javascript {filename:webpack.config.js}
const SentryWebpackPlugin = require("@sentry/webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  // other webpack configuration
  devtool: 'source-map',
  plugins: [
    new SentryWebpackPlugin({
      // sentry-cli configuration - can also be done directly through sentry-cli
      // see https://docs.sentry.io/product/cli/configuration/ for details
      authToken: process.env.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN,
      org: "___ORG_SLUG___",
      project: "___PROJECT_SLUG___",
      release: process.env.SENTRY_RELEASE,

      // other SentryWebpackPlugin configuration
      include: ".",
      ignore: ["node_modules", "webpack.config.js"],
    }),
  ],
};
```

Additionally, the Webpack plugin will automatically set `window.SENTRY_RELEASE`, so your `Sentry.init` call does not need to include a `release` value.

<PlatformSection supported={["javascript.vue"]}>

In Vue 2.x, you should use `vue.config.js` instead of `webpack.config.js`, and use `include: "./dist"` instead of `include: "."`

</PlatformSection>

<Note>

Set up the Webpack plugin as the last running plugin; otherwise, the source maps the plugin receives may not be the final ones.

</Note>

### Advanced Usage

If you prefer to upload source maps manually, configure Webpack to output source maps:

<PlatformContent includePath="configuration/sourcemaps/tools/webpack/advanced-usage" />

If you use [SourceMapDevToolPlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/source-map-dev-tool-plugin) for more fine-grained control of source map generation, turn off `noSources` so Sentry can display proper source code context in event stack traces.


## Rollup

You can configure [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) to generate source maps, which you can then [upload using `sentry-cli`](/product/cli/releases/#sentry-cli-sourcemaps):

```javascript {filename:rollup.config.js}
export default {
  entry: "./src/app.js",
  output: {
    file: "bundle.js",
    format: "cjs",
    sourceMap: true,
  },
};
```

## SystemJS

[SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/builder) can be configured to output source maps, which you can then [upload using `sentry-cli`](/product/cli/releases/#sentry-cli-sourcemaps):

```javascript
builder.bundle("src/app.js", "dist/app.min.js", {
  minify: true,
  sourceMaps: true,
  sourceMapContents: true,
});
```

<Note>

This example configuration will inline your original, un-transformed source code into the generated source map file. Sentry requires both source map(s) **and** your original source files to perform reverse transformations. If you choose NOT to inline your source files, you must make those source files available to Sentry _in addition_ to your source maps (see below).

</Note>

## TypeScript

The [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) compiler can output source maps, which you can then [upload using `sentry-cli`](/product/cli/releases/#sentry-cli-sourcemaps). 

Configure the `sourceRoot` property as `/` to strip the build path prefix from generated source code references. This allows Sentry to match source files relative to your source root folder:

```javascript {filename:tsconfig.json}
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "sourceMap": true,
    "inlineSources": true,
    "sourceRoot": "/"
  }
}
```

## UglifyJS

<Note>

We strongly encourage you to use a higher-level bundler (or transpiler), as UglifyJS configuration can get quite complicated, and it is difficult to achieve the desired results.

</Note>

[UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS) can be configured to output source maps, which you can then [upload using `sentry-cli`](/product/cli/releases/#sentry-cli-sourcemaps):

```bash
uglifyjs app.js \
  -o app.min.js.map \
  --source-map url=app.min.js.map,includeSources
```
