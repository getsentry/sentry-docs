Most modern JavaScript transpilers support source maps. Below are instructions for some common tools.

### Webpack

Webpack is a powerful build tool that resolves, bundles, and compresses your JavaScript modules. It also supports various _loaders_ to transpile higher-level languages, reference stylesheets, or include static assets.

Sentry provides a convenient [Webpack plugin](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-webpack-plugin) that configures source maps and uploads them to Sentry during the build. This process is the recommended one for uploading sources to Sentry:

<PlatformSection notSupported={["javascript.nextjs"]}>

```shell {tabTitle:npm}
npm install --save-dev @sentry/webpack-plugin
```

```shell {tabTitle:yarn}
yarn add --dev @sentry/webpack-plugin
```

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["javascript.nextjs"]}>
<Note>

If you’ve installed the Next.js SDK, you don’t have to install the plugin.

</Note>
</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection notSupported={["javascript.nextjs"]}>

You may configure [sentry-cli](/product/cli/configuration/) through it's documented mechanisms, or instead simply bind required parameters when initializing the plugin:

```javascript {filename:webpack.config.js}
const SentryWebpackPlugin = require("@sentry/webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  // other configuration
  configureWebpack: {
    plugins: [
      new SentryWebpackPlugin({
        // sentry-cli configuration
        authToken: process.env.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN,
        org: "___ORG_SLUG___",
        project: "___PROJECT_SLUG___",

        // webpack specific configuration
        include: "./dist",
        ignore: ["node_modules", "webpack.config.js"],
      }),
    ],
  },
};
```

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["javascript.nextjs"]}>

You may configure [sentry-cli](/product/cli/configuration/) through its documented mechanisms, or [extend the default usage of webpack](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/manual-setup/) of Next.js.

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["javascript.vue"]}>

In Vue 2.x, you should use `vue.config.js` instead of `webpack.config.js`, and use `include: "./dist"` instead of `include: "."`

</PlatformSection>

<Note>

Set up the `SentryWebpackPlugin` as the last running plugin, otherwise, the resulting source maps the plugin receives may not be the final one.

</Note>

#### Advanced Usage

If you prefer to upload source maps manually, configure Webpack to output source maps:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  output: {
    path: path.join(__dirname, "dist"),
    filename: "[name].js",
    sourceMapFilename: "[name].js.map",
  },
  // other configuration
};
```

If you use [SourceMapDevToolPlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/source-map-dev-tool-plugin) for more fine-grained control of source map generation, turn off `noSources` so Sentry can display proper source code context in event stack traces.

Additionally, the Webpack plugin will automatically set `window.SENTRY_RELEASE`, so your `Sentry.init` call will not need to be updated.

### Rollup

### SystemJS


SystemJS is the default module loader for Angular 2 projects. The [SystemJS build tool](https://github.com/systemjs/builder) can be used to bundle, transpile, and minify source code for use in production environments, and can be configured to output source maps.

```javascript
builder.bundle("src/app.js", "dist/app.min.js", {
  minify: true,
  sourceMaps: true,
  sourceMapContents: true,
});
```

<Note>

The example configuration above will inline your original, un-transformed source code into the generated source map file. Sentry requires both source map(s) **and** your original source files to perform reverse transformations. If you choose NOT to inline your source files, you must make those source files available to Sentry in _addition_ to your source maps (see below).

</Note>

</PlatformSection>

### TypeScript

The TypeScript compiler can output source maps. Configure the `sourceRoot` property to `/` to strip the build path prefix from generated source code references. This allows Sentry to match source files relative to your source root folder:

```javascript {filename:tsconfig.json}
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "sourceMap": true,
    "inlineSources": true,
    "sourceRoot": "/"
  }
}
```
<PlatformSection notSupported={["javascript.nextjs"]}>

### UglifyJS

UglifyJS is a popular tool for minifying your source code for production. It can dramatically reduce the size of your files by eliminating whitespace, rewriting variable names, removing dead code branches, and more.

<Note>

We strongly encourage you to use a higher level bundler (or transpiler) as UglifyJS configuration can get quite complicated to achieve the desired results.

</Note>

If you are using UglifyJS to minify your source code, the following command will additionally generate a source map that maps the minified code back to the original source:

```bash
uglifyjs app.js \
  -o app.min.js.map \
  --source-map url=app.min.js.map,includeSources
```
