For Sentry to understand how to resolve errors sources, we need to modify the data we send. Thankfully, we have an integration called `RewriteFrames` which can be used to do just that.

```javascript
import { RewriteFrames } from "@sentry/integrations";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [new RewriteFrames()],
});
```

There’s one critical thing to note here. This config assumes, that you’ll bundle your application into a single file, which will be served and then uploaded to Sentry from the root of the project's directory.

If you're not doing this, e.g. you're using TypeScript and upload all your compiled files separately to the server, then this may take a little more effort. Please refer to [TypeScript usage docs](/platforms/node/typescript/) to see a more complex and detailed example.
