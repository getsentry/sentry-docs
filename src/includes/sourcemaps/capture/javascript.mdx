Most modern JavaScript transpilers support source maps. Below you'll find our recommended instructions, though we also provide instructions for various [common tools](tools/).

<PlatformSection notSupported={["javascript.angular", "javascript.nextjs"]}>

We recommend using [Sentry's Webpack plugin](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-webpack-plugin) to configure source maps and upload them automatically during the build:

```shell {tabTitle:npm}
npm install --save-dev @sentry/webpack-plugin
```

```shell {tabTitle:yarn}
yarn add --dev @sentry/webpack-plugin
```

Next you need to generate an access token for our API. Within your organization's settings, navigate to Developer Settings, [create a new internal integration](/product/integrations/integration-platform/#internal-integrations), and provide a name appropriate to your organization. **Important:** Select **Releases -> Admin** for Permissions.

<Note>

The Releases -> Admin permission is also known as 'project:releases' in other API documentation.

</Note>

You may configure [sentry-cli](/product/cli/configuration/) through its documented mechanisms, or instead simply bind required parameters when initializing the plugin:

<PlatformSection notSupported={["javascript.gatsby"]}>

```javascript {filename:webpack.config.js}
const SentryWebpackPlugin = require("@sentry/webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  // other configuration
  configureWebpack: {
    plugins: [
      new SentryWebpackPlugin({
        // sentry-cli configuration
        authToken: process.env.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN,
        org: "___ORG_SLUG___",
        project: "___PROJECT_SLUG___",
        release: process.env.SENTRY_RELEASE,

        // webpack specific configuration
        include: ".",
        ignore: ["node_modules", "webpack.config.js"],
      }),
    ],
  },
};
```

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["javascript.gatsby"]}>

```javascript {filename:webpack.config.js}
const SentryWebpackPlugin = require("@sentry/webpack-plugin");

exports.onCreateWebpackConfig = ({ stage, actions }) => {
  if (stage === "build-javascript") {
    actions.setWebpackConfig({
      plugins: [
        new SentryWebpackPlugin({
          // sentry-cli configuration
          authToken: process.env.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN,
          org: "___ORG_SLUG___",
          project: "___PROJECT_SLUG___",

          // webpack specific configuration
          include: "./public",
          release: process.env.SENTRY_RELEASE,
        }),
      ],
    });
  }
};
```

You can change `SENTRY_RELEASE` directly to an [appropriate env variable](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/master/packages/gatsby/gatsby-node.js) based on the environment on which you are going to deploy your application.

<PlatformSection supported={["javascript.vue"]}>

In Vue 2.x, you should use `vue.config.js` instead of `webpack.config.js`, and use `include: "./dist"` instead of `include: "."`

</PlatformSection>

Note: The release value provided during source maps upload must match the value in the `Sentry.init` call.

Additional information can be found in our [Webpack documentation](tools/webpack/).

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["javascript.angular"]}>

SystemJS is the default module loader for Angular projects. The [SystemJS build tool](https://github.com/systemjs/builder) can be used to bundle, transpile, and minify source code for use in production environments, and can be configured to output source maps.

```javascript
builder.bundle("src/app.js", "dist/app.min.js", {
  minify: true,
  sourceMaps: true,
  sourceMapContents: true,
});
```

Additional information can be found in our [SystemJS documentation](tools/systemjs/).

From here, you can [upload your source maps](uploading/) to Sentry.

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["javascript.nextjs"]}>

You need to generate an access token for our API. Within your organization's settings, navigate to Developer Settings, [create a new internal integration](/product/integrations/integration-platform/#internal-integrations), and provide a name appropriate to your organization. **Important:** Select **Releases -> Admin** for Permissions.


<Note>

The Releases -> Admin permission is also known as 'project:releases' in other API documentation.

</Note>

You may configure [sentry-cli](/product/cli/configuration/) through its documented mechanisms, or follow the [recommended instructions for webpack](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/sourcemaps/tools/webpack/) for Next.js.
