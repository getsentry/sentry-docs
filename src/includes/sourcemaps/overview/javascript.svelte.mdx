Integrate your Svelte project's source maps with Sentry using these steps:

### 1: Generate Source Maps

The Svelte compiler and your bunlder (e.g. Vite) need to be configured to output source maps. Learn more about [how to generate source maps with Svelte](./generating/).

### 2: Provide Source Maps to Sentry

Source maps can be uploaded to Sentry by creating a release. Learn more about [how to upload source maps](./uploading/).

<Note>

By default, if Sentry can't find the uploaded files it needs, it will attempt to download them from the URLs in the stack trace. To disable this, turn off "Enable JavaScript source fetching" in either your organization's "Security & Privacy" settings or your project's general settings.
