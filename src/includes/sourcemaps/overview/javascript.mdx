In this section, you can find the recommended steps to integrate source maps of your project with Sentry.

### Step 1: Source Map Generation

Source maps can be generated by transpilers or bundlers you might be using in your project. You can find instructions to configure some common tools to output source maps that could be uploaded to Sentry [here](./generating/).

### Step 2: Uploading

If you use [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) in your project, the recommended way is to generate and upload your source maps via [`sentry-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-webpack-plugin). Alternatively, you can also use [`sentry-cli`](/product/cli/) to upload your source maps, generated by another tool.

Source maps can be either:

1.  [Uploaded directly to Sentry](./uploading) (**recommended**).
2.  [Served publicly over HTTP alongside your source files](./uploading/hosting-publicly/).

<Note>

Source maps should be **uploaded directly** to Sentry for Node.js projects.
