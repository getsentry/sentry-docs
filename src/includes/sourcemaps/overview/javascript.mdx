Integrate the source maps of your project with Sentry using these recommended steps:

### 1: Generate Source Maps

Source maps can be generated by transpilers or bundlers you might be using in your project. We provide instructions to configure common tools that [output source maps](./generating/).

### 2: Upload Source Maps

If you use [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) in your project, the recommended way is to generate and upload your source maps via [`sentry-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-webpack-plugin). Alternatively, you can also use [`sentry-cli`](/product/cli/) to upload your source maps, generated by another tool.

<PlatformSection notSupported={["node"]}>

Source maps can be either:

1.  [Uploaded directly to Sentry](./uploading): the **recommended** approach
2.  [Served publicly over HTTP alongside your source files](./uploading/hosting-publicly/)

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection notSupported={["javascript"]} supported={["node"]}>

<Note>

Source maps should be **uploaded directly** to Sentry for Node.js projects.

</Note>

Use either the Webpack plugin or Sentry CLI to then [upload your source maps](/platforms/node/sourcemaps/uploading/) to Sentry.
