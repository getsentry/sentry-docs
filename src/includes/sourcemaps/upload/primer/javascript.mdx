There are two recommended ways to provide your source maps to Sentry:

- Using the [Sentry Webpack plugin](./webpack/)
- Using [sentry-cli](./cli)

<Note>

Though we strongly recommend uploading source maps as part of your build process, you can also [serve them publicly alongside your source files](./hosting-publicly/).
