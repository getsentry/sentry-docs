We recommend uploading source maps as part of your build process, but you can also [serve them publicly alongside your source files](../hosting-publicly/).

<Note>

The recommended way to upload source maps is using [sentry-cli](/product/cli/). If you have used [_Sentry Wizard_](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-wizard) to set up your project, it has already created all necessary configuration to upload source maps. Otherwise, follow the [CLI configuration docs](/product/cli/configuration/) to set up your project.
