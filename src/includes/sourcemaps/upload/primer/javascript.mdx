We recommend uploading source maps as part of your build process, but you can also [serve them publicly alongside your source files](./hosting-publicly/).

<PlatformSection notSupported={["javascript"]} supported={["node"]}>

Source maps for Node.js projects should be **uploaded directly** to Sentry.

</PlatformSection>

<Note>

The recommended way to upload your source maps to Sentry is to use [`sentry-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-webpack-plugin). You can also use [`sentry-cli`](/product/cli/) if you don't use webpack in your project.
