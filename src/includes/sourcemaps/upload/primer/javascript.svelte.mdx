To upload your Svelte project's sourcemaps to Sentry, you currently have two options:

- Upload sourcemaps manually using [Sentry-CLI](./cli/). Take a look at this [bash script](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/tree/master/packages/svelte#sourcemaps-and-releases) as an example how to configure the CLI for a typical Svelte project.
