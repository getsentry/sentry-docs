On release, call `yarn sentry-upload-sourcemaps` to upload source maps and create a release. 

<Alert level="warning">
  
`sentry-upload-sourcemaps` requires either [`env` variables](https://docs.sentry.io/product/cli/configuration/#configuration-values) or a valid `.sentryclirc` file to pick up your project ID, organization ID and token. You can create `.sentryclirc` file with necessary configuration, as documented on this [page](https://docs.sentry.io/product/cli/configuration/).

</Alert>

To see more details on how to use the command, call `yarn sentry-upload-sourcemaps --help`.

For more advanced configuration, [directly use `sentry-cli` to upload source maps.](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cli).
