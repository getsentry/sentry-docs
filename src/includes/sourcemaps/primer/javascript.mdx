Sentry supports un-minifying JavaScript via source maps, which are JSON files that contain information on how to map your source code back to their original source. This lets you view source code context obtained from stack traces in their original untransformed form, which is particularly useful for debugging minified code (such as UglifyJS) or transpiled code from a higher-level language (such as TypeScript or ES6).

<Note>

Sentry will automatically fetch the source code and source maps by scraping the URLs within the stack trace. However, you may have legitimate reasons for [disabling the JavaScript source fetching in Sentry](https://blog.sentry.io/2018/07/17/source-code-fetching).

<Alert level="warning" title="source-map-support">

If you want to rely on Sentry's source map resolution, make sure that your code is not using the [source-map-support](https://www.npmjs.com/package/source-map-support) package, as it overwrites the captured stack trace in a way that makes it impossible for our processors to correctly parse it.
