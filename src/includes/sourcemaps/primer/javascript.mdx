Sentry supports un-minifying JavaScript via [Source Maps](https://blog.sentry.io/2015/10/29/debuggable-javascript-with-source-maps.html). This lets you view source code context obtained from stack traces in their original untransformed form, which is particularly useful for debugging minified code (e.g. UglifyJS), or transpiled code from a higher-level language (e.g. TypeScript, ES6).


<Note>

Sentry will automatically fetch the source code and source maps by scraping the URLs within the stack trace. However, you may have legitimate reasons for [disabling the JavaScript source fetching in Sentry](https://blog.sentry.io/2018/07/17/source-code-fetching).

</Note>

Source maps can be either:

1.  Uploaded directly to Sentry (**recommended**).
2.  Served publicly over HTTP alongside your source files.
