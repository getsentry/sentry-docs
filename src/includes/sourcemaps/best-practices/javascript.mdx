## Tool Selection

`sentry-webpack-plugin` is the recommended way to integrate your source maps into Sentry. You can use `sentry-cli` if you are not using webpack in your project.

## Configuration and Path Adjustments

The filenames/paths of your source maps should match with the reported names in stacktraces. You can use [options](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-webpack-plugin#options) to adjust the paths to your files. (Both `sentry-webpack-plugin` and `sentry-cli` have the same options.)

Here are details and examples for some options you might need to adjust your source maps.

### `include`

This option accepts one or more paths to scan recursively for sources. It will upload all `.map` files and match associated source code files.

Examples: 

- Including from where your transpiler/bundler outputs files.
  - `include: './app/.next'`
  - `include: './build'`

- Including from multiple folders.
  - `include: ['./src', './lib']`

- Recursively searching the whole project.
  - `include: '.'`

### `rewrite`

Enables rewriting of matching source maps so that indexed maps are flattened and missing sources are inlined if possible. Defaults to `true`. This option should be enabled for `stripPrefix` and `stripCommonPrefix` to work. 

### `urlPrefix`

This option adds a common prefix to beginning of all filenames. Defaults to `~/`. It can be used to adjust paths of your files in a sub folder.

### `stripPrefix`

Accepts an array of prefixes to be removed from uploaded filenames.

### `stripCommonPrefix`

You can refer to our working examples for commonly used setups [here](TODO).

<Note>

Depending on your setup, you might need different configurations for your source maps in `development` and `production` environments as the paths in stacktraces might be different.
