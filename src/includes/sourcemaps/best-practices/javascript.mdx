## A Simple Setup

In this simple project, the minified/transpiled files and their source maps reside in the same directory:

```{tabTitle: Project Structure}
├── build/
│   ├── worker.js
│   ├── worker.js.map
│   ├── app.js
│   ├── app.js.map
│   ├── index.html
├── package.json
├── public/
│   └── index.html
├── sentry.properties
├── src/
│   ├── app.js
│   └── worker.js
├── webpack.config.js
```

For this project, can use a simple Sentry configuration:

```javascript {tabTitle: webpack.config.js}
// ...
new SentryWebpackPlugin({
    // sentry-cli configuration
  authToken: process.env.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN,
  org: "___ORG_SLUG___",
  project: "___PROJECT_SLUG___",
  // webpack specific configuration
  include: "build",
  configFile: "sentry.properties",
  release: process.env.SENTRY_RELEASE,
}),
// ...
```

## Integration Tool

We recommend using the Webpack plugin to integrate your source maps into Sentry. You can use Sentry CLI if you are not using Webpack in your project.

## Consistent Release

For Sentry to associate error stack traces with your source maps, define the same release number, both in the Webpack plugin or Sentry CLI (whichever you use) **and** your `Sentry.init()` call. The easiest way to do that is to set the release number as an environment variable in your project:

```bash {tabTitle:.env}
# ...
SENTRY_RELEASE="1.2.3"
# ...
```

```javascript {tabTitle: webpack.config.js}
// ...
new SentryWebpackPlugin({
  // ... other options
  release: process.env.SENTRY_RELEASE,
});
// ...
```

```javascript {tabTitle: index.js}
// ...
Sentry.init({
  // ... other options
  release: process.env.SENTRY_RELEASE,
});
// ...
```

## Correct Source Paths

The filenames/paths of your source maps should match with the reported names in stack traces. You can use [options](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-webpack-plugin#options) to adjust the paths to your files. Both the Webpack plugin and Sentry CLI have the same options; those relevant to source maps are covered below. It's also possible to adjust the paths inside your stack traces using our [`RewriteFrames` integration](/configuration/integrations/plugin/#rewriteframes).

<Note>

Depending on your set up, you may need different configurations for your source maps in `development` and `production` environments as the paths in stack traces may differ.

### Options for Webpack and Sentry CLI

These options and examples will help integrate your source maps.

#### `include`

This option accepts one or more paths to scan recursively for sources and `*.map` files. For example:

1. Including from where your transpiler/bundler outputs files:

- `include: './app/.next'`
- `include: './build'`

2. Including from multiple folders:

- `include: ['./src', './lib']`

3. Recursively searching the entire project:

- `include: '.'`

#### `rewrite`

Enables rewriting of matching source maps so that indexed maps are flattened and missing sources are inlined if possible. Defaults to `true`.

This option should be enabled for `stripPrefix` and `stripCommonPrefix` to work.

#### `urlPrefix`

This option adds a common prefix to beginning of all filenames. Defaults to `~/`.

This option is useful when the entry point of the application (generally `index.html` for the browser side and `index.js` for Node), is one or more levels above the source/source map files, as in this example:

```{tabTitle: Target Folder Structure}
├── build/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── static/
│   │   ├── app.js
│   │   ├── app.js.map
```

In this case, configure as in this example:

```javascript {tabTitle: webpack.config.js}
// ...
new SentryWebpackPlugin({
  // ...
  include: "build/static/",
  urlPrefix: "~/static/"
  // ...
}),
// ...
```

#### `stripPrefix`

This option removes given prefixes from filenames. This is useful when you need to trim extra prefixes that your bundler/development server may add to your filenames such as `webpack://_N_E/`.

When you have the parent folders of your target files as unwanted prefixes, we recommend refining your `include` folders instead of using `stripPrefix`. For example, if your files are stored in `./build/static/js/` and you have `include: "build"` in your configuration, Sentry might fail to resolve your sources because of the extra prefix. If you update your configuration to `include: "build/static/js"`, you won't need to use `stripPrefix`.

### Adjusting Frames

Optionally, you can use Sentry's [`RewriteFrames`](/platforms/javascript/configuration/integrations/plugin/#rewriteframes) integration to fine-tune the paths inside your stack traces.

```javascript
import { RewriteFrames } from "@sentry/integrations";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    new RewriteFrames({
      // ... options
    }),
  ],
});
```
