## A Simple Setup

In this simple project, the minified/transpiled files and their source maps reside in the same directory:

```{tabTitle: Project Structure}
├── build/
│   ├── worker.js
│   ├── worker.js.map
│   ├── app.js
│   ├── app.js.map
│   ├── index.html
├── package.json
├── public/
│   └── index.html
├── sentry.properties
├── src/
│   ├── app.js
│   └── worker.js
├── webpack.config.js
```

For this project, we can use a simple Sentry configuration:

```javascript {tabTitle: webpack.config.js}
const SentryWebpackPlugin = require("@sentry/webpack-plugin");
// ...
plugins: [
  new SentryWebpackPlugin({
    authToken: process.env.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN,
    org: "___ORG_SLUG___",
    project: "___PROJECT_SLUG___",
      include: "build",
    configFile: "sentry.properties",
    release: process.env.SENTRY_RELEASE,
  }),
],
// ...
```

We recommend using the Webpack plugin to integrate your source maps into Sentry. You can use Sentry CLI if you are not using Webpack in your project.

## Consistent Release

For Sentry to associate error stack traces with your source maps, define your release number as a Webpack plugin option or a Sentry CLI argument (whichever you use). If you are using Sentry CLI, you should also define the same release number in your `Sentry.init()` call. The easiest way to assure consistency of the release number is to set it as an environment variable in your project:

```bash {tabTitle:.env}
# ...
SENTRY_RELEASE="1.2.3"
# ...
```

Then, if you are using `sentry-webpack-plugin`:

```javascript {tabTitle: webpack.config.js}
// ...
new SentryWebpackPlugin({
  // ... other options
  release: process.env.SENTRY_RELEASE,
});
// ...
```

Or, if you are using `Sentry CLI`:

```bash
sentry-cli releases new "$SENTRY_RELEASE"
sentry-cli releases files "$SENTRY_RELEASE" upload-sourcemaps /path/to/sourcemaps
```

```javascript {tabTitle: index.js}
// ...
Sentry.init({
  // ... other options
  release: process.env.SENTRY_RELEASE,
});
// ...
```

## Correct Source Paths

The filenames of your release artifacts (bundle files and source maps) should match with the reported paths in stack traces. You can use upload configuration to adjust the names of your files. Both the [Webpack plugin](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-webpack-plugin#options) and [Sentry CLI](/product/cli/releases/#sentry-cli-sourcemaps) have the same options; those relevant to source maps are covered below. It's also possible to adjust the paths inside your stack traces using our [`RewriteFrames` integration](/platforms/javascript/configuration/integrations/plugin/#rewriteframes).

<Note>

Depending on your set up, you may need different configurations for your source maps in `development` and `production` environments as the paths in stack traces may differ.

</Note>

### Options for Webpack and Sentry CLI

These options and examples will help integrate your source maps.

#### `include`

This option accepts one or more paths to scan recursively for sources and `*.map` files. For example:

1. Including from where your transpiler/bundler outputs files:

- `include: './app/.next'`
- `include: './build'`

2. Including from multiple folders:

- `include: ['./src', './lib']`

3. Recursively searching the entire project:

- `include: '.'`

#### `rewrite`

Enables rewriting of matching source maps so that indexed maps are flattened and missing sources are inlined if possible. Defaults to `true`.

This option should be enabled for `stripPrefix` and `stripCommonPrefix` to work.

#### `urlPrefix`

This option adds a common prefix to the beginning of all filenames. Defaults to `~/`, which is a wildcard that matches any scheme and hostname (the `http://my.web.site/` part of `http://my.web.site/path/to/script.js`).

This option is useful when the entry point of the application (generally `index.html` for the browser side and `index.js` for Node) is one or more levels above the source/source map files, as in this example:

```{tabTitle: Target Folder Structure}
├── build/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── static/
│   │   ├── app.js
│   │   ├── app.js.map
```

In this case, configure as in the following example:

```javascript {tabTitle: webpack.config.js}
// ...
new SentryWebpackPlugin({
  // ...
  include: "build/static/",
  urlPrefix: "~/static/"
  // ...
}),
// ...
```

#### `stripPrefix`

This option removes the given prefix from filenames _as referenced from within a sourcemap_ (in the `sources` entry, for instance). This is useful when you need to trim extra prefixes that your bundler/development server may add to your filenames, such as `webpack://_N_E/`.

Note that using the `stripPrefix` option will _not_ change the names of your uploaded files. When you have the parent folders of your target files as unwanted prefixes,  include the portion you want stripped in your `include` Webpack plugin option or in the `path/to/sourcemaps` passed to `sentry-cli`. For example, if your files are stored in `./build/static/js/` and you have `include: "build"` in your Webpack plugin configuration, your files will be uploaded with names like `~/static/js/bundle.js`. If you update your configuration to `include: "build/static/js"`, your files will upload as `~/bundle.js` (and so on) instead.

### Adjusting Frames

Optionally, you can use Sentry's [`RewriteFrames`](/platforms/javascript/configuration/integrations/plugin/#rewriteframes) integration to fine-tune the paths inside your stack traces.

```javascript
import { RewriteFrames } from "@sentry/integrations";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    new RewriteFrames({
      // ... options
    }),
  ],
});
```
