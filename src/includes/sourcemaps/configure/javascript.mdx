For Sentry to understand how to resolve an error's source, the data sent needs to be modified using the `RewriteFrames` integration. Note that configuring your SDK in this manner assumes you'll build your application into a single file, which will be served and uploaded to Sentry from the root of the project's directory.

If you're not doing this, for example, if you're using TypeScript and upload all your compiled files separately to the server, please refer to [our TypeScript usage docs](/platforms/node/typescript/).

```javascript
import { RewriteFrames } from "@sentry/integrations";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [new RewriteFrames()],
});
