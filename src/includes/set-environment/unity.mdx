```csharp
using Sentry;

// Add this to the SDK initialization callback
options.Environment = "production";
```

```fsharp
open Sentry

// Add this to the SDK initialization callback
options.Environment <- "production"
```

The SDK will set the environment by default depending on `Application.isEditor` to `editor` or `production` respectively.
