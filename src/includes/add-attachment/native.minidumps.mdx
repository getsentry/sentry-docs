To send attachments directly to Sentry, add more files to the multipart form
body. Note that the entire request must not exceed **20MB** in size, even with
compressed content encoding. Sentry will use the provided file names and mime
types and list those files in the _Event Attachments_ section at the bottom of
the _Issue Details_ page:

```bash
$ curl -X POST \
  '___MINIDUMP_URL___' \
  -F upload_file_minidump=@mini.dmp \
  -F some_file=@some_file.txt \
  -F db_log=@db.log
```
