You can either pass bytes or use a pathname to a file to create an attachment.

```java
import io.sentry.Sentry;
import io.sentry.Attachment;

Attachment bytesAttachment = new Attachment(bytes, "file.log");
Attachment fileAttachment = new Attachment("your/path/file.log");
```
```kotlin
import io.sentry.Sentry
import io.sentry.Attachment

val bytesAttachment = Attachment(bytes, "file.log")
val fileAttachment = Attachment("your/path/file.log")
```

The attachments live on the <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/scopes/">Scope</PlatformLink>. You can either add an attachment on the global scope to be sent with every event or add it on the <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/scopes/#local-scopes">local Scope</PlatformLink> to just send the attachment with one specific event.


```java
import io.sentry.Sentry;
import io.sentry.Attachment;

Attachment fileAttachment = new Attachment("your/path/file.log");

// Global Scope
Sentry.configureScope(
    scope -> {
      scope.addAttachment(fileAttachment);
    });

// Local Scope
Sentry.withScope(
      scope -> {
          scope.addAttachment(fileAttachment);

          Sentry.captureMessage("my message");
      });
```
```kotlin
import io.sentry.Sentry
import io.sentry.Attachment

val fileAttachment = Attachment("your/path/file.log")

// Global Scope
Sentry.configureScope { scope ->
    scope.addAttachment(fileAttachment)
}

// Local Scope
Sentry.withScope { scope ->
    scope.addAttachment(fileAttachment)
    Sentry.captureMessage("my message")
}
```
