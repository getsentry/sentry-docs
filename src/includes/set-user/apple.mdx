```swift
let user = User()
user.email = "john.doe@example.com"
SentrySDK.setUser(user)
```

```objc
SentryUser *user = [[SentryUser alloc] init];
user.email = @"john.doe@example.com";
[SentrySDK setUser:user];
```

Since 6.0.1: Sentry will by fallback to `installationId` if you do not provide a user identity.
