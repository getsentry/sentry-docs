In C# you can capture any exception object:

```csharp
using Sentry;

try
{
    AFunctionThatMightFail();
}
catch (Exception err)
{
    SentrySdk.CaptureException(err);
}
```

## Ignoring Errors

You can ignore exceptions by their type when initializing the SDK:

```csharp
// Add this to the SDK initialization callback
options.AddExceptionFilterForType<OperationCanceledException>();
```

This modifies the behavior of the [entire inheritance chain](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/inheritance#background-what-is-inheritance). As a result, the example code will also filter out `TaskCanceledException` since it derives from `OperationCanceledException`.
