## Tips for Catching Errors

- Use a `try/catch` block
- Use a `catchError` block for `Futures`
- The SDK already runs your init `callback` on an error handler, such as using `runZonedGuarded`, are captured automatically
- Flutter-specific errors, such as using `FlutterError.onError`, are captured automatically
- `Isolate` errors on the `current` Isolate which is the equivalent of a main/UI thread, such as using `Isolate.current.addErrorListener`, are captured automatically (only for non-Web Apps).
- For your own `Isolates`, add an `ErrorListener` and call `Sentry.captureException`
