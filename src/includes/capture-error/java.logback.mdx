With Logback you can log any exception object that you caught:

```java
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyClass.class);

try {
    throw new Exception("This is a test.");
} catch (Exception e) {
    logger.error("Error logs are turned into Sentry events", e);
}
```
