[Session Replay](/product/session-replay/) provides a video-like reproduction of user interactions on a site or web app. All user interactions, including page visits, mouse movements, clicks, and scrolls, are captured, helping developers connect the dots between a known issue and how a user experienced it in the UI.

You can search by session replay properties on the **Replay** page.
