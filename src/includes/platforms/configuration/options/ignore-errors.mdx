A list of strings or regex patterns that match error messages that shouldn't be sent to Sentry. Messages that match these strings or regular expressions will be filtered out before they're sent to Sentry. When using strings, partial matches will be filtered out, so if you need to filter by exact match, use regex patterns instead. By default, all errors are sent.
