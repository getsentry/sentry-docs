Add a custom integration to your JavaScript using the following format:

```javascript
// All integrations that come with an SDK can be found on Sentry.Integrations object
// Custom integration must conform to the Integration interface: https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/master/packages/types/src/integration.ts

Sentry.init({
  // ...
  integrations: [new MyAwesomeIntegration()],
});
```
