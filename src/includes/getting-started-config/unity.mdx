Currently, you can only configure Sentry using the Unity tools window.

The minimum required configuration, is to set your DSN in the window. The DSN is available in your Sentry project settings, or if you're logged in, you can copy from below:

```
___PUBLIC_DSN___
```

To configure it, open `Tools` -> `Sentry`.

And the Sentry configuration window will open:

After you close the window, all settings are saved into `Assets/Resources/Sentry/SentryOptions.json`. This file should be saved in your version control system.
