Currently, you can only configure Sentry using the Unity tools window.

Open `Tools` -> `Sentry`.

The first time you open the window, Unity Sentry SDK related files are created:

* `Assets/Resources/Sentry/SentryOptions.json` - Sentry settings
* `Assets/Resources/Sentry/link.xml` - [a special file](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ManagedCodeStripping.html) for [ILL2CPP](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/IL2CPP.html) builds

And the Sentry configuration window will open:

* Check `Enable` to enable Sentry event capturing
* `DSN` displays the Sentry DSN value

After you close the window, all settings are saved into `Assets/Resources/Sentry/SentryOptions.json`.
