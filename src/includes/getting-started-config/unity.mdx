The minimum configuration required is the [DSN](/product/sentry-basics/dsn-explainer/) to your project.

```
___PUBLIC_DSN___
```

<Note>

If you are logged in you can also select your project and copy its DSN directly from here.

</Note>

Sentry can be configured via the Sentry configuration window or [programatically](/platforms/unity/configuration/options/).
The window can be accessed by going to Unity's top menu: `Tools` > `Sentry`.

Sentry saves your configuration to `Assets/Resources/Sentry/SentryOptions.asset` and reads from there at runtime.
