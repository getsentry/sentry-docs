Initialize the Python SDK with the Django integration in your `settings.py` file. This snippet:
- Instruments your Django integration to [monitor the performance](/platforms/javascript/performance/) of your application.

To reduce the volume of performance data captured, or disable it entirely, change `traces_sample_rate` to a value between 0 and 1 in production.

```python {filename:settings.py}
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.django import DjangoIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    integrations=[DjangoIntegration()],
    traces_sample_rate=1.0, # We recommend adjusting this value in production

    # If you wish to associate users to errors (assuming you are using
    # django.contrib.auth) you may enable sending PII data.
    send_default_pii=True
)
```
