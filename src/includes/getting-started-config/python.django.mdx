Initialize the Python SDK with the Django integration in your `settings.py` file. Once this is done, the SDK captures all unhandled exceptions and transactions.

```python {filename:settings.py}
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.django import DjangoIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    integrations=[DjangoIntegration()],

    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for performance monitoring.
    # We recommend adjusting this value in production,
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,

    # If you wish to associate users to errors (assuming you are using
    # django.contrib.auth) you may enable sending PII data.
    send_default_pii=True,

    # By default the SDK will try to infer a git commit
    # SHA as release, however you may want to set
    # something more human-readable.
    # release="myapp@1.0.0",
)
```
