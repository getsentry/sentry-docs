```javascript
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";
import { Integrations } from "@sentry/tracing";
import App from "./App";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [new Integrations.BrowserTracing()],

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));

// Can also use with React Concurrent Mode
// ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(<App />);
```

Once this is done, all unhandled exceptions are automatically captured by Sentry.

If you're using React 16 or above, [Error Boundaries](components/errorboundary/) is an essential tool for defining your application's behavior in the face of errors.
