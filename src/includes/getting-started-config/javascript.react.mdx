You should initialize the Sentry React SDK as soon as possible during your application load up, before initializing React:

```JSX
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";
import { Integrations } from "@sentry/tracing";
import App from "./App";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___" ,
  integrations: [new Integrations.BrowserTracing()],

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));

// Can also use with React Concurrent Mode
// ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(<App />);
```

Once this is done, all unhandled exceptions are automatically captured by Sentry.

### Add React Error Boundary

If you're using React 16 or above, Error Boundaries are an essential tool for defining your application's behavior in the face of errors. The `@sentry/react` package exposes an error boundary component that automatically sends JavaScript errors from inside a React component tree to Sentry. You can use the error boundary just like a regular React component.

```JSX
import React from "react";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";

<Sentry.ErrorBoundary fallback={"An error has occurred"}>
  <Example />
</Sentry.ErrorBoundary>;
```

### Automatically Enrich Error Data

Events sent by the React SDK to Sentry are enriched with data that helps identify the source of the event. Much of this data is sent automatically - including the error context and environment - as well as the trail of events that led up to the event, which we call breadcrumbs. You don't need to configure these, though you may modify them.

Learn more about the data sent with events in [Enrich Event Data](enriching-events/context/).

### React Router

_(New in version 5.21.0)_

Sentry's performance instrumentation includes support for React Router 3, 4, and 5.

```JSX
import { Router } from 'react-router-dom';
import { createBrowserHistory } from 'history';

import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react';
import { Integrations } from '@sentry/tracing';

const history = createBrowserHistory();

Sentry.init({
  integrations: [
    new Integrations.BrowserTracing({
      // Can also use reactRouterV3Instrumentation or reactRouterV4Instrumentation
      routingInstrumentation: Sentry.reactRouterV5Instrumentation(history),
    });
  ],

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

// ...

// In your App render:
render() {
  return (
    // Use custom history with a Router component
    <Router history={history}>
      <Components />
    </Router>
  );
}
```

### Redux

_(New in version 5.20.0)_

Redux support is included in the `@sentry/react` package since version `5.20.0`. To apply Sentry to Redux, use `Sentry.createReduxEnhancer` at the same place that you initialize your Redux store.

```JSX
import { createStore, compose } from "redux";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";

// ...

const sentryReduxEnhancer = Sentry.createReduxEnhancer({
  // Optionally pass options
});

const store = createStore(rootReducer, sentryReduxEnhancer);

// ...
```

If you have other enhancers or middleware such as `thunk`:

```javascript
const store = createStore(
  rootReducer,
  compose(applyMiddleware(thunk), sentryReduxEnhancer)
);
```
