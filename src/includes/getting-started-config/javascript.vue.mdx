On its own, `@sentry/vue` will report any uncaught exceptions triggered by your application.

Additionally, the SDK will capture the name and props state of the active component where the error was thrown. This is reported via Vueâ€™s `config.errorHandler` hook.

To initialize Sentry in your Vue application, add this to your `app.js`:

```javascript
import Vue from "vue";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/vue";
import { Integrations } from "@sentry/tracing";

Sentry.init({
  Vue: Vue,
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [new Integrations.BrowserTracing()],

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

Sentry's Vue SDK accepts a few different configuration options that let you change its behavior:

- Passing in `Vue` is optional, if you do not pass it `window.Vue` must be present.
- Passing in `attachProps` is optional and is `true` if it is not provided. If you set it to `false`, Sentry will suppress sending all Vue components' props for logging.
- Passing in `logErrors` is optional and is `false` if it is not provided. If you set it to `true`, Sentry will call original Vue's `logError` function as well.

<Alert level="warning" title="Vue Error Handling">

Please note that if you enable the SDK, Vue will not call its `logError` internally. This means that errors occurring in the Vue renderer will not show up in the developer console.
If you want to preserve this functionality, make sure to pass the `logErrors: true` option.
