To initialize Sentry in your Vue application, add this to your `app.js`:

### Vue 2

```javascript
import Vue from "vue";
import Router from "vue-router";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/vue";
import { Integrations } from "@sentry/tracing";

Vue.use(Router);

const router = new Router({
  // ...
});

Sentry.init({
  Vue,
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    new Integrations.BrowserTracing({
      routingInstrumentation: Sentry.vueRouterInstrumentation(router),
      tracingOrigins: ["localhost", "my-site-url.com", /^\//],
    }),
  ],
  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for performance monitoring.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

// ...

new Vue({
  router,
  render: h => h(App),
}).$mount("#app");
```

### Vue 3

```javascript
import { createApp } from "vue";
import { createRouter } from "vue-router";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/vue";
import { Integrations } from "@sentry/tracing";

const app = createApp({
  // ...
});
const router = createRouter({
  // ...
});

Sentry.init({
  app,
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    new Integrations.BrowserTracing({
      routingInstrumentation: Sentry.vueRouterInstrumentation(router),
      tracingOrigins: ["localhost", "my-site-url.com", /^\//],
    }),
  ],
  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for performance monitoring.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

app.use(router);
app.mount("#app");
```

Additionally, Vue 3 allows you to use multiple apps with the same Sentry SDK instance, as well as add more apps dynamically after the SDK has been already initialized.

### Vue 3 - Multiple Apps

```javascript
const appOne = Vue.createApp(App);
const appTwo = Vue.createApp(App);
const appThree = Vue.createApp(App);

Sentry.init({
  app: [appOne, appTwo, appThree],
});
```

### Vue 3 - Manual Initialization

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/vue";

// ...
const app = createApp(App);

Sentry.init({
  app,
  // ...
});

const miscApp = createApp(MiscApp);
miscApp.mixin(Sentry.createTracingMixins({ trackComponents: true }));
Sentry.attachErrorHandler(miscApp, { logErrors: true });
```

The SDK accepts a few different configuration options that let you change its behavior:

- `attachProps` (defaults to `true`) - Includes all Vue components' props with the events.
- `logErrors` (defaults to `false`) - Decides whether SDK should call Vue's original `logError` function as well.
- `trackComponents` (defaults to `false`) - Decides whether to track components by hooking into its lifecycle methods. Can be set to either `boolean`, to enable/disable tracking for all of them, or to an array of specific component names (case-sensitive).
- `timeout` (defaults to `2000`) - Time in milliseconds dictating how long to wait until the tracked root activity is marked as finished and sent off to Sentry.
- `hooks` (defaults to `['activate', 'mount', 'update']`) - List of hooks to keep track of during component lifecycle `'activate' | 'create' | 'destroy' | 'mount' | 'unmount' | 'update'`.

<Note>

If you enable the SDK, Vue will not call its `logError` internally. As a result, errors occurring in the Vue renderer will not display in the developer console. To preserve this functionality, pass the `logErrors: true` option.
