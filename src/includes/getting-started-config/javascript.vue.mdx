To initialize Sentry in your Vue application, add this to your `app.js`:

```javascript
import Vue from "vue";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/vue";
import { Integrations } from "@sentry/tracing";

Sentry.init({
  Vue: Vue,
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [new Integrations.BrowserTracing()],

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

Sentry's Vue SDK accepts a few different configuration options that let you change its behavior:

- Passing in `Vue` is optional. If you do not pass it, `window.Vue` must be present.
- Passing in `attachProps` is optional and is `true` if it is not provided. If set to `false`, Sentry will suppress sending all Vue components' props for logging.
- Passing in `logErrors` is optional and is `false` if it is not provided. If set to `true`, Sentry will call original Vue's `logError` function as well.

<Note>

If you enable the SDK, Vue will not call its `logError` internally. As a result, errors occurring in the Vue renderer will not display in the developer console. To preserve this functionality, pass the `logErrors: true` option.
