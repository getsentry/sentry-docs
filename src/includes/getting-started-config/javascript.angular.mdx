This snippet includes automatic instrumentation to [monitor the performance](/platforms/javascript/performance/) of your application, which registers and configures the Tracing integration, including custom Angular routing instrumentation.

**Note:** To reduce the volume of performance data captured, or disable it entirely, change `tracesSampleRate` to a value between 0 and 1 in production.

```javascript
import { enableProdMode } from "@angular/core";
import { platformBrowserDynamic } from "@angular/platform-browser-dynamic";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/angular";
import { Integrations } from "@sentry/tracing";
import { AppModule } from "./app/app.module";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___" ,
  integrations: [
    new Integrations.BrowserTracing({
      tracingOrigins: ["localhost", "https://yourserver.io/api"],
      routingInstrumentation: Sentry.routingInstrumentation,
    }),
  ],
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0, // We recommend adjusting this in production
});


platformBrowserDynamic()
  .bootstrapModule(AppModule)
  .then(success => console.log(`Bootstrap success`))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```

You can also configure `@sentry/angular` to catch any Angular-specific exceptions reported through the [@angular/core/ErrorHandler](https://angular.io/api/core/ErrorHandler) provider.

`@sentry/angular` exports a Trace Service, Directive, and Decorators that leverages the `@sentry/tracing`, Sentry's Tracing integration, to add Angular-related spans to transactions. The service itself tracks route changes and durations, where directive and decorators are tracking component initializations.

### Automatically Send Errors with `ErrorHandler`

`@sentry/angular` exports a function to instantiate an `ErrorHandler` provider that will automatically send JavaScript errors captured by the Angular's error handler.

```javascript
import { NgModule, ErrorHandler } from "@angular/core";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/angular";

@NgModule({
  // ...
  providers: [
    {
      provide: ErrorHandler,
      useValue: Sentry.createErrorHandler({
        showDialog: true,
      }),
    },
  ],
  // ...
})
export class AppModule {}
```

You can configure the behavior of `createErrorHandler`. For more details see the `ErrorHandlerOptions` interface in [our repository](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/master/packages/angular/src/errorhandler.ts).

### Register `TraceService`

In Angular's DI system, register `TraceService` as a provider with a `Router` as its dependency:

```javascript
import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";
import { Router } from "@angular/router";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/angular";

@NgModule({
  // ...
  providers: [
    {
      provide: Sentry.TraceService,
      deps: [Router],
    },
  ],
  // ...
})
export class AppModule {}
```
Then, either require the `TraceService` from inside `AppModule` or use `APP_INITIALIZER` to force instantiate Tracing.
```javascript
@NgModule({
  // ...
})
export class AppModule {
  constructor(trace: Sentry.TraceService) {}
}
```

or

```javascript
import { APP_INITIALIZER } from "@angular/core";
@NgModule({
  // ...
  providers: [
    {
      provide: APP_INITIALIZER,
      useFactory: () => () => {},
      deps: [Sentry.TraceService],
      multi: true,
    },
  ],
  // ...
})
export class AppModule {}
```
