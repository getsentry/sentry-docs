You should initialize the SDK as early as possible, for an example, the start of OnCreate
on MainActivity for Android, and, the top of FinishedLaunching on AppDelegate for iOS).

```csharp
using Sentry;

SentryXamarin.Init(o =>
{
    o.AddXamarinFormsIntegration();
    // Tells which project in Sentry to send events to:
    o.Dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    // When configuring for the first time, to see what the SDK is doing:
    o.Debug = true;
    // Set TracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    // of transactions for performance monitoring.
    // We recommend adjusting this value in production
    o.TracesSampleRate = 1.0;
});
// App code

```
