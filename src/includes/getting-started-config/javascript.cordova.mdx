You should `init` the SDK in the `deviceReady` function, to make sure the native integrations runs. For more details about Cordova [click here](/platforms/javascript/cordova/)

```javascript
onDeviceReady: function() {
  var Sentry = cordova.require("sentry-cordova.Sentry");
  Sentry.init({ dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___' });
}
```

You will also need to allow Sentry's domain in your `config.xml` like:

```xml {filename:config.xml}
<access origin="sentry.io" />
```
