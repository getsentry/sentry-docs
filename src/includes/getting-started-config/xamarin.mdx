You should initialize the SDK as early as possible, for an example, the start of OnCreate
on MainActivity for Android, and, the top of FinishedLaunching on AppDelegate for iOS).


```csharp
SentryXamarin.Init(o =>
{
	o.AddXamarinFormsIntegration();
    o.Dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___";
});
// App code

```
