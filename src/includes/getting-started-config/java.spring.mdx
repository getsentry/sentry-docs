The `sentry-spring` library provides `@EnableSentry` annotation that registers all required Spring beans. `@EnableSentry` can be placed on any class annotated with [@Configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/Configuration.html) including the main entry class in Spring Boot applications annotated with [@SpringBootApplication](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/api/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/SpringBootApplication.html).

```java {tabTitle:Java}
import io.sentry.spring.EnableSentry;
// NOTE: Replace the test DSN below with YOUR OWN DSN to see the events from this app in your Sentry
// project/dashboard
@EnableSentry(dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___")
@Configuration
class SentryConfiguration {
}
```

```kotlin {tabTitle:Kotlin}
import io.sentry.spring.EnableSentry
// NOTE: Replace the test DSN below with YOUR OWN DSN to see the events from this app in your Sentry
// project/dashboard
@EnableSentry(dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___")
@Configuration
class SentryConfiguration
```

The DSN can be also provided through the system property `sentry.dsn`, environment variable `SENTRY_DSN` or the `dsn` property in `sentry.properties` file. [See the configuration page](/platforms/java/configuration/) for more details on external configuration.

Once this integration is configured you can _also_ use Sentryâ€™s static API, [as shown on the usage page](usage/), to record breadcrumbs, set the current user, or manually send events, for example.

By default, every unhandled exception is sent to Sentry, even those captured with `@ExceptionHandler` annotated methods. This behavior can be tuned through configuring `exceptionResolverOrder` property on `@EnableSentry` annotation. For example, setting it to `Ordered.LOWEST_PRECEDENCE` makes sure only exceptions that have not been handled by exception resolvers with higher order are sent to Sentry.

```java {tabTitle:Java}
import io.sentry.spring.EnableSentry;
import org.springframework.core.Ordered;
// NOTE: Replace the test DSN below with YOUR OWN DSN to see the events from this app in your Sentry
// project/dashboard
@EnableSentry(
  dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  exceptionResolverOrder = Ordered.LOWEST_PRECEDENCE
)
```

```kotlin {tabTitle:Kotlin}
import io.sentry.spring.EnableSentry
import org.springframework.core.Ordered
// NOTE: Replace the test DSN below with YOUR OWN DSN to see the events from this app in your Sentry
// project/dashboard
@EnableSentry(
  dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  exceptionResolverOrder = Ordered.LOWEST_PRECEDENCE
)
```
