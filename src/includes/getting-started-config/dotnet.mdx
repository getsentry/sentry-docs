For example, initialize in the `Main` method in `Program.cs`:

```csharp {filename:Program.cs}
using (SentrySdk.Init(o => {
    // Tells which project in Sentry to send events to:
    o => o.Dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    // Set TracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    // of transactions for performance monitoring.
    // We recommend adjusting this value in production
    options.TracesSampleRate = 1.0; }))
{
    // App code goes here - Disposing will flush events out
}
```

```fsharp {filename:Program.fs}
use __ = SentrySdk.Init ("___PUBLIC_DSN___")
```
