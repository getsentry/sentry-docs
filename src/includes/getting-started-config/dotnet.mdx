For example, initialize in the `Main` method in `Program.cs`:

```csharp {filename:Program.cs}
using (SentrySdk.Init(o => 
{
    // Tells which project in Sentry to send events to:
    o.Dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    // When configuring for the first time, to see what the SDK is doing:
    o.Debug = true;
    // Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100% of transactions for performance monitoring.
    // We recommend adjusting this value in production.
    o.TracesSampleRate = 1.0; 
}))
{
    // App code goes here - Disposing will flush events out
}
```

```fsharp {filename:Program.fs}
use __ = SentrySdk.Init (fun o ->
    o.Dsn <- "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    // When configuring for the first time, to see what the SDK is doing:
    o.Debug <- true
    // Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100% of transactions for performance monitoring.
    // We recommend adjusting this value in production.
    o.TracesSampleRate <- 1.0
    )

// App code goes here - Disposing will flush events out
```
