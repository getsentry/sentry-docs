This snippet includes automatic instrumentation to [monitor the performance](/./advanced-configuration/) of your application, which registers and configures the Tracing integration, including custom Ember instrumentation.

```javascript
import Application from '@ember/application';
import Resolver from 'ember-resolver';
import loadInitializers from 'ember-load-initializers';
import config from './config/environment';

import { InitSentryForEmber } from '@sentry/ember';

InitSentryForEmber();

export default class App extends Application {
  modulePrefix = config.modulePrefix;
  podModulePrefix = config.podModulePrefix;
  Resolver = Resolver;
}
```

Then add the following config to your `config/environment.js`:

To reduce the volume of performance data captured, or disable it entirely, change `tracesSampleRate` to a value between 0 and 1 in production.

```javascript
ENV['@sentry/ember'] = {
  sentry: {
    dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
    tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
    // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    // of transactions for performance monitoring.
    // We recommend adjusting this value in production,
  }
};
```

This SDK uses Ember configuration conventions to manage its automatic instrumentation and other Sentry options, to learn more [see the advanced configuration page](./advanced-configuration/)
