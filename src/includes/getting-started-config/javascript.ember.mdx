This snippet includes automatic instrumentation to monitor the performance of your application, which registers and configures the Tracing integration, including custom [Ember instrumentation](./configuration/ember-options/).

```javascript
import Application from "@ember/application";
import Resolver from "ember-resolver";
import loadInitializers from "ember-load-initializers";
import config from "./config/environment";

import { InitSentryForEmber } from "@sentry/ember";

InitSentryForEmber();

export default class App extends Application {
  modulePrefix = config.modulePrefix;
  podModulePrefix = config.podModulePrefix;
  Resolver = Resolver;
}
```

Then add the following config to your `config/environment.js`:

```javascript
ENV["@sentry/ember"] = {
  sentry: {
    dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

    // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    // of transactions for performance monitoring.
    // We recommend adjusting this value in production,
    tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  },
};
```

<Note>

This SDK uses Ember configuration conventions to manage its automatic instrumentation and other Sentry options, this additional configuration can be found under <PlatformLink to="/configuration/ember-options/">Ember options</PlatformLink>.
