To use this SDK, initialize Sentry in your Remix entry points for both the client and server.

```typescript {filename: entry.client.tsx}
import { useLocation, useMatches } from "@remix-run/react";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/remix";
import { useEffect } from "react";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "__DSN__",
  tracesSampleRate: 1,
  integrations: [
    new Sentry.BrowserTracing({
        routingInstrumentation: Sentry.remixRouterInstrumentation(
            useEffect,
            useLocation,
            useMatches,
        ),
    }),
  ],
  // ...
});
```

Initialize Sentry in your entry point for the server to capture exceptions and get performance metrics for your [`action`](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/api/conventions#action) and [`loader`](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/api/conventions#loader) functions. You can also initialize Sentry's database integrations, such as Prisma, to get spans for your database calls.

```typescript {filename: entry.server.tsx}
import { prisma } from "~/db.server";

import * as Sentry from "@sentry/remix";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "__DSN__",
  tracesSampleRate: 1,
  integrations: [new Sentry.Integrations.Prisma({ client: prisma })],
  // ...
});
```

Also, wrap your Remix root with Sentry's `ErrorBoundary` component to catch React component errors, and `withSentryRouteTracing` to get parameterized router transactions.

```typescript {filename: root.tsx}
import {
  Links,
  LiveReload,
  Meta,
  Outlet,
  Scripts,
  ScrollRestoration,
} from "@remix-run/react";

import { ErrorBoundary, withSentryRouteTracing } from "@sentry/remix";

function App() {
  return (
    <ErrorBoundary>
      <html>
        <head>
          <Meta />
          <Links />
        </head>
        <body>
          <Outlet />
          <ScrollRestoration />
          <Scripts />
          <LiveReload />
        </body>
      </html>
    </ErrorBoundary>
  );
}

export default withSentryRouteTracing(App);
```

Once you've done this set up, the SDK will automatically capture unhandled errors and promise rejections, and monitor performance in the client. You can also [manually capture errors](/platforms/javascript/guides/remix/usage).
