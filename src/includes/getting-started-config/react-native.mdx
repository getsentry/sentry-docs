### Initialize

To initialize the SDK, you need to call:

```javascript {filename:App.js}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react-native";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
});
```

Once this is done, all unhandled exceptions will be automatically captured by Sentry. You can also perform the following optional steps:

### Wrap your app

You should wrap your app with Sentry to automatically instrument your app with [touch event tracking](/platforms/react-native/touchevents/) and [automatic performance monitoring](/platforms/react-native/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/):

```javascript {filename:App.js}
export default Sentry.wrap(App);
```

### Enable Performance Monitoring

You should also enable [performance monitoring](/platforms/react-native/performance/) so Sentry can monitor your app's performance.
