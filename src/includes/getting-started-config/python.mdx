Once this is done, Sentry's Python SDK captures all unhandled exceptions and transactions.

```python
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for performance monitoring.
    # We recommend adjusting this value in production.
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
)
```
