To use the SDK, initialize it in your Svelte entry point before bootstrapping your app. In a typical Svelte project, that is your `main.js` or `main.ts` file.

```typescript {filename: main.ts}
import "./app.css";
import App from "./App.svelte";

import * as Sentry from "@sentry/svelte";
import { BrowserTracing } from "@sentry/tracing";

// Initialize the Sentry SDK here
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  release: "my-project-name@2.3.12",
  integrations: [new BrowserTracing()],

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for performance monitoring.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

const app = new App({
  target: document.getElementById("app"),
});

export default app;
```

```javascript {filename: main.js}
import "./app.css";
import App from "./App.svelte";

import * as Sentry from "@sentry/svelte";
import { BrowserTracing } from "@sentry/tracing";

// Initialize the Sentry SDK here
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  release: "my-project-name@2.3.12",
  integrations: [new BrowserTracing()],

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for performance monitoring.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

const app = new App({
  target: document.getElementById("app"),
});

export default app;
```

Once you've done this set up, the SDK will automatically capture unhandled errors and promise rejections, and monitor performance in the client. You can also [manually capture errors](/platforms/javascript/guides/svelte/usage).
