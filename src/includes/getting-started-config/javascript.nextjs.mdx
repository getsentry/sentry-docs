```Npx
npx sentry-wizard -i nextjs
```

<Note>

The call to the [Sentry Wizard](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-wizard) will automatically patch your project accordingly, though you can [setup manually](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/manual-setup/) if you prefer.
It will perform the following changes:

- create `sentry.client.config.js` and `sentry.server.config.js` with the default `Sentry.init` (if they already exist, they will be `_sentry.client.config.js` and `_sentry.server.config.js` instead).
- create `next.config.js` with the default configuration (if it already exists it will be `_next.config.js` instead, which will need to be merged manually).
- create `sentry.properties` with Sentry’s project-specific data.

</Note>

<Note>

Next.js’ development mode doesn’t perform some checks as it does in production mode during the build process.
As a result, the SDK may not behave as expected by not catching some errors.
You can get rid of them by building your app.
