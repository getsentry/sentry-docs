Though it's possible to [configure everything manually](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/manual-setup/), we have a wizard that will automate the initial steps. To use the wizard, run the following command from the root level of your project:

```bash
npx @sentry/wizard -i nextjs
```

You'll be prompted to log in to Sentry. The wizard will then automatically add these configuration files to your project:

- create `sentry.client.config.js` and `sentry.server.config.js` with the default `Sentry.init`
- create `next.config.js` with the default configuration
- create `sentry.properties` with configuration for `sentry-cli` (which is used when automatically uploading source maps)

See [manual configuration](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/manual-setup/) for examples of the files created by the wizard. If any of these files already exists, it will be created with a leading underscore and you will need to merge it with the existing file manually.

To complete your configuration, add [options](/platforms/javascript/configuration/) to your two `Sentry.init()` calls (in `sentry.client.config.js` and `sentry.server.config.js`, respectively).
In those two files you can also set context data - data about the [user](/platforms/javascript/enriching-events/identify-user/), for example, or [tags](/platforms/javascript/enriching-events/tags/), or even [arbitrary data](/platforms/javascript/enriching-events/context/) - which will be added to every event sent to Sentry.
For example:

```javascript {filename:sentry.client.config.js}
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/nextjs';

Sentry.configureScope(scope => {
  scope.setUser({ id: '4711' });
  scope.setTag('user_mode', 'admin');
  scope.setExtra('battery', 0.7);
});
```

Once you're set up, the SDK will automatically capture unhandled errors and promise rejections. You can also [manually capture errors](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/usage).
