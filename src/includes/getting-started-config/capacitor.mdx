You should `init` the SDK as soon as possible during your app's creation stage.

```javascript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/capacitor';
import { Integrations } from '@sentry/tracing';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // To set your release version
  release: "my-project-name@" + process.env.npm_package_version,
  integrations: [new Integrations.BrowserTracing()],

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for performance monitoring.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```
