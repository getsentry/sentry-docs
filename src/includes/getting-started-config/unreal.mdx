```c
#include <sentry.h>

int main(void) {
  sentry_options_t *options = sentry_options_new();
  sentry_options_set_dsn(options, "___PUBLIC_DSN___");
  sentry_options_set_release(options, "my-project-name@2.3.12");
  sentry_init(options);

  /* ... */

  // make sure everything flushes
  sentry_close();
}
```

Alternatively, the DSN can be passed as `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable during runtime. This can be especially useful for server applications.

<Alert level="warning" title="Warning">

Calling `sentry_close()` before exiting the application is critical. It
ensures that events can be sent to Sentry before execution stops. Otherwise,
event data may be lost.
