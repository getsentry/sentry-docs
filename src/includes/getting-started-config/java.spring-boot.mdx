Sentry's Spring Boot integration auto-configures `sentry.in-app-packages` property with the package where `@SpringBootApplication` or `@SpringBootConfiguration` annotated class is located.

Provide a `sentry.dsn` property using either `application.properties` or `application.yml`:

```properties {filename:application.properties}
sentry.dsn=___PUBLIC_DSN___
```

```yaml {filename:application.yml}
sentry:
  dsn: ___PUBLIC_DSN___
```

By default, every unhandled exception is sent to Sentry, even those captured with `@ExceptionHandler` annotated methods. This behavior can be tuned through configuring `sentry.exception-resolver-order` property. For example, setting it to `2147483647` (the value of `org.springframework.core.Ordered#LOWEST_PRECEDENCE`) makes sure only exceptions that have not been handled by exception resolvers with higher order are sent to Sentry.

```properties {filename:application.properties}
sentry.exception-resolver-order=2147483647
```

```yaml {filename:application.yml}
sentry:
  exception-resolver-order: 2147483647
```

We recommend using Sentry's Spring Boot integration with one of the [logging framework integrations](logging-frameworks/) as they work together seamlessly. To use Sentry **without** Spring Boot, we recommend using the [Sentry Spring integration](/platforms/java/guides/spring/).

Once this integration is configured you can _also_ use Sentryâ€™s static API, [as shown on the usage page](usage/), to record breadcrumbs, set the current user, or manually send events, for example.
