Add `use Sentry::Rack::CaptureException` to your `config.ru` or other rackup file:

```ruby {filename:config.ru}
require 'sentry-ruby'

Sentry.init do |config|
  config.dsn = '___PUBLIC_DSN___'

  # if you want to activate performance monitoring, you also need to set one of these options:
  config.traces_sample_rate = 0.5
  # or
  config.traces_sampler = lambda do |context|
    true
  end
end

use Sentry::Rack::Tracing # if you want to have performance monitoring
use Sentry::Rack::CaptureException
```
