- Uses `process.env.npm_package_version` to configure the version of your application. Learn more about [releases](/product/releases/) and how they are used with [source maps](/platforms/javascript/sourcemaps/).

import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";
import { Integrations } from "@sentry/tracing";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  release: "my-project-name@" + process.env.npm_package_version, // To set your release version
  integrations: [new Integrations.BrowserTracing()],
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0, // We recommend adjusting this in production
});
