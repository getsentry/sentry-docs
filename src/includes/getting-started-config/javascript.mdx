This snippet:
- Uses `process.env.npm_package_version` to configure the version of your application. Learn more about [releases](/product/releases/) and how they are used with [source maps](/platforms/javascript/sourcemaps/).
- Instruments your SDK to [monitor the performance](/platforms/javascript/performance/) of browser applications.

To reduce the volume of performance data captured, or disable it entirely, change `tracesSampleRate` to a value between 0 and 1 in production.

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  release: "my-project-name@" + process.env.npm_package_version, // To set your release version
  integrations: [new Integrations.BrowserTracing()],
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0, // We recommend adjusting this in production
});
