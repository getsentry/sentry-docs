Once this is done, Sentry's JavaScript SDK captures all unhandled exceptions and transactions.

```javascript {tabTitle: ESM}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";
import { Integrations } from "@sentry/tracing";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // To set your release version
  release: "my-project-name@" + process.env.npm_package_version,
  integrations: [new Integrations.BrowserTracing()],

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for performance monitoring.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,

});
```
