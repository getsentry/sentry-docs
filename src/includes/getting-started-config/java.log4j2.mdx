The following example using the `log4j2.xml` format to configure a `ConsoleAppender` that logs to standard out at the `INFO` level, and a `SentryAppender` that logs to the Sentry server at the `ERROR` level.

<Note>

The `ConsoleAppender` is provided only as an example of a non-Sentry appender set to a different logging threshold, similar to what you may already have in your project.

</Note>

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Configuration status="warn" packages="org.apache.logging.log4j.core,io.sentry.log4j2">
    <Appenders>
        <Console name="Console" target="SYSTEM_OUT">
            <PatternLayout pattern="%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%t] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n"/>
        </Console>
        <Sentry name="Sentry"
                dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___" />
    </Appenders>
    <Loggers>
        <Root level="info">
            <AppenderRef ref="Sentry"/>
            <AppenderRef ref="Console"/>
        </Root>
    </Loggers>
</Configuration>
```

### DSN Configuration

Note that **you need to configure your DSN** (client key) only if you wish to initialize the SDK through the log4j2 integration. If you're planning to use `Sentry.init` to provide configuration, such as by using the `beforeSend` callback, you **should not** provide the DSN in both `Sentry.init` and the appender configuration; just leave it out of the appender configuration in this case.

```xml
<Sentry name="Sentry"
        dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___" />
```

If the DSN is not present in the `log4j2.xml` configuration, Sentry will attempt to read it from the system property `sentry.dsn`, environment variable `SENTRY_DSN` or the `dsn` property in `sentry.properties` file. [See the configuration page](/platforms/java/configuration/) for more details on external configuration.

### Minimum Log Level

Two log levels are used to configure this integration, as illustrated below in the provided code samples:

1. Configure the lowest level required for a log message to become an event (`minimumEventLevel`) sent to Sentry.
2. Configure the lowest level a message has to be to become a breadcrumb (`minimumBreadcrumbLevel`)

Breadcrumbs are kept in memory (by default the last 100 records) and are sent with events. For example, by default, if you log 100 entries with `logger.info` or `logger.warn`, no event is sent to Sentry. If you then log with `logger.error`, an event is sent to Sentry that includes those 100 `info` or `warn` messages. For this to work, `SentryAppender` needs to receive **all** log entries to decide what to keep as breadcrumb or send as event. Set the `SentryAppender` log level configuration to a value lower than what is set for the `minimumBreadcrumbLevel` and `minimumEventLevel` so that `SentryAppender` receives these log messages.

```xml
<!-- Setting minimumBreadcrumbLevel modifies the default minimum level to add breadcrumbs from INFO to DEBUG  -->
<!-- Setting minimumEventLevel the default minimum level to capture an event from ERROR to WARN  -->
<Sentry name="Sentry"
        dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___"
        minimumBreadcrumbLevel="DEBUG"
        minimumEventLevel="WARN"
/>
```
