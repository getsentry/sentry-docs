Once this is done, Sentry's Node SDK captures all transactions and unhandled exceptions.

```javascript {tabTitle:ESM}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/node";
import * as Tracing from "@sentry/tracing";

Sentry.init({
    dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___" });

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

```javascript {tabTitle:CommonJS}
const Sentry = require("@sentry/node");
const Tracing = require("@sentry/tracing");

Sentry.init({
    dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___" });

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```
