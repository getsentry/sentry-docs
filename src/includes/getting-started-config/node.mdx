Once this is done, Sentry's Node SDK captures all transactions and unhandled exceptions.

```javascript {tabTitle:ESM}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/node";

// Importing @sentry/tracing patches the global hub for tracing to work.
import "@sentry/tracing";

// If you want to use `@sentry/tracing` in your project directly, use a named import instead:
// import * as SentryTracing from "@sentry/tracing"
// Unused named imports are not guaranteed to patch the global hub.

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

```javascript {tabTitle:CommonJS}
const Sentry = require("@sentry/node");

// Importing @sentry/tracing patches the global hub for tracing to work.
const SentryTracing = require("@sentry/tracing");

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```
