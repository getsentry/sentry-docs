<Note>

Session Replay is currently in beta. Beta features are still in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony. If you have any questions, feedback or would like to report a bug, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/new/choose) with a link to a relevant replay or, if possible, a publicly accessible URL to the page you're attempting to record a replay of. 

Session Replay supports all browser JavaScript applications. It is built to work with @sentry/browser, and our browser framework SDKs.
