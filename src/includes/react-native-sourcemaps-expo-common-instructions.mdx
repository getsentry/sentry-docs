## Common Setup

To upload source maps, the Sentry Expo Plugin and the Sentry Metro Plugin need to be added to the Expo application.

### Add the Sentry Expo Plugin

To ensure bundles and source maps are automatically uploaded during the local and EAS native applications builds, add the `@sentry/react-native/expo` config plugin to the Expo application configuration:

<Include name="react-native-expo-plugin-code-snippet.mdx" />

### Add the Sentry Metro Plugin

To ensure unique Debug IDs are assigned to the generated bundles and source maps, add the Sentry Metro Plugin to the configuration:

<Include name="react-native-expo-metro-plugin-code-snippet.mdx" />
