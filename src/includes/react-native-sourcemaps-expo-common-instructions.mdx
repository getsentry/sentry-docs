## Common Setup

To upload source maps to Sentry Sentry Expo Plugin and Sentry Metro Plugin needs to be add to the Expo application.

### Add the Sentry Expo Plugin

To ensure the bundles and source maps are automatically uploaded during the local and EAS native applications builds, add `@sentry/react-native/expo` to the Expo application configuration:

<Include name="react-native-expo-plugin-code-snippet.mdx" />

### Add Sentry Metro Plugin

To ensure unique Debug IDs get assigned to the generated bundles and source maps, add Sentry Serializer to the Metro configuration:

<Include name="react-native-expo-metro-plugin-code-snippet.mdx" />
