The Unreal Engine (UE) SDK is currently compatible with **UE 4.26 or later** and supports **Windows**, **macOS**, **iOS**, and **Android**.

To build the SDK, download the latest sources from the [Releases page](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-unreal/releases) and place it in the project's `Plugins` directory. On the next project launch, UE will prompt to build SentrySDK module.

<Note>

Currently, this method is available only for C++ UE projects. Blueprint projects can be converted to a C++ one by adding an empty class using the editor.

</Note>

After the successful build, in the editor navigate to the **Settings > Plugins > Code Plugins** menu and check whether the Sentry SDK plugin is enabled:

To access the plugin API from within C++,
add `SentrySDK` support to the build script (`MyProject.build.cs`):

```csharp
PublicDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] { ..., "SentrySDK" });
```
