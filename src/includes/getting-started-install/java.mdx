To install the Android SDK, add it your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy {filename:build.gradle}
// Make sure jcenter is there.
repositories {
    jcenter()
}

// Add Sentry's SDK as a dependency.
dependencies {
    // https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/releases
    implementation 'io.sentry:sentry:{version}'
}
```
