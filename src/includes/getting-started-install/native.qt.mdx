The Qt integration is part of the [`sentry-native`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-native/) SDK,
which currently supports Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android. Both Qt 5 and Qt 6 are supported.

To build the SDK, download the latest sources from the [Releases page](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-native/releases). The SDK is managed as a [CMake] project, which additionally supports several configuration options, such as the backend to use.

To enable the Qt integration set the `SENTRY_INTEGRATION_QT` option to `YES`.

<Note>

If the Qt libraries are not installed in one of the predefined `CMake` [system prefix paths](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH.html), where they can be found by `CMake`, you will need to set [`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.html) explicitly.

</Note>

For example (on macOS):

```shell
# Configure the cmake build into the `build` directory,
# with crashpad, and Qt integration (on macOS).
cmake -B build \
    -D SENTRY_BACKEND=crashpad \
    -D SENTRY_INTEGRATION_QT=YES \
    --config RelWithDebInfo \
    -S .

# Build the project
cmake --build build --config RelWithDebInfo --parallel

# Install the resulting artifacts into a specific prefix
cmake --install build --prefix install

# Which will result in the following (on macOS):
exa --tree install --level 2

<Alert level="warning" title="Bundling crashpad_handler">

When using the _Crashpad backend_, which is the default on Windows and macOS, the `crashpad_handler` binary has to be shipped alongside the application binary. See the [Crashpad documentation](/platforms/native/configuration/backends/crashpad/) for more information.

</Alert>
