To install the Android SDK, add it your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy {filename:build.gradle}
// Make sure mavenCentral is there.
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

// Enable Java 1.8 source compatibility if you haven't yet.
android {
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
}

// Add Sentry's SDK as a dependency.
dependencies {
    implementation 'io.sentry:sentry-android:{{ packages.version('sentry.java.android', '4.2.0') }}'
}
```

<Note>

[NDK integration](/platforms/android/using-ndk/) is packed with the SDK and requires API level 16, though other levels are supported.

Sentry's Android SDK depends on [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) as a transitive dependency; the minimum required version is 2.7.
