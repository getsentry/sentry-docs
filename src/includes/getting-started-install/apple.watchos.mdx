The minimum version for watchOS is 2.0. Our SDK has limited symbolication support and no crash handling for watchOS.

We recommend installing the SDK with CocoaPods. To integrate Sentry into your Xcode project, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :watchos, '2.0'
use_frameworks! # This is important

target 'YourApp' do
  pod 'Sentry', :git => 'https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa.git', :tag => '{{ packages.version('sentry.cocoa') }}'
end
```

Then run `pod install`.

We also support alternate [installation methods](install/).
