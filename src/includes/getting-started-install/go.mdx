When using Go Modules, you do not need to install anything to start using Sentry with your Go program. Import the SDK and the `go` tool will automatically download the latest version of the SDK when you next build your program.

```go
import (
	"github.com/getsentry/sentry-go"
)
```

With or without Go Modules, to use the latest version of the SDK, run:

```shell
go get github.com/getsentry/sentry-go
```

Consult the [Go documentation on Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#how-to-upgrade-and-downgrade-dependencies) for more information on how to manage dependencies.
