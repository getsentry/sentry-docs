Install the package via the [Unity Package Manager using a Git URL](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html) to Sentry's SDK repository:

```
https://github.com/getsentry/unity.git#{{ packages.version('sentry.dotnet.unity', '0.0.5') }}
```
<Note>

Confirm the URL doesn't have a trailing whitespace at the end. The Unity Package Manager will fail to find the package if a trailing whitespace is appended.

<Note>

Some Unity versions such as `2019.4.24f1` and `2020.3.2f1` have a bug on UPM and fail to install with the error `'HEAD': cannot update ref 'refs/heads/master'`. 

Unity has resolved this issue on newer releases. More information on [Unity Issue Tracker](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/package-resolution-error-when-using-a-git-dependency-referencing-an-annotated-tag-in-its-git-url).
