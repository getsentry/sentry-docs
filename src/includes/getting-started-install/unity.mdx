Install the SDK from [`Unity UPM`](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui.html) using a Git URL to Sentry's SDK repository:

```
https://github.com/getsentry/unity.git#{{ packages.version('sentry.dotnet.unity', '0.0.5') }}
```
<Note>

Confirm there's no empty space at the end of the line. The Unity Package Manager will fail to find the package if an empty space is appended to the end of the URL.

</Note>
