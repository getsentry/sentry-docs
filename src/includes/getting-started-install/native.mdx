The Native SDK currently supports **Windows**, **macOS**, **Linux**, and **Android**.

To build the SDK, download the latest release of the SDK from the [Releases page](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-native/releases). The SDK is managed as a [CMake] project, which additionally supports several configuration options, such as the backend to use.

For example, `CMake` can be used like this (on macOS):

```shell
# configure the cmake build into the `build` directory, with crashpad (on macOS)
cmake -B build -D SENTRY_BACKEND=crashpad --config RelWithDebInfo 
# build the project
cmake --build build --config RelWithDebInfo --parallel
# install the resulting artifacts into a specific prefix
cmake --install build --prefix install
# which will result in the following (on macOS):
exa --tree install
install
├── bin
│  └── crashpad_handler
├── include
│  └── sentry.h
└── lib
   ├── libsentry.dylib
   └── libsentry.dylib.dSYM
```

[cmake]: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/

<Alert level="warning" title="Bundling crashpad_handler">

When using the _Crashpad backend_, which is the default on Windows and macOS, the `crashpad_handler` binary has to be shipped alongside the application binary. See the [Crashpad documentation](configuration/backends/crashpad/) for more information.
