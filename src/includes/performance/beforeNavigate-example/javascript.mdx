One common use case is parameterizing transaction names. For both `pageload` and `navigation` transactions, the `BrowserTracing` integration uses the browser's `window.location` value to generate a transaction name. Using `beforeNavigate` you can modify the transaction name to make it more generic, so that, for example, transactions named `GET /users/12312012` and `GET /users/11212012` can both be renamed `GET /users/:userid`, so that they'll group together.

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  // ...
  integrations: [
    new Integrations.BrowserTracing({
      beforeNavigate: context => {
        return {
          ...context,
          // You could use your UI's routing library to find the matching
          // route template here. We don't have one right now, so do some basic
          // parameter replacements.
          name: location.pathname
            .replace(/\/[a-f0-9]{32}/g, "/<hash>")
            .replace(/\/\d+/g, "/<digits>"),
        };
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```
