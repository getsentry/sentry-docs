## Connect Errors with Spans

Sentry errors can be linked with transactions and spans.

Errors reported to Sentry while transaction or span **bound to the scope** is running are linked automatically:

```dart
import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';

final transaction = Sentry.startTransaction(
  'processOrderBatch()',
  'task',
  bindToScope: true,
);

try {
  processOrderBatch();
} catch (exception) {
  Sentry.captureException(exception);
} finally {
  await transaction.finish();
}
```

Exceptions may be thrown within spans that can finish before exception gets reported to Sentry. To attach span information to this exception, you must link it by calling the `throwable` setter method:

```dart
import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';

final transaction = Sentry.startTransaction('processOrderBatch()', 'task');

try {
  processOrderBatch();
} catch (exception) {
  transaction.throwable = exception;
  rethrow;
} finally {
  await transaction.finish();
}
```
