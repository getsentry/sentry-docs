To sample dynamically, set the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> option in your `Sentry.init()` to a function that will accept a <PlatformIdentifier name="sampling-context" /> object and return a sample rate between 0 and 1. For example:

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/traces-sampler-as-sampler" />

For convenience, the function can also return a boolean. Returning `true` is equivalent to returning `1`, and will guarantee the transaction will be sent to Sentry. Returning `false` is equivalent to returning `0` and will guarantee the transaction will **not** be sent to Sentry.
