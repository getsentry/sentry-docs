The information contained in the `samplingContext` object passed to the `tracesSampler` when a transaction is created varies by platform. For node-based SDKs, it includes the following:

```javascript
{
  transactionContext: {
    name: string; // human-readable identifier, like "GET /users"
    op: string; // short description of transaction type, like "pageload"
  }
  parentSampled: boolean; // if this transaction has a parent, its sampling decision
  request: object // in server contexts, information about the incoming request
  ... // custom context as passed to `startTransaction`
}
```
