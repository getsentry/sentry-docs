```ruby
Sentry.init do |config|
  # set a uniform sample rate between 0.0 and 1.0
  config.traces_sample_rate = 0.2

  # or control sampling dynamically
  config.traces_sampler = lambda do |sampling_context|
    # sampling_context[:transaction_context] contains the information about the transaction
    # sampling_context[:parent_sampled] contains the transaction's parent's sample decision
    true # return value can be a boolean or a float between 0.0 and 1.0
  end
end
