<Alert level="Info" title="Prior Versions">

If you use a version of our SDK prior to verison `3.0.0`, you will need to include the `ReactNativeTracing` integration to use automatic instrumentation.

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react-native";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  integrations: [
    new Sentry.ReactNativeTracing({
      tracingOrigins: ["localhost", "my-site-url.com", /^\//],
      // ... other options
    }),
  ],
});
```
