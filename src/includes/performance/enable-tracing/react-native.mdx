To enable automatic tracing, include the `ReactNativeTracing` integration in your SDK configuration options, if you have not already done so.

<Alert level="Info" title="Minimum Version">
To use ReactNativeTracing along with our included instrumentation, you will need at least version 2.2.0 of the Sentry React Native SDK.
</Alert>

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react-native";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  integrations: [
    new Sentry.ReactNativeTracing({
      tracingOrigins: ["localhost", "my-site-url.com", /^\//],
      // ... other options
    }),
  ],
});
```
