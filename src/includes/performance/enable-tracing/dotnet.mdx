To get started automatically sending traces you can:

- Set a uniform sample rate for all transactions, by setting the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> option in your SDK config to a number between `0` and `1`. (For example, to send 20% of transactions, set <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> to `0.2`.)
- Control the sample rate dynamically, based on the transaction itself and the context in which it's captured, by providing a function to the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> config option.

Or alternatively:

```csharp
using Sentry;

SentrySdk.Init(options =>
{
    options.Dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___";

    // To set a uniform sample rate
    options.TracesSampleRate = 1.0;

    // OR if you prefer, determine traces sample rate based on the sampling context
    options.TracesSampler = context =>
    {
        // Return a number between 0 and 1, or null (to fallback to configured value)
        return 1.0;
    };
});
```

If either of these options is set, tracing will be enabled in your app, and transactions will start getting captured automatically. If you set both options, <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> will take precedence, but can fallback to the value configured in <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> by returning `null`.

As you're getting tracing set up, we recommend setting <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> to `1`, so all created transactions are sent to Sentry. Once you're done with testing, though, you'll probably want to consider either **lowering your <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> value, or switching to <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" />**, which will allow you to set the sample rate individually for each transaction. Without sampling, automatically-captured transactions can add up quickly. (The ASP.NET Core integration, for example, will send a transaction for every request made to the server.) Sampling allows you to send representative data without overwhelming either your system or your Sentry transaction quota.
