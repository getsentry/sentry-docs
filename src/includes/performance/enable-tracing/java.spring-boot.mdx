To get started automatically sending traces you must enable tracing in `application.properties`:

```properties
sentry.enable-tracing=true
```

Next, you must choose one of two options to configure sampling:

- Set a uniform sample rate for all transactions, by setting the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> option in your SDK config to a number between `0` and `1`. (For example, to send 20% of transactions, set <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> to `0.2`.)
- Control the sample rate dynamically, based on the transaction itself and the context in which it's captured, by providing a function to the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> config option.

Or alternatively:

Configure sample rate in `application.properties` or `application.yml` file:

```properties
sentry.traces-sample-rate=0.3
```

Or through providing a bean of type `SentryOptions#TracesSamplerCallback`:

```java
@Component
class CustomTracesSamplerCallback {
  @Override
  public @NotNull Double sample(@NotNull SamplingContext samplingContext) {
    // return a number between 0 and 1
  }
}
```
