To get started automatically sending traces you can:

- Set a uniform sample rate for all transactions, by setting the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> option in your SDK config to a number between `0` and `1`. (For example, to send 20% of transactions, set <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> to `0.2`.)
- Control the sample rate dynamically, based on the transaction itself and the context in which it's captured, by providing a function to the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> config option.

Or alternatively:

```java {tabTitle:Java}
import io.sentry.Sentry;

Sentry.init(
  options -> {
    options.setDsn("___PUBLIC_DSN___");
    // To set a uniform sample rate
    options.setTracesSampleRate(1.0);
    // OR if you prefer, determine traces sample rate based on the sampling context
    options.setTracesSampler(
        context -> {
          // return a number between 0 and 1
        });
  });
```

```kotlin {tabTitle:Kotlin}
import io.sentry.Sentry
import io.sentry.SentryOptions.TracesSamplerCallback

Sentry.init {
    it.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    // To set a uniform sample rate
    it.tracesSampleRate = 1.0
    // OR if you prefer, determine traces sample rate based on the sampling context
    it.tracesSampler = TracesSamplerCallback {
        // return a number between 0 and 1
    }
}
```

If either of these options is set, tracing will be enabled in your app, and transactions will start getting captured automatically. (The two options are meant to be mutually exclusive, but if you do set both, <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> will take precedence.)

As you're getting tracing set up, we recommend setting <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> to `1`, so all created transactions are sent to Sentry. Once you're done with testing, though, you'll probably want to consider either **lowering your <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> value, or switching to <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" />**, which will allow you to set the sample rate individually for each transaction. Without sampling, automatically-captured transactions can add up quickly. (The Spring Boot integration, for example, will send a transaction for every request made to the server.) Sampling allows you to send representative data without overwhelming either your system or your Sentry transaction quota.
