For example:

- A frontend application is served from `example.com`
- A backend service is served from `api.example.com`
- The frontend application makes API calls to the backend
- The option can be configured for the built-in ember browser tracing: `browserTracingOptions: { tracingOrigins: ['api.example.com'] }}`
- Now outgoing XHR/fetch requests to `api.example.com` will get the `sentry-trace` header attached.

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/ember";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // To set a uniform sample rate
  tracesSampleRate: 0.2,

  browserTracingOptions: {
    tracingOrigins: ["localhost", "my-site-url.com", "api.example.com"],
  },
});
```
