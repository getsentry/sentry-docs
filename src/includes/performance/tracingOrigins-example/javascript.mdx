For example:

- A frontend application is served from `example.com`
- A backend service is served from `api.example.com`
- The frontend application makes API calls to the backend
- Therefore, the option needs to be configured like this: `new Integrations.BrowserTracing({tracingOrigins: ['api.example.com']})`
- Now outgoing XHR/fetch requests to `api.example.com` will get the `sentry-trace` header attached

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    new Integrations.BrowserTracing({
      tracingOrigins: ["localhost", "my-site-url.com"],
    }),
  ],

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```
