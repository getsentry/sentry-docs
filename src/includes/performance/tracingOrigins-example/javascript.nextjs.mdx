For example:

- A frontend application is served from `example.com`
- A backend service is served from `api.example.com`
- The frontend application makes API calls to the backend
- Set the `tracingOrigins` option to `['api.example.com']`
- Now outgoing XHR/fetch requests to `api.example.com` will get the `sentry-trace` header attached

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  // ...
  integrations: [
    new Sentry.Integrations.BrowserTracing({
      tracingOrigins: ["api.example.com"],
    }),
  ],
});
```
