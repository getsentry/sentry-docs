## Transactions for Async Tasks

Special care must be taken when spawning operations as independent threads or asynchronous tasks.

In situations where the computation can run longer than the calling context, you should always start a new transaction.
The SDK offers the `TransactionContext::continue_from_span` method to make that more convenient.

```rust
let parent_span = sentry::configure_scope(|scope| scope.get_span());
// Create a new transaction as an independent continuation
let ctx = sentry::TransactionContext::continue_from_span(
    "A long-running spawned task",
    "spawned_task",
    parent_span,
);

let task = async move {
  let transaction = sentry::start_transaction(ctx);
  // Set the newly created transaction as the *current span*
  sentry::configure_scope(|scope| scope.set_span(Some(transaction.clone().into())));

  // Do the actual computation
  // ...

  // Finish the span and send it to sentry
  transaction.finish();
  // The task gets a
}.bind_hub(Hub::new_from_top(Hub::current()));

task::spawn(task);
```
