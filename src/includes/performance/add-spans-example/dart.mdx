## Add More Spans to the Transaction

By default, transactions are not bound to the scope. Transaction has to be passed manually as a method parameter to enable attaching nested spans. When creating nested span, you can choose the value of `operation` and `description`.

```dart
import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';

final transaction = Sentry.startTransaction('processOrderBatch()', 'task');

try {
  processOrderBatch(transaction);
} catch (exception) {
  transaction.throwable = exception;
  transaction.status = SpanStatus.internalError();
} finally {
  transaction.finish();
}

void processOrderBatch(ISentrySpan span) {
  // span operation: task, span description: operation
  final innerSpan = span.startChild('task', description: 'operation');

  try {
    // omitted code
  } catch (exception) {
    innerSpan.throwable = exception;
    innerSpan.status = SpanStatus.notFound();
  } finally {
    innerSpan.finish();
  }
}
```

Keep in mind that each individual span also needs to be manually finished;

Spans are sent together with their parent transaction when the transaction is finished. Make sure to call `finish()` on transaction once all the child spans have finished.
