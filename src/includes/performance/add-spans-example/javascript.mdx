For example, if you want to create a transaction for a user interaction on your page:

```javascript
// Let's say this function is invoked when a user clicks on the checkout button of your shop
shopCheckout() {
  // This will create a new Transaction for you
  const transaction = Sentry.startTransaction({ name: "shopCheckout" });
  // set the transaction on the scope so it picks up any errors
  hub.configureScope(scope => scope.setSpan(transaction));

  // Assume this function makes an xhr/fetch call
  const result = validateShoppingCartOnServer();

  const span = transaction.startChild({
    data: {
      result
    },
    op: 'task',
    description: `processing shopping cart result`,
  });
  processAndValidateShoppingCart(result);
  span.finish();

  transaction.finish();
}
```

This example will send a transaction `shopCheckout` to Sentry. The transaction will contain a `task` span that measures how long `processAndValidateShoppingCart` took. Finally, the call to `transaction.finish()` will finish the transaction and send it to Sentry.

You can also take advantage of promises when creating spans for async operations. Keep in mind, though, that a span must finish before `transaction.finish()` is called to be included in the transaction.

For example:

```javascript
function processItem(item, transaction) {
  const span = transaction.startChild({
    op: "http",
    description: `GET /items/:item-id`,
  });

  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    http.get(`/items/${item.id}`, response => {
      response.on("data", () => {});
      response.on("end", () => {
        span.setTag("http.status_code", response.statusCode);
        span.setData("http.foobarsessionid", getFoobarSessionid(response));
        span.finish();
        resolve(response);
      });
    });
  });
}
```
