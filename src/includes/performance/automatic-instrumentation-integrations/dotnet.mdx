![Sample transaction  with Entity Framework Core Integration.](dotnet-ef-core-integration.png)

This integration is part of the `DiagnosticSource` integration and will automatically create spans for EF Core queries for the following operations:

`Query compiling`

: Occurs when EF Core optimizes a query. It then caches it so that future queries with the same input get reused.
The parameters for this span are:

* Operation: `db.query_compiler`

* Description: The query to be compiled


`Database connection`

: Represents the lifecycle of a database connection. One connection may contain one or more query execution spans, and, in some circumstances, may not be registered, due to the nature of the EF Core event model.
The parameters for this span are:

* Operation: `db.connection`

`Query Execution`

: Happens during the execution of a query. It represents how long a query took to be executed
The parameters for this span are:

* Operation: `db.query`

* Description: The query to be executed.
