To enable tracing, include the `BrowserTracing` integration in your SDK configuration options. (Note that when using ESM modules, the main `@sentry/react` import must come before the `@sentry/tracing` import.)

To use `react-router` integration, import and set a custom routing instrumentation using a custom history. Make sure you use a `Router` component combined with `createBrowserHistory` (or equivalent).

```javascript
import { Router } from 'react-router-dom';
import { createBrowserHistory } from 'history';

import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";
import { Integrations as TracingIntegrations } from "@sentry/tracing"; // Must import after @sentry/react

const history = createBrowserHistory();

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  integrations: [
    new Integrations.BrowserTracing({
      tracingOrigins: ["localhost", "my-site-url.com", /^\//],

      // Can also use reactRouterV3Instrumentation or reactRouterV4Instrumentation
      routingInstrumentation: Sentry.reactRouterV5Instrumentation(history),

      // ... other options
    }),
  ],

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

Now you should be generating `pageload`/`navigation` transactions from the `BrowserTracing` integration, using Sentry's [`react-router` instrumentation](/platforms/javascript/guides/react/configuration/integrations/react-router/).
