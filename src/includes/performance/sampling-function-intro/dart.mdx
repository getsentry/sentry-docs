To use the sampling function, set the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> option in your `Sentry.init()` to a function that will accept a <PlatformIdentifier name="sampling-context" /> dictionary and return a sample rate between 0 and 1. For example:

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/traces-sampler-as-sampler" />
