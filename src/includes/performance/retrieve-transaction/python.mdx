## Retrieve a Transaction

In cases where you want to attach Spans to an already ongoing Transaction you can use `Hub.current.scope.transaction`. This property will return a `Transaction` in case there is a running Transaction otherwise it returns `None`.

```python
from sentry_sdk import Hub

transaction = Hub.current.scope.transaction

if transaction is None:
    with sentry_sdk.start_transaction(name="task"):
        do_task()
else:
    transaction.name = "new name"
    with transaction.start_child(op="task"):  # equivalent to `sentry_sdk.start_span`
        do_task()
```

## Retrieve the Current Span

Started spans are stored in the scope, and can be fetched off the scope:

```python
from sentry_sdk import Hub

span = Hub.current.scope.span

if span is None:
    # no span in progress, create new transaction
    with start_transaction(name="task"):
        do_task()
else:
    # new task span as child of current span
    with span.start_child(op="task"):
        do_task()
```
