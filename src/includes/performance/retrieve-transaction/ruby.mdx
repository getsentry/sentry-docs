In cases where you want to attach Spans to an already ongoing Transaction you can use `Sentry.get_current_scope.get_transaction`. This property will return a `Transaction` in case there is a running Transaction otherwise it returns `None`.

```ruby
transaction = Sentry.get_current_scope.get_transaction || Sentry.start_transaction(name: "task")

span = transaction.start_child(op: "operation")
# perform the operation
```

### Retrieving the Current Span

Started spans are stored in the scope, and can be fetched off the scope:

```python
from sentry_sdk import Hub

span = Hub.current.scope.span

if span is None:
    # no span in progress, create new transaction
    with start_transaction(name="task"):
        do_task()
else:
    # new task span as child of current span
    with span.start_child(op="task"):
        do_task()
```
