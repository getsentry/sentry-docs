```python
{
  "transaction_context": {
    "name": <string>  # human-readable identifier, like "GET /users"
    "op": <string>  # short description of transaction type, like "http.request"
  },
  "parent_sampled": <bool>  # if this transaction has a parent, its sampling decision
  ...  # custom context as passed to `start_transaction`

```
