For Java-based SDKs, it includes at least the following:

```javascript
// contents of `samplingContext`
{
  transactionContext: {
    name: string; // human-readable identifier, like "GET /users"
    parentSampled: boolean; // if this transaction has a parent, its sampling decision
  }
  customSamplingContext: {
    data: {
        ... // custom context as passed to `startTransaction`
    }
  }
}
```
