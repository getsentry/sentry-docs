For Ruby-based SDKs, it includes at least the following:

```ruby
{
  transaction_context: {
    name: <string>  # human-readable identifier, like "GET /users"
    op: <string>  # short description of transaction type, like "rack.request"
  },
  parent_sampled: <bool>  # if this transaction has a parent, its sampling decision
  ...  # custom context as passed to `start_transaction`
}
```
