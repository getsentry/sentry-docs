```javascript
// contents of `samplingContext`
{
  transactionContext: {
    name: string; // human-readable identifier, like "GET /users"
    op: string; // short description of transaction type, like "pageload"
  }
  parentSampled: boolean; // if this transaction has a parent, its sampling decision
  location: Location | WorkerLocation; // the window.location or self.location object
  ... // custom context as passed to `startTransaction`
}
```
