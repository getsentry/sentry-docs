### Navigation and Other XHR Requests

For traces that begin in the front end, any requests made (and any requests your backend makes as a result) are linked through the request header `sentry-trace`.

All of Sentry's tracing-related integrations (`BrowserTracing`, `Http`, and `Express`), as well as the Next.JS SDK, either generate or pick up and propagate the trace header automatically, as appropriate, for all transactions and spans that they generate.

The JavaScript SDK will only attach the trace header to outgoing HTTP requests for which the destination is a substring or regex match to the <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#tracingorigins">tracingOrigins</PlatformLink> list.

<!-- copied from automatic-instrumentation to emphasize this point -->

You'll need to configure your web server [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Headers) to allow the `sentry-trace` header. The configuration might look like `"Access-Control-Allow-Headers: sentry-trace"`, but the configuration depends on your setup. If you don't allow the `sentry-trace` header, the request might be blocked.

### Pageload

For traces that begin in your backend, you can connect the automatically-generated `pageload` transaction on the frontend with the request transaction that serves the page on the backend. Because JavaScript code running in a browser cannot read the response headers of the current page, the `trace_id` must be transmitted in the response itself, specifically in a `<meta>` tag in the `<head>` of the HTML sent from your backend.

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <meta name="sentry-trace" content="{{ span.toSentryTrace() }}" />
    <!-- ... -->
  </head>
</html>
```

The `name` attribute must be the string `"sentry-trace"` and the `content` attribute must be generated by your backend Sentry SDK using `span.toSentryTrace()` (or equivalent, depending on the backend platform). This guarantees that a new and unique value will be generated for each request.

<Note>

The `span.toSentryTrace()` was previously called `span.toTraceparent()`, so that's what you may find depending on the SDK and version.

</Note>

The `span` reference is either the transaction that serves the HTML or any of its child spans. It defines the parent of the `pageload` transaction.

Once the data is included in the `<meta>` tag, our `BrowserTracing` integration will pick it up automatically and link it to the transaction generated on pageload. (Note that it will not be linked to automatically-generated `navigation` transactions â€” that is, those that don't require a full page reload. Each of those will be the result of a different request transaction on the backend and, therefore, should have a unique `trace_id`.)
