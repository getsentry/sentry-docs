The `BrowserTracing` integration creates a new transaction for each page load and navigation event, and creates a child span for every `XMLHttpRequest` or `fetch` request that occurs while those transactions are open. The `withSentry` wrapper creates a transaction for every API request. Learn more about [traces, transactions, and spans](/product/sentry-basics/tracing/distributed-tracing/).
