```ruby
Sentry.init do |config|
  config.traces_sampler = lambda do |sampling_context|
    # transaction_context is the transaction object in hash form
    # keep in mind that sampling happens right after the transaction is initialized
    # e.g. at the beginning of the request
    transaction_context = sampling_context[:transaction_context]

    # with transaction_context, you can sample transactions more sophisticatedly
    # for example, you can give different rates based on the operation
    op = transaction_context[:op]
    if op.match? /request/
      # and filter request transactions based on their routes
      if transaction_context[:name].match? /health_check/
        false # skip health check requests
      else
        0.1 # the rate for other requests
      end
    elsif op.match? /sidekiq/
      0.001 # you may want to set a lower rate for background jobs if the number is large
    end
  end
end
