```csharp
using Sentry;

// Add this to the SDK initialization callback
// To set a uniform sample rate
options.TracesSampleRate = 1.0;

// OR: Determine traces sample rate based on the sampling context
options.TracesSampler = context =>
{
    // If this is the continuation of a trace, just use that decision (rate controlled by the caller)
    if (context.TransactionContext.IsParentSampled is not null)
    {
        return context.TransactionContext.IsParentSampled.Value
            ? 1.0
            : 0.0;
    }

    // Otherwise, sample based on URL (exposed through custom sampling context)
    return context.CustomSamplingContext.GetValueOrDefault("url") switch
    {
        // These are important - take a big sample
        "/payment" => 0.5,

        // Search is less important and happen much more frequently - only take 1%
        "/search" => 0.01,

        // The health check endpoint is just noise - drop all transactions
        "/health" => 0.0,

        // Default sample rate
        _ => 0.1

        // Or return null to fallback to options.TracesSampleRate (1.0 in this case)
        // _ => null
    };
