```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react-native";

// Unlike Sentry on other platforms, you do not need to import anything to use tracing on React Native

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // To set a uniform sample rate
  tracesSampleRate: 0.2

  // Alternatively, to control sampling dynamically
  tracesSampler: samplingContext => { ... }
});
```
