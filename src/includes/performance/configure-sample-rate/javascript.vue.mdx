```javascript {tabTitle: ESM}
import Vue from "vue";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/vue";

// If taking advantage of automatic instrumentation (highly recommended)
import { Integrations } from "@sentry/tracing";
// Or, if only manually tracing
// import * as _ from "@sentry/tracing"
// Note: You MUST import the package in some way for tracing to work

Sentry.init({
  // Passing in `Vue` is optional, if you do not pass it `window.Vue` must be present.
  Vue: Vue,
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // This enables automatic instrumentation (highly recommended), but is not
  // necessary for purely manual usage
  integrations: [new Integrations.BrowserTracing()],

  // To set a uniform sample rate
  tracesSampleRate: 0.2

  // Alternatively, to control sampling dynamically
  tracesSampler: samplingContext => { ... }
});
```

```javascript {tabTitle: CDN}
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // This enables automatic instrumentation (highly recommended), but is not
  // necessary for purely manual usage
  integrations: [new Sentry.Integrations.BrowserTracing()],

  // To set a uniform sample rate
  tracesSampleRate: 0.2

  // Alternatively, to control sampling dynamically
  tracesSampler: samplingContext => { ... }
});
```

### Tracking Child Components

If you want to track child components, and see more details about the rendering process, configure the integration to track them all:

```js
Sentry.init({
  Vue,
  tracingOptions: {
    trackComponents: true,
  },
});
```
