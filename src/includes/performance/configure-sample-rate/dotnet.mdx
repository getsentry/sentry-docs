To get started automatically sending traces you can:

- Set a uniform sample rate for all transactions, by setting the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> option in your SDK config to a number between `0` and `1`. (For example, to send 20% of transactions, set <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> to `0.2`.)
- Control the sample rate dynamically, based on the transaction itself and the context in which it's captured, by providing a function to the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> config option.

Or alternatively:

```csharp
using Sentry;

SentrySdk.Init(options =>
{
    options.Dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___";

    // To set a uniform sample rate
    options.TracesSampleRate = 1.0;

    // OR if you prefer, determine traces sample rate based on the sampling context
    options.TracesSampler = context =>
    {
        // Return a number between 0 and 1, or null (to fallback to configured value)
        return 1.0;
    };
});
```
