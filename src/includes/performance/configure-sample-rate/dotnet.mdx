```csharp
using Sentry;

SentrySdk.Init(options =>
{
    options.Dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___";

    // Example uniform sample rate: capture 100% of transactions
    options.TracesSampleRate = 1.0;

    // OR if you prefer, determine traces sample rate based on the sampling context
    options.TracesSampler = context =>
    {
        // Return a number between 0 and 1, or null (to fallback to configured value)
        return 1.0;
    };
});
