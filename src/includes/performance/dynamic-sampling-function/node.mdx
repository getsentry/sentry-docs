```javascript
tracesSampler: samplingContext => {
  // Examine provided context data (including parent decision, if any) along
  // with anything in the global namespace to compute the sample rate or
  // sampling decision for this transaction

  if ("...") {
    return 0.5; // These are important - take a big sample
  } else if ("...") {
    return 0.01; // These are less important or happen much more frequently - only take 1% of them
  } else if ("...") {
    return 0; // These aren't something worth tracking - drop all transactions like this
  } else {
    return 0.1; // Default sample rate
  }
};
```
