```bash
npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i sourcemaps
```

The wizard will guide you through the following steps:

- Connecting your local project to Sentry
- Installing the necessary Sentry packages
- Configuring your build tool to generate and upload source maps
- Configuring your CI to upload source maps

<Alert level="warning">

Configuring source maps upload with the Sentry Wizard is still experimental and [under development](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-wizard/issues/290).
Let us know on [GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-wizard/issues/new/choose) if you have feedback or issues.
