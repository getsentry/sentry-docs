You can trigger your first event from your development environment by raising an exception somewhere within your application. An example of this would be rendering a button:

```JSX
return <button onClick={methodDoesNotExist}>Break the world</button>;
```

Resolve the created error by logging in to Sentry, then opening your project. On the **Issue Details** page, scroll down to the Exception stack trace and view the error.
