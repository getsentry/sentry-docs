```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.crash()
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK crash];
```

## Crash Handling

Our SDK hooks into all signal and exception handlers, except for MacOS. If you are using MacOS, please follow the additional steps documented in [Capturing Uncaught Exceptions in macOS](/platforms/apple/usage/#capturing-uncaught-exceptions-in-macos).

To try it out, the SDK provides a test crash function:

```swift
import Sentry

SentrySDK.crash()
```

```objective-C
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK crash];
```

Crashes are submitted only upon re-launch of the application. If you crash with a debugger attached, nothing will happen. To view the crash in Sentry, close your app and re-launch it.
