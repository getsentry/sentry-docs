```python
@app.route('/debug-sentry')
def trigger_error():
    division_by_zero = 1 / 0
```

After initialization:

- If you use `flask-login` and have set `send_default_pii=True` in your call to `init`, user data (current user id, email address, username) is attached to the event.
- Request data is attached to all events: **HTTP method, URL, headers, form data, JSON payloads**. Sentry excludes raw bodies and multipart file uploads.
- Logs emitted by `app.logger` or _any_ logger are recorded as breadcrumbs by the [Logging](/platforms/python/guides/logging/) integration (this integration is enabled by default).
