```py
from django.urls import path

def trigger_error(request):
    division_by_zero = 1 / 0

urlpatterns = [
    path('sentry-debug/', trigger_error),
    # ...
]
```

Visiting this route will trigger an error that will be captured by Sentry.

After initialization:
- If you use `django.contrib.auth` and have set `send_default_pii=True` in your call to `init`, user data (current user id, email address, username) is attached to the event.
- Request data is attached to all events: **HTTP method, URL, headers, form data, JSON payloads**. Sentry excludes raw bodies and multipart file uploads.
- Logging with any logger creates breadcrumbs when the [Logging](/platforms/python/guides/logging/) integration, which is enabled by default.

### Keyword Arguments

You can also pass the following keyword arguments to `DjangoIntegration()`:

- `transaction_style`:

  ```python
  def my_function(request):
      return "ok"

  urlpatterns = [
      url(r"^myurl/(?P<myid>\d+)/$", my_function)
  ]
  ```

  In the above code, you would set the transaction to:

  - `/myurl/{myid}` if you set `transaction_style="url"`. This matches the behavior of the deprecated Raven SDK.
  - `my_function` if you set `transaction_style="function_name"`

  The default is `"url"`.

### Status Codes

If you want to report `404 Not Found` and other errors besides uncaught exceptions (`500 Internal Server Error`) to Sentry, you can write your own Django view for those status codes. For example:

```python

# urls.py

handler404 = 'mysite.views.my_custom_page_not_found_view'

# views.py

from django.http import HttpResponseNotFound
from sentry_sdk import capture_message


def my_custom_page_not_found_view(*args, **kwargs):
    capture_message("Page not found!", level="error")

    # return any response here, e.g.:
    return HttpResponseNotFound("Not found")
```

The error message you send to Sentry will have the usual request data attached.

Refer to [Customizing Error Views](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/http/views/#customizing-error-views) from the Django documentation for more information. You can also view our [troubleshooting information](/platforms/python/guides/django/troubleshooting/).
