```py
from django.urls import path

def trigger_error(request):
    division_by_zero = 1 / 0

urlpatterns = [
    path('sentry-debug/', trigger_error),
    # ...
]
```

Visiting this route will trigger an error that will be captured by Sentry.

After initialization:
- If you use `django.contrib.auth` and have set `send_default_pii=True` in your call to `init`, user data (current user id, email address, username) is attached to the event.
- Request data is attached to all events: **HTTP method, URL, headers, form data, JSON payloads**. Sentry excludes raw bodies and multipart file uploads.
- Logging with any logger creates breadcrumbs when the [Logging](/platforms/python/guides/logging/) integration, which is enabled by default.
