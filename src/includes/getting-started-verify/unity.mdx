In addition to errors, Sentry also captures Unity's `Debug.Log` and `Debug.LogWarning` as [breadcrumbs](/product/issues/issue-details/breadcrumbs/). Take note that they are affected by [event debouncing](/platforms/unity/configuration/event-debouncing/).

```csharp
using Sentry;
using UnityEngine;

public class TestMonoBehaviour : MonoBehaviour
{
    private GameObject testObject = null;

    void Start()
    {
        // This will throw a Null Reference Exception
        testObject.GetComponent<Transform>();   // Captured error

        Debug.Log("Captured Log");              // Breadcrumb
        Debug.LogWarning("Captured Warning");   // Breadcrumb
        Debug.LogError("Captured Error");       // Captured error
    }
}
```
