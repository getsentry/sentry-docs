## Jakarta support

<Note>

This feature is available on Sentry Java SDK `6.0.0-alpha.6` and above. Features available in Beta are still in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.

</Note>

We also provide a module called `sentry-servlet-jakarta` if you want to use `jakarta.servlet-api` instead of `javax.servlet-api`.
