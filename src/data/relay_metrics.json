Sometimes, crashes require that\nevents are sent after restarting the application. Similarly, SDKs buffer events during\nnetwork downtimes for later transmission. This metric measures the delay between the time of\nthe event and the time it arrives in Relay. The delay is measured after clock drift\ncorrection is applied.\n\nOnly payloads with a delay of more than 1 minute are captured.\n\nThis metric is tagged with:\n\n- `category`: The data category of the payload.
