title: Rate Limits

Sentry rate limits every API request made to prevent abuse and resource overuse. The limit is applied to each unique combination of caller and endpoint.

The rate limit follows a fixed window approach. Requests are counted into time buckets, determined by the window size. If the number of requests from a caller exceeds the number of allowed requests within a window, then that request will be rejected.

While there is a default value, each endpoint can have their own maximum number of requests and window size. You can track your rate limit usage by looking at special headers in the response.

## Headers

Every API request response includes the following headers:

- `X-Sentry-Rate-Limit-Limit`
  - The maximum number of requests allowed within the window
- `X-Sentry-Rate-Limit-Remaining`
  - The number of requests this caller has left on this endpoint within the current window
- `X-Sentry-Rate-Limit-Reset`
  - The time when the next rate limit window begins and the count resets, measured in UTC seconds from epoch

## Additional Information

The rate limiter looks at the caller's identity instead of the bearer token or cookie. As such, the rate limit cannot be bypassed by generating multiple tokens.

Rate limits for internal integrations may differ from other rate limits, and tend to be higher. We recommend using internal integration bearer tokens if you anticipate needing to make a large volume of calls.
