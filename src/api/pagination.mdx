title: Paginating Results
sidebar_order: 4

Pagination in the API is handled via the Link header standard:

```bash
curl -i https://sentry.io/api/0/projects/1/groups/
```

```http
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Date: Sat, 14 Feb 2015 18:47:20 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Language: en
Allow: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS
Link: <https://sentry.io/api/0/projects/1/groups/?&cursor=1420837590:0:1>;
  rel="previous"; results="false",
  <https://sentry.io/api/0/projects/1/groups/?&cursor=1420837533:0:0>;
  rel="next"; results="true"
```

When supported, cursors will **always** be returned for both a previous and a next page, even if there are no results on these pages. This allows you to make a query against the API for yet-undiscovered results. An example where this would be used is when you’re implementing polling behavior and you want to see if there is any new data. We return a `results="[true|false]"` indicator to determine if you actually need to paginate.
