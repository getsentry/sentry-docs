title: "Tutorial: Create and List Teams with the Sentry API"
sidebar_order: 7
---

This guide walks you through the basics of using Sentry's API to list the teams in an organization and create a new team.

APIs used in this tutorial:

- [List an Organization's Teams](/api/teams/list-an-organizations-teams/)
- [Create a New Team](/api/teams/create-a-new-team/)

## Prerequisites

- A Sentry authentication token with team:write scopes or higher and project:read scopes or higher.

  > If you don't have an authentication token, follow the [Create a Sentry Authentication Token](/api/guides/create-auth-token) tutorial to create an organization auth token with the following permissions, or higher:

    - Organization: Read
    - Team: Write

We recommend using a free [Sentry developer account](https://sentry.io/pricing/) for this tutorial.

## List an Organization's Teams

First, you will use the [List an Organization's Teams](/api/teams/list-an-organizations-teams/) API to list all the teams in our organization.

### Find your organization ID

The list teams API requires you to pass in the an organization id to list teams for.

You can find your organization ID in the browser URL of your Sentry instance. For example, https://test-org.sentry.io/.

### Run the command

1. Open your terminal.

1. Save your auth token and organization ID as environment variables for ease of use. Paste the following commands into your terminal, replacing `<organization_id>` with your organization ID and `<auth_token>` with the auth token you copied previously:

   ```bash
   export SENTRY_ORG_ID=<organization_id>
   export SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=<auth_token>
   ```

1. Paste the following cURL command into your terminal:

   ```bash
   curl "https://sentry.io/api/0/organizations/$SENTRY_ORG_ID/teams/?detailed=0" \
       -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN
   ```

1. Here's an example of what the output of the command should be, for an organization that has a team called "test-team":

   ```json
   [
     {
       "id": "4505449964175360",
       "slug": "test-team",
       "name": "test-team",
       "dateCreated": "2023-06-30T18:44:59.196618Z",
       "isMember": false,
       "teamRole": null,
       "flags": {
         "idp:provisioned": false
       },
       "access": [
         "alerts:read",
         "team:read",
         "member:read",
         "org:read",
         "project:releases",
         "project:read",
         "event:write",
         "event:read"
       ],
       "hasAccess": true,
       "isPending": false,
       "memberCount": 1,
       "avatar": {
         "avatarType": "letter_avatar",
         "avatarUuid": null
       },
       "orgRole": null
     }
   ]
   ```

   The output gives you details about the teams within the specified organization.

   If your organization has enough teams, the API will return paginated results. See our docs on [Pagination](/api/pagination/) to learn how to handle paginated results.

1. [Optional] To list information about the projects associated with each team you can use the set the `detailed` query parameter to `1`:

   ```bash
   curl "https://sentry.io/api/0/organizations/$SENTRY_ORG_ID/teams/?detailed=1" \
       -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN
   ```

   Here's an example of what that output might look like if "test-team" has one associated project named "test-project":

   ```json
   [
       {
       ...
           "orgRole": null,
           "externalTeams": [],
           "projects": [
               {
                   "id": "4505506997403648",
                   "slug": "test-project",
                   "name": "test-project",
                   "platform": "javascript-react",
                   "dateCreated": "2023-07-10T20:29:17.426792Z",
                   "isBookmarked": false,
                   "isMember": false,
                   "features": [
                       "alert-filters",
                       "minidump",
                       "race-free-group-creation",
                       "similarity-indexing",
                       "similarity-view",
                       "releases"
                   ],
                   "firstEvent": "2023-07-10T20:39:35.811000Z",
                   "firstTransactionEvent": true,
                   "access": [],
                   "hasAccess": true,
                   "hasMinifiedStackTrace": true,
                   "hasMonitors": false,
                   "hasProfiles": false,
                   "hasReplays": true,
                   "hasSessions": true,
                   "isInternal": false,
                   "isPublic": false,
                   "avatar": {
                       "avatarType": "letter_avatar",
                       "avatarUuid": null
                   },
                   "color": "#bf853f",
                   "status": "active"
               }
           ]
       }
   ]
   ```

## Create a Team

Now that you know what teams already exist in your org, use the [Create a New Team](/api/teams/create-a-new-team/) API to create another.

1. Make sure your auth token and organization ID are both still stored as environment variables in your shell.

1. Paste the following cURL command into your terminal:

   ```bash
   curl -d "name=tutorial-team" -X POST "https://sentry.io/api/0/organizations/$SENTRY_ORG_ID/teams/" \
       -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN
   ```

   The `name` query parameter means the name of the created team should be "tutorial-team".

1. Here's an example of what the output of the command should be:

   ```json
   {
     "id": "4505524553711616",
     "slug": "tutorial-team",
     "name": "tutorial-team",
     "dateCreated": "2023-07-13T22:54:05.074990Z",
     "isMember": false,
     "teamRole": null,
     "flags": {
       "idp:provisioned": false
     },
     "access": [
       "event:write",
       "member:read",
       "alerts:read",
       "project:releases",
       "project:read",
       "event:read",
       "team:read",
       "org:read"
     ],
     "hasAccess": true,
     "isPending": false,
     "memberCount": 0,
     "avatar": {
       "avatarType": "letter_avatar",
       "avatarUuid": null
     },
     "orgRole": null
   }
   ```

1. [Optional] To create a team where the `slug` value is different than the `name` value, you can specify both in your POST call, like so:

   ```bash
   curl -d "name=tutorial-team&slug=tutorial-team-slug" -X POST "https://sentry.io/api/0/organizations/$SENTRY_ORG_ID/teams/" \
       -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN
   ```

## List an Organization's Teams

Finally, call the [List an Organization's Teams](/api/teams/list-an-organizations-teams/) API one more time to make sure your new team is returned.

1. Make sure your auth token and organization ID are both still stored as environment variables in your shell.

1. Paste the following cURL command into your terminal:

   ```bash
   curl "https://sentry.io/api/0/organizations/$SENTRY_ORG_ID/teams/?detailed=0" \
       -H 'Authorization: Bearer '$SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN
   ```

1. Your response should contain an entry for your new "tutorial-team" and look something like this:

   ```json
   [
     {
       "id": "4505524236910592",
       "slug": "test-team",
       "name": "test-team",
       "dateCreated": "2023-07-13T21:33:31.686812Z",
       "isMember": false,
       "teamRole": null,
       "flags": {
         "idp:provisioned": false
       },
       "access": [
         "member:read",
         "alerts:read",
         "org:read",
         "project:read",
         "team:read",
         "project:releases",
         "event:read",
         "event:write"
       ],
       "hasAccess": true,
       "isPending": false,
       "memberCount": 1,
       "avatar": {
         "avatarType": "letter_avatar",
         "avatarUuid": null
       },
       "orgRole": null
     },
     {
       "id": "4505524616167424",
       "slug": "tutorial-team",
       "name": "tutorial-team",
       "dateCreated": "2023-07-13T23:09:58.243168Z",
       "isMember": false,
       "teamRole": null,
       "flags": {
         "idp:provisioned": false
       },
       "access": [
         "member:read",
         "alerts:read",
         "org:read",
         "project:read",
         "team:read",
         "project:releases",
         "event:read",
         "event:write"
       ],
       "hasAccess": true,
       "isPending": false,
       "memberCount": 0,
       "avatar": {
         "avatarType": "letter_avatar",
         "avatarUuid": null
       },
       "orgRole": null
     }
   ]
   ```
