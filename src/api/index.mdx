The Sentry web API is used to access the Sentry platform programmatically. You can use the APIs to manage account-level resources, like organizations and teams, as well as manage and export data.

If you're looking for information about the API surface for Sentry's SDKs, see the [SDK Development](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/overview/) docs.

## Versioning
