title: API Reference
---

The Sentry API is used for submitting events to the Sentry collector as well as exporting and managing data. The reporting and web APIs are individually versioned. This document refers to the web APIs only. For information about the reporting API see [_SDK Development_](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/overview/).

## Versioning

The current version of the web API is known as **v0** and is considered to be in a draft phase. While we donâ€™t expect public endpoints to change greatly, keep in mind that the API is still under development.

## Getting Started

- [Requests](/api/requests/)
- [Authentication](/api/auth/)
