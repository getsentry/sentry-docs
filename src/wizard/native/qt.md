Install the SDK by downloading the [latest release](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-native/releases). Next, follow the
instructions in the [_Native SDK Documentation_](/platforms/native/guides/qt/) to build the SDK library.

Import and initialize the Sentry SDK early in your application setup:

```cpp
#include <QtWidgets>
#include <sentry.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    sentry_options_t *options = sentry_options_new();
    sentry_options_set_dsn(options, "___PUBLIC_DSN___");
    sentry_init(options);

    // Make sure everything flushes
    auto sentryClose = qScopeGuard([] { sentry_close(); });

    QApplication app(argc, argv);
    /* ... */
    return app.exec();
}
```

Alternatively, the DSN can be passed as `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable during
runtime. This can be especially useful for server applications.

The quickest way to verify Sentry in your Qt application is by capturing a message:

```c
sentry_capture_event(sentry_value_new_message_event(
  /*   level */ SENTRY_LEVEL_INFO,
  /*  logger */ "custom",
  /* message */ "It works!"
));
```
