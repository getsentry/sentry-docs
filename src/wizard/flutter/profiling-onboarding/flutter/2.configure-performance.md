#### Configure Performance

Sentryâ€™s performance monitoring product has to be enabled in order for Profiling to work. To enable performance monitoring in the SDK:

```dart
SentryFlutter.init(
  (options) => {
    options.dsn = '___PUBLIC_DSN___';
    // We recommend adjusting this value in production:
    options.tracesSampleRate = 1.0;
  },
  appRunner: () => runApp(MyApp()),
);
```
