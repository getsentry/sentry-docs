#### Configure Profiling

Add the `ProfilesSampleRate` option to your SDK config.

```dart
SentryFlutter.init(
  (options) => {
    options.dsn = '___PUBLIC_DSN___';
    // We recommend adjusting this value in production:
    options.tracesSampleRate = 1.0;
    // The sampling rate for profiling is relative to tracesSampleRate
    // Setting to 1.0 will profile 100% of sampled transactions:
    options.profilesSampleRate = 1.0;
  },
  appRunner: () => runApp(MyApp()),
);
```
