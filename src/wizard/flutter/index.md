Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your applicationâ€™s runtime. Add the following to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yml {filename:pubspec.yaml}
dependencies:
  sentry_flutter: ^{{ packages.version('sentry.dart.flutter') }}
```

Import `sentry_flutter` and initialize it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  await SentryFlutter.init(
    (options) {
      options.dsn = '___PUBLIC_DSN___';
    },
    appRunner: () => runApp(MyApp()),
  );

  // or define SENTRY_DSN via Dart environment variable (--dart-define)
}  
```

Then create an intentional error, so you can test that everything is working:

```dart
import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';

try {
  aMethodThatMightFail();
} catch (exception, stackTrace) {
  await Sentry.captureException(
    exception,
    stackTrace: stackTrace,
  );
}
```
