Install the **NuGet** package:

Package Manager:

```shell
Install-Package Sentry.AspNet -Version {{@inject packages.version('sentry.dotnet.aspnet') }}
```

Using Entity Framework 6?

```shell
Install-Package Sentry.EntityFramework -Version {{@inject packages.version('sentry.dotnet.ef') }}
```

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><h5 class="no_toc">Using .NET Framework prior to 4.6.1?</h5>
    <div class="alert-body content-flush-bottom">
        <a href="https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/dotnet/legacy-sdk/">Our legacy SDK</a> supports .NET Framework as early as 3.5.
    </div>
</div>

You should `init` the Sentry SDK as soon as possible during your application load by adding Sentry to `Global.asax.cs`:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Configuration;
using System.Web.Mvc;
using System.Web.Routing;
using Sentry;
using Sentry.AspNet;
using Sentry.EntityFramework; // if you installed Sentry.EntityFramework

public class MvcApplication : HttpApplication
{
    private IDisposable _sentry;

    protected void Application_Start()
    {
        // Initialize Sentry to capture AppDomain unhandled exceptions and more.
        _sentry = SentrySdk.Init(o =>
        {
            o.AddAspNet();
            o.Dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___";
            // When configuring for the first time, to see what the SDK is doing:
            o.Debug = true;
            // Set TracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
            // of transactions for performance monitoring.
            // We recommend adjusting this value in production
            o.TracesSampleRate = 1.0;
            // If you are using EF (and installed the NuGet package):
            o.AddEntityFramework();
        });
    }

    // Global error catcher
    protected void Application_Error() => Server.CaptureLastError();

    protected void Application_BeginRequest()
    {
        Context.StartSentryTransaction();
    }

    protected void Application_EndRequest()
    {
        Context.FinishSentryTransaction();
    }

    protected void Application_End()
    {
        // Flushes out events before shutting down.
        _sentry?.Dispose();
    }
}
```

### Documentation

Once you've verified the package is initialized properly and sent a test event, consider visiting our [complete ASP.NET docs](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/dotnet/guides/aspnet/).

### Samples

You can find an example ASP.NET MVC 5 app with Sentry integrated [on this GitHub repository.](https://github.com/getsentry/examples/tree/master/dotnet/AspNetMvc5Ef6)

See the following examples that demonstrate how to integrate Sentry with various frameworks.

- [Multiple samples in the `dotnet` SDK repository](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/tree/main/samples) (**C#**)
- [Basic F# sample](https://github.com/sentry-demos/fsharp) (**F#**)
