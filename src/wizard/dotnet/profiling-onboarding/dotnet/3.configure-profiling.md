#### Configure Profiling

Add the `ProfilesSampleRate` option to your SDK config.

```csharp
SentrySdk.Init(options =>
{
    // A Sentry Data Source Name (DSN) is required.
    // See https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-basics/dsn-explainer/
    // You can set it in the SENTRY_DSN environment variable, or you can set it in code here.
    options.Dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___";

    // We recommend adjusting this value in production:
    options.TracesSampleRate = 1.0;

    // The sampling rate for profiling is relative to TracesSampleRate.
    // Setting to 1.0 will profile 100% of sampled transactions.
    // We recommend adjusting this value in production:
    options.ProfilesSampleRate = 1.0;

    // Windows, Linux and macOS profiling requires NuGet package: Sentry.Profiling
    // Note: by default, the profiler is initialized asynchronously, this can be tuned by passing an desired initialization timeout to the constructor.
    options.AddIntegration(new ProfilingIntegration());
});
```
