#### Configure Performance

Sentryâ€™s performance monitoring product has to be enabled in order for Profiling to work. To enable performance monitoring in the SDK:

```csharp
using Sentry;

SentrySdk.Init(options =>
{
    // A Sentry Data Source Name (DSN) is required.
    // See https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-basics/dsn-explainer/
    // You can set it in the SENTRY_DSN environment variable, or you can set it in code here.
    options.Dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___";

    // When debug is enabled, the Sentry client will emit detailed debugging information to the console.
    // This might be helpful, or might interfere with the normal operation of your application.
    // We enable it here for demonstration purposes when first trying Sentry.
    // You shouldn't do this in your applications unless you're troubleshooting issues with Sentry.
    options.Debug = true;

    // This option is recommended. It enables Sentry's "Release Health" feature.
    options.AutoSessionTracking = true;

    // Enabling this option is recommended for client applications only. It ensures all threads use the same global scope.
    options.IsGlobalModeEnabled = false;

    // This option will enable Sentry's tracing features. You still need to start transactions and spans.
    options.EnableTracing = true;

    // We recommend adjusting this value in production:
    options.TracesSampleRate = 1.0;
});
```
