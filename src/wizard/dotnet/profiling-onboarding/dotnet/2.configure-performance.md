#### Configure Performance

Sentryâ€™s performance monitoring product has to be enabled in order for Profiling to work. To enable performance monitoring in the SDK:

```csharp
SentrySdk.Init(options =>
{
    // A Sentry Data Source Name (DSN) is required.
    // See https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-basics/dsn-explainer/
    // You can set it in the SENTRY_DSN environment variable, or you can set it in code here.
    options.Dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___";

    // We recommend adjusting this value in production:
    options.TracesSampleRate = 1.0;
});
```
