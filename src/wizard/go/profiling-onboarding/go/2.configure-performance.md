#### Configure Performance

Sentryâ€™s performance monitoring product has to be enabled in order for Profiling to work. To enable performance monitoring in the SDK:

```go
err := sentry.Init(sentry.ClientOptions{
	Dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
	EnableTracing: true,
	// We recommend adjusting this value in production:
	TracesSampleRate: 1.0,
})
```
