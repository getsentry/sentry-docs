Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your application’s runtime.

> If you are using Expo, see [How to Add Sentry to Your Expo Project](https://docs.expo.io/guides/using-sentry/). This SDK works for both managed and bare projects.


Run `@sentry/wizard`:

```bash
yarn sentry-wizard -s -i reactNative
```

[Sentry Wizard](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-wizard) will patch your project accordingly, though you can [setup manually](/platforms/react-native/manual-setup/manual-setup/) if you prefer.

- iOS Specifics: When you use Xcode, you can hook directly into the build process to upload debug symbols and source maps. However, if you are using bitcode, you will need to disable the “Upload Debug Symbols to Sentry” build phase and then separately upload debug symbols from iTunes Connect to Sentry.
- Android Specifics: We hook into Gradle for the source map build process. When you run `./gradlew assembleRelease`, source maps are automatically built and uploaded to Sentry. If you have enabled Gradle's `org.gradle.configureondemand` feature, you'll need a clean build, or you'll need to disable this feature to upload the source map on every build by setting `org.gradle.configureondemand=false` or remove it.

### Initialize the SDK

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react-native";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100% of transactions for performance monitoring.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production.
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

The `sentry-wizard` will try to add it to your `App.tsx`

### Wrap your app

Wrap your app with Sentry to automatically instrument it with [touch event tracking](/platforms/react-native/touchevents/) and [automatic performance monitoring](/platforms/react-native/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/):

```javascript
export default Sentry.wrap(App);
```

You do not need to do this for Sentry to work or if your app does not have a single parent "App" component.

### Verify

Then create an intentional error, so you can test that everything is working:

```javascript
throw new Error("My first Sentry error!");
```

Or, try a native crash with:

```javascript
Sentry.nativeCrash();
```
If you're new to Sentry, use the email alert to access your account and complete a product tour.

If you're an existing user and have disabled alerts, you won't receive this email.

## Performance

Sentry can measure the performance of your app automatically when instrumented with the following routers:

- [React Navigation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/react-native/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#react-navigation)
- [React Navigation V4 and prior](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/react-native/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#react-navigation-v4)
- [React Native Navigation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/react-native/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#react-native-navigation)

Additionally, you can create transactions and spans programatically:

For example:

```javascript
// Let's say this function is invoked when a user clicks on the checkout button of your shop
shopCheckout() {
  // This will create a new Transaction for you
  const transaction = Sentry.startTransaction({ name: "shopCheckout" });
  // Set transaction on scope to associate with errors and get included span instrumentation
  // If there's currently an unfinished transaction, it may be dropped
  Sentry.getCurrentHub().configureScope(scope => scope.setSpan(transaction));

  // Assume this function makes an xhr/fetch call
  const result = validateShoppingCartOnServer();

  const span = transaction.startChild({
    data: {
      result
    },
    op: 'task',
    description: `processing shopping cart result`,
  });
  try {
    processAndValidateShoppingCart(result);
    span.setStatus(SpanStatus.Ok);
  } catch (err) {
    span.setStatus(SpanStatus.UnknownError);
    throw err;
  } finally {
    span.finish();
    transaction.finish();
  }
}
```
