* where you can find them in the folder named "gettingStartedDocs" ->                               *

* This document is planned to be removed in the future. However, it has not been removed yet,       *
* primarily because self-hosted users depend on it to access instructions for setting up their      *
* platform. We need to come up with a solution before removing these docs.                          *

To manually instrument certain regions of your code, you can create a transaction to capture them.

```javascript
const transaction = Sentry.startTransaction({ name: "test-transaction" });
const span = transaction.startChild({ op: "functionX" }); // This function returns a Span
// functionCallX
span.finish(); // Remember that only finished spans will be sent with the transaction
transaction.finish(); // Finishing the transaction will send it to Sentry
```
