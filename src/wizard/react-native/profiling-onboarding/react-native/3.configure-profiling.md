#### Configure Profiling

Add the `profilesSampleRate` option to your SDK config.

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  _experiments: {
    // The sampling rate for profiling is relative to TracesSampleRate.
    // In this case, we'll capture profiles for 100% of transactions.
    profilesSampleRate: 1.0,
  },
});
```
