Install our SDK using the cordova command:

```bash
$ cordova plugin add sentry-cordova
```

You should `init` the SDK in the `deviceReady` function, to make sure the native integrations runs. For more details about Cordova [click here](/platforms/javascript/guides/cordova/)

```javascript
onDeviceReady: function() {
  var Sentry = cordova.require("sentry-cordova.Sentry");
  Sentry.init({ dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___' });
}
```

One way to verify your setup is by intentionally causing an error that breaks your application.

Calling an undefined function will throw an exception:

```js
myUndefinedFunction();
```
