#### Configure Performance

Sentryâ€™s performance monitoring product has to be enabled in order for Profiling to work. To enable performance monitoring in the SDK:

```rust
sentry::init((
    "___DSN___",
    sentry::ClientOptions {
        release: sentry::release_name!(),
        traces_sample_rate: 1.0,
        ..Default::default()
    },
));
```
