#### Configure Server-side Profiling

Add the `profilesSampleRate` option to the `sentry.server.config.js` config file and initialize the SDK integration:

```javascript {filename:sentry.server.config.js}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";
import { ProfilingIntegration } from "@sentry/profiling-node";

Sentry.init({
  // ... SDK config
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  profilesSampleRate: 1.0, // Profiling sample rate is relative to tracesSampleRate
  integrations: [
    // Add profiling integration to list of integrations
    new ProfilingIntegration(),
  ],
});
```

#### Configure Client-side Profiling

In order for the profiler to be allowed to profile your page, the document response header has to include a `Document-Policy` header key with the `js-profiling` value.

Add the `profilesSampleRate` option to `sentry.client.config.js`, add `Sentry.BrowserProfilingIntegration` to your integrations list and initialize the SDK.

```javascript {filename:sentry.client.config.js}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    // Add browser profiling integration to the list of integrations
    new Sentry.BrowserProfilingIntegration(),
  ],
  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for performance monitoring.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  // Set profilesSampleRate to 1.0 to profile every transaction.
  // Since profilesSampleRate is relative to tracesSampleRate,
  // the final profiling rate can be computed as tracesSampleRate * profilesSampleRate
  // For example, a tracesSampleRate of 0.5 and profilesSampleRate of 0.5 would
  // results in 25% of transactions being profiled (0.5*0.5=0.25)
  profilesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```
