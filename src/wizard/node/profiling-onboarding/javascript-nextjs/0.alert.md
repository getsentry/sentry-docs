<div class='alert warning'>
Profiling in Node is currently in Beta, and there may be some bugs. We recognize the irony. If you have any questions or feedback, join our <a href="https://discord.gg/zrMjKA4Vnz">discord channel</a>.

Note that only nextjs server side profiling is supported, client side (browser profiling) is not supported and you will need to make sure you only enable profiling in `sentry.server.config.js` file.
