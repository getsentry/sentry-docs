#### Configure Performance

Sentry’s performance monitoring product has to be enabled in order for Profiling to work. To enable performance monitoring in the SDK:

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/node";
import "@sentry/tracing";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for performance monitoring.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```
