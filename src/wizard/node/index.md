* This document is planned to be removed in the future. However, it has not been removed yet,       *
* primarily because self-hosted users depend on it to access instructions for setting up their      *
* platform. We need to come up with a solution before removing these docs.                          *

Add `@sentry/node` as a dependency:

```bash
# Using yarn
yarn add @sentry/node

# Using npm
npm install --save @sentry/node
```

You need to inform the Sentry Node SDK about your DSN:

```javascript
const Sentry = require("@sentry/node");
// or use es6 import statements
// import * as Sentry from '@sentry/node';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for performance monitoring.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

const transaction = Sentry.startTransaction({
  op: "test",
  name: "My First Test Transaction",
});

setTimeout(() => {
  try {
    foo();
  } catch (e) {
    Sentry.captureException(e);
  } finally {
    transaction.finish();
  }
}, 99);
```

The above configuration captures both error and performance data. To reduce the volume of performance data captured, change tracesSampleRate to a value between 0 and 1.
