#### Install

For the Profiling integration to work, you must have the Sentry Cocoa package (minimum version 7.23.0). We offer installation methods for Carthage (shown below), CocoaPods, and Swift Package Manager. Learn more about installation methods in our [full documentation](/platforms/apple/install/).

```ruby
github "getsentry/sentry-cocoa" "{{ packages.version('sentry.cocoa','7.23.0') }}"
```
