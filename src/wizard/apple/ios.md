We recommend installing the SDK with CocoaPods, but we also support alternate [installation methods](/platforms/apple/install/). To integrate Sentry into your Xcode project, specify it in your _Podfile_:

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
use_frameworks! # This is important

target 'YourApp' do
  pod 'Sentry', :git => 'https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa.git', :tag => '{{ packages.version('sentry.cocoa') }}'
end
```

Afterwards run `pod install`.

## Configuration

Make sure you initialize the SDK as soon as possible in your application lifecycle e.g. in your AppDelegate `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

// ....

func application(_ application: UIApplication,
    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {

    SentrySDK.start { options in
        options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
        options.debug = true // Enabled debug when first installing is always helpful

        // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100% of transactions for performance monitoring.
        // We recommend adjusting this value in production.
        options.tracesSampleRate = 1.0
    }

    return true
}
```

When using SwiftUI and your app doesn't implement an app delegate, initialize the SDK within the [App conformer's initializer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/app/main()):

```swift
import Sentry

@main
struct SwiftUIApp: App {
    init() {
        SentrySDK.start { options in
            options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
            options.debug = true // Enabled debug when first installing is always helpful

            // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100% of transactions for performance monitoring.
            // We recommend adjusting this value in production.
            options.tracesSampleRate = 1.0
        }
    }
}
```

## Debug Symbols

Before capturing crashes, you need to provide debug information to Sentry. Debug information is provided by uploading dSYM files using one of two methods, dependent on your setup:

- [With Bitcode](/platforms/apple/dsym/#dsym-with-bitcode)
- [Without Bitcode](/platforms/apple/dsym/#dsym-without-bitcode)

## Performance Monitoring

After [setting up performance monitoring](/platforms/apple/guides/ios/performance), the Cocoa SDK [automatically instruments](/platforms/apple/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/) UIViewControllers, HTTP requests, app start, and slow and frozen frames.

You can manually measure the performance of your code by capturing transactions and spans.

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry // Make sure you import Sentry

// Transaction can be started by providing, at minimum, the name and the operation
let transaction = SentrySDK.startTransaction(name: "Update Repos", operation: "db")
// Transactions can have child spans (and those spans can have child spans as well)
let span = transaction.startChild(operation: "db", description: "Update first repo")

// ...
// (Perform the operation represented by the span/transaction)
// ...

span.finish() // Mark the span as finished
transaction.finish() // Mark the transaction as finished and send it to Sentry
```

Check out [the documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/apple/performance/instrumentation/) to learn more about the API and automatic instrumentations.

> Want to play with some new features? Try out our experimental auto instrumentation for [file I/O](/platforms/apple/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#file-io-instrumentation) and [Core Data](/platforms/apple/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#core-data-instrumentation). Experimental features are still a work-in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.
