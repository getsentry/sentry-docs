## Install

Add Sentry automatically to your app with the [Sentry wizard](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/#install):

```bash
npx @sentry/wizard -i nextjs
```

## Configure

The Sentry wizard will automatically patch your application:

- create `sentry.client.config.js` and `sentry.server.config.js` with the default `Sentry.init`.
- create `next.config.js` with the default configuration.
- create `sentry.properties` with configuration for sentry-cli (which is used when automatically uploading source maps).

You can also [configure it manually](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/manual-setup/).

Configure the Sentry initialization:

Install Sentryâ€™s Next.js SDK using either `yarn` or `npm`:

```bash
yarn add @sentry/nextjs
# or
npm install --save @sentry/nextjs
```

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [new Sentry.BrowserTracing(), new Sentry.Replay()],

  // Performance Monitoring
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0, // Capture 100% of the transactions, reduce in production!
  // Set `tracePropagationTargets` to control for which URLs distributed tracing should be enabled
  tracePropagationTargets: ["localhost", /^https:\/\/yourserver\.io\/api/],

  // Session Replay
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1, // This sets the sample rate at 10%. You may want to change it to 100% while in development and then sample at a lower rate in production.
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0, // If you're not already sampling the entire session, change the sample rate to 100% when sampling sessions where errors occur.
});
```

## Verify

This snippet contains an intentional error and can be used as a test to make sure that everything's working as expected.

```javascript
return <button onClick={() => methodDoesNotExist()}>Break the world</button>;
```
