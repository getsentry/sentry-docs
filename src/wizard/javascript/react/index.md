In this quick guide you’ll set up `@sentry/react` for [error monitoring](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/react/) and [performance monitoring](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/react/performance/)

---

## Install

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your application’s runtime.

```bash
# Using yarn
yarn add @sentry/react

# Using npm
npm install --save @sentry/react
```

## Configure

Initialize Sentry as early as possible in your application's lifecycle.

```javascript
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import React from "react";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";
import App from "./App";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [new Sentry.BrowserTracing()],
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

const container = document.getElementById(“app”);
const root = createRoot(container);
root.render(<App />);
```

> **tracesSampleRate: 1.0**
> The above setting ensures that 100% of transactions will be sent to Sentry, but we recommend lowering this number in production.

## Verify

This snippet contains an intentional error and can be used as a test to make sure that everything's working as expected.

```javascript
return <button onClick={() => methodDoesNotExist()}>Break the world</button>;
```
