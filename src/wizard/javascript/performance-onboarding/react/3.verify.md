#### Verify

Verify that performance monitoring is working correctly with our [automatic instrumentation](/platforms/javascript/guides/react/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/) by simply using your React application.

You have the option to manually construct a transaction using [custom instrumentation](/platforms/javascript/guides/react/performance/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation/):

```javascript
const transaction = Sentry.startTransaction({ name: "test-transaction" });
const span = transaction.startChild({ op: "functionX" }); // This function returns a Span
// functionCallX
span.finish(); // Remember that only finished spans will be sent with the transaction
transaction.finish(); // Finishing the transaction will send it to Sentry
```

In addition, `@sentry/react` exports a `withProfiler` higher order component that can be used to capture React-related spans for specific React components:

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";

function App(props) {
  // ...
  return <div />;
}

export default Sentry.withProfiler(App);
```

Learn more about the profiler in [React Component Tracking](/platforms/javascript/guides/react/features/component-tracking/).
