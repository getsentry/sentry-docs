#### Verify

Verify that performance monitoring is working correctly with our [automatic instrumentation](/platforms/javascript/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/) by simply using your JavaScript application.

You have the option to manually construct a transaction using [custom instrumentation](/platforms/javascript/performance/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation/):

```javascript
const transaction = Sentry.startTransaction({name: 'test-transaction'});
const span = transaction.startChild({op: 'functionX'}); // This function returns a Span
// exampleFunctionCall();
span.finish(); // Remember that only finished spans will be sent with the transaction
transaction.finish(); // Finishing the transaction will send it to Sentry
```
