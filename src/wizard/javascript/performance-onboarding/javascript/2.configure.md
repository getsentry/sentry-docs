#### Configure

Configuration should happen as early as possible in your application's lifecycle.

Once this is done, Sentry's JavaScript SDK captures all unhandled exceptions and transactions.

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";
import { BrowserTracing } from "@sentry/tracing";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [new BrowserTracing()],

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for performance monitoring.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

We recommend adjusting the value of `tracesSampleRate` in production. Learn more about configuring sampling in our [full documentation](/platforms/javascript/configuration/sampling/).

Learn more about manually capturing an error or message in our [Usage documentation](/usage/).

To view and resolve the recorded error, log into [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and open your project. Clicking on the error's title will open a page where you can see detailed information and mark it as resolved.
