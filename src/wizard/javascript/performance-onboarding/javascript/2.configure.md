#### Configure

Configuration should happen as early as possible in your application's lifecycle.

Once this is done, Sentry's JavaScript SDK captures all unhandled exceptions and transactions.

```javascript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/browser';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
  integrations: [new Sentry.BrowserTracing()],

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for performance monitoring.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

We recommend adjusting the value of `tracesSampleRate` in production. Learn more about configuring sampling in our [full documentation](/platforms/javascript/configuration/sampling/).
