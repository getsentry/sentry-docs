#### Configure

There are several privacy and sampling options available, all of which can be set using the `integrations` constructor. Learn more about configuring Session Replay by reading the [configuration docs](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/session-replay/). Add the following to your SDK config:

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/capacitor";
import { Replay } from "@sentry/replay";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // This sets the sample rate at 10%. You may want this to be 100% while
  // in development, then sample at a lower rate in production.
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
  // If the entire session is not sampled, use the below sample rate to sample
  // sessions when an error occurs.
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,

  integrations: [new Replay()],
});
```
