#### Configure

Add the following to your SDK config. Several privacy and sampling options are available, all of which can be set using the `integrations` constructor. Learn more about configuring Session Replay by reading the [configuration docs](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/session-replay/).

Alert: The Replay integration _must_ be added to your _`sentry.client.config.js`_ file. Adding it into `sentry.server.config.js` or `sentry.edge.config.js` may break your build.

```javascript {filename:sentry.client.config.js}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // This sets the sample rate to be 10%. You may want this to be 100% while
  // in development and sample at a lower rate in production
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
  // If the entire session is not sampled, use the below sample rate to sample
  // sessions when an error occurs.
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,

  integrations: [new Sentry.Replay()],
});
```
