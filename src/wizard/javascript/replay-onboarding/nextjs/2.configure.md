#### Configure

Add the following to your Client SDK config. There are several privacy and sampling options available, all of which can be set via the `integrations` constructor. Learn more about configuring Session Replay in our Github [Readme](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-replay/blob/main/README.md).

```javascript {filename:sentry.client.config.js}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";
import { Replay } from "@sentry/replay";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "https://examplePublicKey@o0.ingest.sentry.io/0",
  integrations: [
    new Replay({
      // Capture 10% of all sessions
      sessionSampleRate: 0.1,

      // Of the remaining 90% of sessions, if an error happens start capturing
      errorSampleRate: 1.0,
    })
  ],
});
```

Note: The `@sentry/replay` integration only needs to be added to your `sentry.client.config.js` file. It will not run if it is added into `sentry.server.config.js`.
