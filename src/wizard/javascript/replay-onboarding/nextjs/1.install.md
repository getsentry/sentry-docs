#### Install

For the sentry-replay integration to work, you must have the Sentry browser SDK package (minimum version 7.x), or an equivalent framework SDK (e.g. @sentry/react) installed.

```bash
# Using yarn
yarn add @sentry/nextjs @sentry/replay

# Using npm
npm install --save @sentry/nextjs @sentry/replay
```
