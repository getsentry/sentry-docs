#### Configure

Add the following to your SDK config. There are several privacy and sampling options available, all of which can be set via the `integrations` constructor. Learn more about configuring Session Replay by reading the [configuration docs](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/vue/session-replay/custom-instrumentation/).

#### Vue 2

```javascript
import Vue from "vue";
import Router from "vue-router";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/vue";
import { Replay } from "@sentry/replay";

Vue.use(Router);

const router = new Router({
  // ...
});

Sentry.init({
  Vue,
  dsn: "https://examplePublicKey@o0.ingest.sentry.io/0",

  // This sets the sample rate to be 10%. You may want this to be 100% while
  // in development and sample at a lower rate in production
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
  // If the entire session is not sampled, use the below sample rate to sample
  // sessions when an error occurs.
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,

  integrations: [
    new Replay()
  ],
});

// ...

new Vue({
  router,
  render: h => h(App),
}).$mount("#app");
```

#### Vue 3

```javascript
import { createApp } from "vue";
import { createRouter } from "vue-router";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/vue";
import { Replay } from "@sentry/replay";

const app = createApp({
  // ...
});
const router = createRouter({
  // ...
});

Sentry.init({
  app,
  dsn: "https://examplePublicKey@o0.ingest.sentry.io/0",

  // This sets the sample rate to be 10%. You may want this to be 100% while
  // in development and sample at a lower rate in production
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
  // If the entire session is not sampled, use the below sample rate to sample
  // sessions when an error occurs.
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,

  integrations: [
    new Replay()
  ],
});

app.use(router);
app.mount("#app");
```
