#### Configure

Add the following to your SDK config. There are several privacy and sampling options available, all of which can be set using the `integrations` constructor. Learn more about configuring Session Replay by reading the [configuration docs](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/gatsby/session-replay/).

Register the `@sentry/gatsby` plugin in your Gatsby configuration file (typically `gatsby-config.js`).

```javascript {filename:gatsby-config.js}
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: "@sentry/gatsby",
    },
  ],
};
```

Configure your `Sentry.init`:

```javascript {filename:sentry.config.js}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/gatsby";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // This sets the sample rate to be 10%. You may want this to be 100% while
  // in development and sample at a lower rate in production
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
  // If the entire session is not sampled, use the below sample rate to sample
  // sessions when an error occurs.
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,

  integrations: [new Sentry.Replay()],
});
```

Note: If `gatsby-config.js` has any settings for the `@sentry/gatsby` plugin they need to be moved into `sentry.config.js`. The `gatsby-config.js` file doesn't support non-serializable options, like `new Replay()`.
