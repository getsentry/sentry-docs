#### Configure

Add the following to your SDK config. There are several privacy and sampling options available, all of which can be set via the `integrations` constructor. Learn more about configuring Session Replay in our Github [Readme](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-replay/blob/main/README.md).

Include the `@sentry/gatsby` plugin:

```javascript {filename:gatsby-config.js}
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: "@sentry/gatsby",
    },
  ]
};
```

Configure your `Sentry.init`:

```javascript {filename:sentry.config.js}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/gatsby";
import { Replay } from "@sentry/replay";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "https://examplePublicKey@o0.ingest.sentry.io/0",
  integrations: [
    new Replay({
      // Capture 10% of all sessions
      sessionSampleRate: 0.1,

      // Of the remaining 90% of sessions, if an error happens start capturing
      errorSampleRate: 1.0,
    })
  ],
});
```

Note: If `gatsby-config.js` has any settings for the `@sentry/gatsby` plugin they need to be moved into `sentry.config.js`. The `gatsby-config.js` file doesn't support non-serializable options, like `new Replay()`.
