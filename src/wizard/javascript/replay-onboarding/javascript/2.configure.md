#### Configure

Add the following to your SDK config. There are several privacy and performance options available, all of which can be set via the `integrations` constructor. Learn more about configuring Replay in our Github [Readme](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-replay/blob/main/README.md).

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";
import { Replay } from "@sentry/replay";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "‚Äùhttps://examplePublicKey@o0.ingest.sentry.io/0",
  integrations: [
    new Replay({
      replaysSamplingRate: 0.1, // 10% Sample Rate
    })
  ],
})
```
