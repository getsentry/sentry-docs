#### Configure

Add the following to your SDK config in `hooks.client.(js|ts)`. There are several privacy and sampling options available, all of which can be set using the `integrations` constructor. Learn more about configuring Session Replay by reading the [configuration docs](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/svelte/session-replay/).

```javascript
// hooks.client.(js|ts):
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/sveltekit';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',

  // Session Replay
  integrations: [new Sentry.Replay()],

  // This sets the sample rate at 10%. You may want to change it to 100% while in development
  // and then sample at a lower rate in production:
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
  // If you're not already sampling the entire session, change the sample rate to 100% when
  // sampling sessions where errors occur:
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```
