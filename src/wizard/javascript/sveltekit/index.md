Configure your app automatically with the [Sentry wizard](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/sveltekit/#install).

```bash
npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i sveltekit
```

Sentry wizard will automatically patch your application:

- Create or update `src/hooks.client.js` and `src/hooks.server.js` with the default `Sentry.init` call and Sentry's hooks handlers.
- Update `vite.config.js` to add source maps upload and auto-instrumentation via Vite plugins.
- create `.sentryclirc` and `sentry.properties` files with configuration for sentry-cli (which is used when automatically uploading source maps).

You can also [configure the Sentry SDK manually](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/sveltekit/manual-setup/).

Configure the Sentry SDK:

To configure the Sentry SDK, edit the `Sentry.init` options in `hooks.(client|server).(js|ts)`:

```javascript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/sveltekit';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
  integrations: [new Sentry.BrowserTracing()],
  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for performance monitoring.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

The above configuration captures both error and performance data. We recommend adjusting `tracesSampleRate` in production, see [Sampling](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/sampling/).

After this step, Sentry will report any uncaught exceptions triggered by your application.

You can trigger your first event from your development environment by raising an exception somewhere within your application. An example of this would be rendering a button whose `on:click` handler attempts to invoke a function that doesn't exist:

```html
<!-- +page.svelte -->
<button type="button" on:click="{unknownFunction}">Break the world</button>
```

Once you've verified the SDK is initialized properly and you've sent a test event, check out our [complete SvelteKit docs](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/sveltekit/) for additional configuration instructions.
