## Install

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your applicationâ€™s runtime.

```bash
# Using ember-cli
ember install @sentry/ember
```

## Configure

You should `init` the Sentry SDK as soon as possible during your application load up in `app.js`, before initializing Ember:

```javascript
import Application from "@ember/application";
import Resolver from "ember-resolver";
import loadInitializers from "ember-load-initializers";
import config from "./config/environment";

import * as Sentry from "@sentry/ember";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // Performance Monitoring
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0, // Capture 100% of the transactions, reduce in production!
});

export default class App extends Application {
  modulePrefix = config.modulePrefix;
  podModulePrefix = config.podModulePrefix;
  Resolver = Resolver;
}
```

## Verify

This snippet contains an intentional error and can be used as a test to make sure that everything's working as expected.

```javascript
myUndefinedFunction();
```
