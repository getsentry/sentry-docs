## Instrument your application

To begin collecting error and performance data from your Vue application, you'll need the following packages:

* `@sentry/browser` (Sentry's core browser SDK)
* `@sentry/integrations` (contains Sentry's Vue integration)
* `@sentry/tracing` (instruments performance data)

Below are instructions for using your favorite package manager, or alternatively loaded directly from our CDN.

### Using yarn or npm

Install the dependencies:

```bash
# Using yarn
$ yarn add @sentry/browser @sentry/integrations @sentry/tracing

# Using npm
$ npm install @sentry/browser @sentry/integrations @sentry/tracing
```

Next, initialize Sentry in your app entry point before you initialize your root component. 

```javascript
import Vue from "vue";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";
import { Vue as VueIntegration } from "@sentry/integrations";
import { Integrations } from '@sentry/tracing';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    new VueIntegration({
      Vue,
      tracing: true
    }),
    new Integrations.BrowserTracing()
  ],
  tracesSampleRate: 1
});
```

### Using our CDN

Alternatively, you can load these packages directly from our CDN using two script tags:

```html
<script
  src="https://browser.sentry-cdn.com/{{ packages.version('sentry.javascript.browser') }}/bundle.tracing.min.js"
  integrity="sha384-{{ packages.checksum('sentry.javascript.browser', 'bundle.tracing.min.js', 'sha384-base64') }}"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
></script>
<script
  src="https://browser.sentry-cdn.com/{{ packages.version('sentry.javascript.browser') }}/vue.min.js"
  integrity="sha384-{{ packages.checksum('sentry.javascript.browser', 'vue.min.js', 'sha384-base64') }}"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
></script>
```

If you load the Sentry packages this way, they are available under the `Sentry` namespace on the global scope.

Next, initialize Sentry in your `app.js`:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    new Sentry.Integrations.Vue({
      Vue,
      tracing: true
    }),
    new Sentry.Integrations.BrowserTracing()
  ],
  tracesSampleRate: 1
});
```

After this, Sentry will automatically catch and report any uncaught exceptions, and report on the performance of your application.

### Additional Options

Additionally, `Integrations.Vue` accepts a few different configuration options that let you change its behavior:

- Passing in `Vue` is optional, if you do not pass it `window.Vue` must be present.
- Passing in `attachProps` is optional and is `true` if it is not provided. If you set it to `false`, Sentry will suppress sending all Vue components' props for logging.
- Passing in `logErrors` is optional and is `false` if it is not provided. If you set it to `true`, Sentry will call original Vue's `logError` function as well.

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"><h5 class="no_toc">Vue Error Handling</h5><div class="alert-body content-flush-bottom">
Please note that if you enable this integration, Vue will not call its `logError` internally. This means that errors occurring in the Vue renderer will not show up in the developer console.
If you want to preserve this functionality, make sure to pass the `logErrors: true` option.
