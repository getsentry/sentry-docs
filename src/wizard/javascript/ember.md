To use Sentry with your Ember application, you will need to use Sentryâ€™s Ember addon: `@sentry/ember`.

```bash
# Using ember-cli
ember install @sentry/ember
```

You should `init` the Sentry SDK as soon as possible during your application load up in `app.js`, before initializing Ember:

```javascript
import Application from "@ember/application";
import Resolver from "ember-resolver";
import loadInitializers from "ember-load-initializers";
import config from "./config/environment";

import { InitSentryForEmber } from "@sentry/ember";

InitSentryForEmber();

export default class App extends Application {
  modulePrefix = config.modulePrefix;
  podModulePrefix = config.podModulePrefix;
  Resolver = Resolver;
}
```

Then add the following config to your `config/environment.js`:

```javascript
ENV["@sentry/ember"] = {
  sentry: {
    dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  },
};
```

We recommend adjusting the value of `tracesSampleRate` in production. Learn more about configuring sampling in our [full documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/performance/sampling/).
