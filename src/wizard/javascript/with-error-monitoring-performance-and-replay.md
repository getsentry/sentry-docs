## Install

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your application’s runtime.

```bash
# Using yarn
yarn add @sentry/browser
# Using npm
npm install --save @sentry/browser
```

## Configure

Initialize Sentry as early as possible in your application's lifecycle.

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [new Sentry.BrowserTracing(), new Sentry.Replay()],
  // Performance Monitoring
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0, // Capture 100% of the transactions, reduce in production!
  // Session Replay
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1, // This sets the sample rate at 10%. You may want to change it to 100% while in development and then sample at a lower rate in production.
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0, // If you're not already sampling the entire session, change the sample rate to 100% when sampling sessions where errors occur.
});
```

## Verify

This snippet contains an intentional error and can be used as a test to make sure that everything's working as expected.

```javascript
myUndefinedFunction();
```
