## Install
Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your applicationâ€™s runtime.

```bash
# Using yarn
yarn add @sentry/browser @sentry/integrations

# Using npm
npm install --save @sentry/browser @sentry/integrations
```

## Configure
Initialize Sentry as early as possible in your application's lifecycle.

```javascript
import angular from "angular";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";
import { Angular as AngularIntegration } from "@sentry/integrations";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    new AngularIntegration(),
      tracePropagationTargets: ["localhost", "https://yourserver.io/api"],
    }),
  ],
});

// Finally require ngSentry as a dependency in your application module.
angular.module("yourApplicationModule", ["ngSentry"]);
```

## Verify
This snippet contains an intentional error and can be used as a test to make sure that everything's working as expected.
