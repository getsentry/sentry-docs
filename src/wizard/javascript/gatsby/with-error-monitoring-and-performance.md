## Install

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your applicationâ€™s runtime.

```bash
# Using yarn
yarn add @sentry/gatsby

# Using npm
npm install --save @sentry/gatsby
```

## Configure

Register the `@sentry/gatsby` plugin in your Gatsby configuration file (typically `gatsby-config.js`).

```javascript {filename:gatsby-config.js}
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: '@sentry/gatsby',
    },
  ],
};
```

Then, configure your `Sentry.init`:

```javascript {filename:sentry.config.js}
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/gatsby';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
  integrations: [new Sentry.BrowserTracing()],
  // Performance Monitoring
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0, // Capture 100% of the transactions, reduce in production!
});
```

## Verify
