<Alert level="info">
    Sentry for Java is a collection of modules provided by Sentry; it supports Java 1.8 and above. At its core, Sentry for Java provides a raw client for sending events to Sentry.

</Alert>

## Install

Install the SDK via Gradle, Maven, or SBT:

```groovy {filename:build.gradle}
// Make sure jcenter or mavenCentral is there.
repositories {
    jcenter()
    // Or
    mavenCentral()
}

// Add Sentry's SDK as a dependency.
dependencies {
    implementation 'io.sentry:sentry:4.0.0'
}
```

```xml {tabTitle:Maven}{filename:pom.xml}
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.sentry</groupId>
    <artifactId>sentry</artifactId>
    <version>4.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

```scala {tabTitle:SBT}
libraryDependencies += "io.sentry" % "sentry" % "4.0.0"
```

## Configure

Configure Sentry as soon as possible in your application's lifecycle:

```java {tabTitle: Java}
import io.sentry.Sentry;

Sentry.init(options -> {
  options.setDsn("___PUBLIC_DSN___");
});
```

```kotlin {tabTitle: Kotlin}
import io.sentry.Sentry

Sentry.init {
  it.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
}
```

### Send First Event

Trigger your first event from your development environment by intentionally creating an error with the `Sentry#captureException` method, to test that everything is working:


```java {tabTitle: Java}
import java.lang.Exception;
import io.sentry.Sentry;

try {
    throw new Exception("This is a test.");
} catch (Exception e) {
    Sentry.captureException(e);
}
```

```kotlin {tabTitle: Kotlin}
import java.lang.Exception
import io.sentry.Sentry

try {
    throw Exception("This is a test.")
} catch (e: Exception) {
    Sentry.captureException(e)
}
```

To view and resolve the error, log in to <a href="https://sentry.io/">sentry.io</a> then open your project. Click the error's title to open a page with detailed information and mark it as resolved.
