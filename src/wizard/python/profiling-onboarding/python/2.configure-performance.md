#### Configure Performance

Sentryâ€™s performance monitoring product has to be enabled in order for Profiling to work. To enable performance monitoring in the SDK:

```python
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
  dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  # Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  # of transactions for performance monitoring.
  # We recommend adjusting this value in production
  traces_sample_rate=1.0,
);
```
