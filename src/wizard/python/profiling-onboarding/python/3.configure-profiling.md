#### Configure Profiling

Add the `profiles_sample_rate` option to your SDK config.

```python
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    # ... SDK config

    # To set a uniform sample rate
    # Set profiles_sample_rate to 1.0 to profile 100%
    # of sampled transactions.
    # We recommend adjusting this value in production
    profiles_sample_rate=1.0,

    # Alternatively, to control sampling dynamically
    profiles_sampler=profiles_sampler
)
```
