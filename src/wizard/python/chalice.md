* We've successfully migrated all "getting started/wizard" documents to the main Sentry repository, *
* where you can find them in the folder named "gettingStartedDocs" ->                               *

* This document is planned to be removed in the future. However, it has not been removed yet,       *
* primarily because self-hosted users depend on it to access instructions for setting up their      *
* platform. We need to come up with a solution before removing these docs.                          *
