#### Configure Performance

Sentryâ€™s performance monitoring product has to be enabled in order for Profiling to work.

```php
\Sentry\init([
    'dsn' => '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
    'traces_sample_rate' => 1.0,
);
```

In order to capture profiling data, you need to start a transaction.

Check out the <a href="https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/php/performance/">performance setup</a> and <a href="https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/php/performance/instrumentation/">instrumentation</a> docs for more detailed information.
