#### Install

For the Profiling integration to work, you must have the Sentry Android package (minimum version 6.0.0). You can choose between automatic and manual installation methods, using Sentryâ€™s Android Gradle Plugin (shown below). Learn more about installation methods in our [full documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/android/#install).

```groovy
buildscript {
  repositories {
    mavenCentral()
  }
}
plugins {
  id "io.sentry.android.gradle" version "{{@inject packages.version('sentry.java.android.gradle-plugin', '3.0.0') }}"
}
```
