title: Using Sentry with CodePush
tags: []
---
If you want to use Sentry together with CodePush you will have to pass `release` and `dist` to `Sentry.init`. Our suggestion is to store them in an `app.json`, or you can just use the `package.json`. These values need to be unique to each version of your codebase and match the version on the source maps exactly, or they might not be symbolicated.

We recommend using the format `${BUNDLE_ID}@${APP_VERSION}+codepush:${DIST}` for release names.

```javascript
import { release, dist } from 'app.json'

Sentry.init({
  // ...
  release,
  dist
});
```

If you need to use `codePush.getUpdateMetadata`, you will have to wait to initialize the Sentry SDK until the Promise is resolved.

This method is not recommended as any errors or crashes that happen before the initialization of the Sentry SDK will not be caught.

```javascript
import codePush from "react-native-code-push";

codePush.getUpdateMetadata().then((update) => {
  if (update) {
    Sentry.init({
      // ...
      release: `${update.appVersion}+codepush:${update.label}`
    });
  }
});
```

## Making Releases

After updating your CodePush release, you have to upload the new assets to Sentry:

When making the release with CodePush, make sure to output the bundle and source maps by specifying `--sourcemap-output` and `--output-dir ./build`. This will output to the `./build/CodePush ` folder.

```bash
$ appcenter codepush release-react -a {APP} -d {DEPLOYMENT} --sourcemap-output --output-dir ./build
```

Exporting the `SENTRY_PROPERTIES` will tell sentry-cli to use the properties in your project. The sentry-wizard install step should have generated this file for you. Alternatively, you can either pass it via parameters or a global settings file. To find more about this refer to [Working with Projects](/cli/configuration/#sentry-cli-working-with-projects).

```bash
$ export SENTRY_PROPERTIES=./ios/sentry.properties
```

Upload the outputted bundle and source maps to Sentry.
If you use custom deployment names in CodePush, you will need to use `--deployment` to specify the deployment.

```bash
$ sentry-cli react-native appcenter {APP} ios ./build/CodePush --deployment {DEPLOYMENT} --dist {DIST}
```

If you still have issues with CodePush source maps, you can refer to [Source Maps for Other Platforms](/platforms/react-native/sourcemaps/) to manually bundle and upload source maps to Sentry.
