To use Sentry with your Ember application, you will need to use Sentryâ€™s browser JavaScript SDK: `@sentry/browser`.

On its own, `@sentry/browser` will report any uncaught exceptions triggered from your application.
In order to use ESM imports without any additional configuration, you can use `ember-auto-import`
by installing it with `ember install ember-auto-import`.

Starting with version `5.x` our `Ember` integration lives in it's own package `@sentry/integrations`.
You can install it with `npm` / `yarn` like:

```bash
# Using yarn
yarn add @sentry/integrations

# Using npm
npm install @sentry/integrations
```

Then add this to your `app.js`:

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";
import { Ember as EmberIntegration } from "@sentry/integrations";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [new EmberIntegration()],
});
```

In case you are using the CDN version or the Loader, we provide a standalone file for every integration, you can use it
like this:

```html
<!-- Note that we now also provide a es6 build only -->
<!-- <script src="https://browser.sentry-cdn.com/5.20.1/bundle.es6.min.js" integrity="sha384-vX2xdItiRzNmed/VJFb8J4h2p35hYqkdTI9+xNOueKEcr7iipZy17fplNS0ikHL0" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> -->
<script
  src="https://browser.sentry-cdn.com/5.20.1/bundle.min.js"
  integrity="sha384-O8HdAJg1h8RARFowXd2J/r5fIWuinSBtjhwQoPesfVILeXzGpJxvyY/77OaPPXUo"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
></script>

<!-- If you include the integration it will be available under Sentry.Integrations.Ember -->
<script
  src="https://browser.sentry-cdn.com/5.20.1/ember.min.js"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
></script>

<script>
  Sentry.init({
    dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    integrations: [new Sentry.Integrations.Ember()],
  });
</script>
```
