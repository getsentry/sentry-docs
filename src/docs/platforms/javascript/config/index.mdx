Sentry's JavaScript SDK includes many configuration options that are automatically set. You can configure your SDK using the options outlined in these pages:

- **[Basic Options](basics/)**

  Learn more about how to configure the JavaScript SDK. These options are set when the SDK is first initialized, passed to the `init()` as an object. This page also discusses the Hooks `beforeSend` and `beforeBreadcrumb` as well as transport options.

- **[Filter Events Reported to Sentry](filter/)**

  Learn more about how to filter events reported to Sentry, using either the SDK, product filtering options, or both.

- **[Lazy Loading](lazy-load-sentry/)**

  We recommend using our bundled CDN version for the browser. However, if you useÂ `defer`, learn more about its effect on capturing errors.

- **[Shutdown and Draining](shutdown-drain/)**

  Learn more about the default behavior of our JavaScript SDK if the application shuts down unexpectedly.

- **[Source Maps](sourcemaps/)**

  Learn more about the Sentry JavaScript SDK's automatic fetching of source code and source maps by scraping the URLs within the stack trace.

- **[Supported Browsers](supported-browsers/)**

  We support a variety of browsers; check out our list.
