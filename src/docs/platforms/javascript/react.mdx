To use Sentry with your React application, you will need to use `@sentry/react` (Sentry’s Browser React SDK).

<Alert level="info" title="Note"><markdown>

`@sentry/react` is a wrapper around the `@sentry/browser` package, with added functionality related to React. All methods available in the `@sentry/browser` package can also be imported from `@sentry/react`.

</markdown></Alert>


Add the Sentry SDK as a dependency using yarn or npm:

```bash
# Using yarn
$ yarn add @sentry/react

# Using npm
$ npm install @sentry/react
```

## Connecting the SDK to Sentry

After you've completed setting up a project in Sentry, Sentry will give you a value which we call a _DSN_ or _Data Source Name_. It looks a lot like a standard URL, but it’s just a representation of the configuration required by the Sentry SDKs. It consists of a few pieces, including the protocol, public key, the server address, and the project identifier.

You should `init` the Sentry browser SDK as soon as possible during your application load up, before initializing React:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react';
import App from './App';

Sentry.init({dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___"});

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

On its own, `@sentry/react` will report any uncaught exceptions triggered by your application.

You can trigger your first event from your development environment by raising an exception somewhere within your application. An example of this would be rendering a button:

```jsx
return <button onClick={methodDoesNotExist}>Break the world</button>;
```


## Error Boundaries

If you're using React 16 or above, Error Boundaries are an essential tool for defining your application's behavior in the face of errors. The `@sentry/react` package exposes an error boundary component that automatically sends JavaScript errors from inside a React component tree to Sentry.

<Alert level="warning" title="Note"><markdown>

In development mode, React will rethrow errors caught within an error boundary. This will result in errors being reported twice to Sentry with the above setup, but this won’t occur in your production build.

</markdown></Alert>


In the example below, when the `<Example />` component hits an error, the `<Sentry.ErrorBoundary>` component will send data about that error and the component tree to Sentry, open a user feedback dialog, and render a fallback UI.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react';

import {Example} from '../example';

function FallbackComponent() {
  return (
    <div>An error has occurred</div>
  )
}

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Sentry.ErrorBoundary fallback={FallbackComponent} showDialog>
        <Example />
      </Sentry.ErrorBoundary>
    )
  }
}

export default App;
```

### ErrorBoundary Options

The ErrorBoundary component exposes a variety of props that can be passed in for extra configuration. There are no required options, but we highly recommend that you set a fallback component.

#### `showDialog` (boolean)

If a [Sentry User Feedback Widget](/enriching-error-data/user-feedback/?platform=) should be rendered when the Error Boundary catches an error.

#### `dialogOptions` (Object)

Options that are passed into the Sentry User Feedback Widget. See all possible customization options [here](/enriching-error-data/user-feedback/?platform=#customizing-the-widget)

#### `fallback` (React.ReactNode or Function)

A fallback component that gets rendered when the error boundary encounters an error. You can can either provide a React Component, or a function that returns a React Component as a valid fallback prop. If you provide a function, Sentry will call the function with the error and the component stack at the time of the error.

#### `onError` (Function)

A function that gets called when the Error Boundary encounters an error. `onError` is useful if you want to propagate the error into a state management library like Redux, or if you want to check any side effects that could have occurred due to the error.

#### `onMount` (Function)

A function that gets called on ErrorBoundary `componentDidMount()`

#### `onUnmount` (Function)

A function that gets called on ErrorBoundary `componentWillUnmount()`

### ErrorBoundary Usage

#### Setting a Fallback Function (Render Props)

Below is an example where a fallback prop, using the [render props approach](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html), is used to display a fallback UI on error, and gracefully return to a standard component state when reset.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react';

class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      message: "This is my app",
    };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <Sentry.ErrorBoundary fallback={({ error, componentStack, resetError }) => (
          <React.Fragment>
            <div>You have encountered an error</div>
            <div>{error.toString()}</div>
            <div>{componentStack}</div>
            <button
              onClick={() => {
                this.setState({ message: "This is my app" });
                resetError();
              }}
            >
              Click here to reset!
            </button>
          </React.Fragment>
        )}>
        <div>{this.state.message}</div>
        {/* on click, this button sets an Object as a message, not a string. */}
        {/* which will cause an error to occur in the component tree */}
        <button onClick={() => this.setState({ message: {text: "Hello World"} })}>Click here to change message!</button>
      </Sentry.ErrorBoundary>
    )
  }
}

export default App;
```

## Redux

*(New in version 5.20.0)*

Redux support is included in the `@sentry/react` package since version `5.20.0`. To apply Sentry to Redux, use `Sentry.createReduxEnhancer` at the same place that you initialize your Redux store.


```js
import { createStore, compose } from 'redux';
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react'

// ...

const sentryReduxEnhancer = Sentry.createReduxEnhancer({
  // Optionally pass options listed below
});

const store = createStore(rootReducer, sentryReduxEnhancer);

// ...

```

If you have other enhancers or middleware such as `thunk`:

```js
const store = createStore(rootReducer, compose(applyMiddleware(thunk), sentryReduxEnhancer));
```

<Alert level="info" title="Note"><markdown>

Sentry uses a redux **enhancer**. Pass the enhancer, as indicated above. Don't pass it to `applyMiddleware` and don't call the method when you pass it to the `createStore` method.

</markdown></Alert>


### Normalization Depth

By default Sentry SDKs normalize any context to a depth of 3, which in the case of sending Redux state you probably will want to increase that. You do so by passing `normalizeDepth` to the `Sentry.init` call:

```js
Sentry.init({
  dsn: '___DSN___',
  normalizeDepth: 10 // Or however deep you want your state context to be.
})
```

### Redux Enhancer Options

Pass an options object as the first parameter to `Sentry.createReduxEnhancer` to configure it.

<Alert level="warning" title="Note"><markdown>

We advise against sending sensitive information to Sentry, but if you do, we will try our best to filter out things such as user passwords.

</markdown></Alert>


#### `actionTransformer` (Function)

Used to remove sensitive information from actions. The first parameter passed to the function is the Redux action. Return `null` to not send the action to Sentry. By default we send all actions.

```js
const sentryReduxEnhancer = Sentry.createReduxEnhancer({
  actionTransformer: action => {
    if (action.type === "GOVERNMENT_SECRETS") {
      // Return null to not log the action to Sentry
      return null;
    }
    if (action.type === "SET_PASSWORD" ) {
      // Return a transformed action to remove sensitive information
      return {
        ...action,
        password: null
      }
    };

    return action;
  }
});
```

#### `stateTransformer` (Function)

Used to remove sensitive information from state.  The first parameter passed to the function is the Redux state. Return `null` to not attach the state to events sent to Sentry. Note that if you choose not to send state to Sentry, your errors might not have the latest version of the state attached. By default, we attach all state changes.

```js
const sentryReduxEnhancer = Sentry.createReduxEnhancer({
  stateTransformer: state => {
    if (state.topSecret.doNotSend) {
      // Return null to not send this version of the state.
      return null;
    }

    // Transform the state to remove sensitive information
    const transformedState = {
      ...state,
      topSecret: {
        ...state.topSecret,
        // Replace sensitive information with something else
        nuclearLaunchCodes: "I love pizza",
        // or just remove it entirely
        hiddenTreasureLocation: null
      },
      // You should also remove large data that is irrelevant to debugging to not clutter your Sentry issues
      giganticState: null
    };

    return transformedState;
  }
})
```

### `configureScopeWithState` (Function)

Called on every state update, configure the Sentry Scope with the Redux state. The first parameter is the scope, which is the same scope instance that you would get when you call `Sentry.configureScope`, and the second parameter is the latest Redux state.

```js
const sentryReduxEnhancer = Sentry.createReduxEnhancer({
  configureScopeWithState: (scope, state) => {
    // Set tag if the user is using imperial units.
    if (state.settings.useImperialUnits) {
      scope.setTag('user.usesImperialUnits', true);
    }
  }
});
```
