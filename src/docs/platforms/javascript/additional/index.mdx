## Sentry Testkit

When building tests for your application, you want to assert, that the right flow-tracking or error is being sent to Sentry, but without really sending it to the Sentry servers. This way you won't swamp Sentry with false reports during test runs or other CI operations.

Note: [Wix](https://wix.github.io/sentry-testkit/), a Sentry partner, maintains Sentry Testkit.

[Sentry Testkit](https://wix.github.io/sentry-testkit/) is a Sentry plugin that allows intercepting Sentry's reports and further inspection of the data being sent. It enables Sentry to work natively in your application, and by overriding the default Sentry's transport mechanism, the report is not really sent, but rather logged locally into the memory. This way, logged reports can be fetched later for your own usage, verification, or any other use you may have in your local developing/testing environment.

## Installation

```
npm install sentry-testkit --save-dev
```

### Using in tests

```javascript
const sentryTestkit = require("sentry-testkit");

const { testkit, sentryTransport } = sentryTestkit();

// initialize your Sentry instance with sentryTransport
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  transport: sentryTransport,
  //... other configurations
});

// then run any scenario that should call Sentry.catchException(...)

expect(testkit.reports()).toHaveLength(1);
const report = testkit.reports()[0];
expect(report).toHaveProperty(/*...*/);
```

You may see more usage examples in the [testing section](https://github.com/wix/sentry-testkit/tree/master/test) of sentry-testkit repository as well.

### Testkit API

Sentry Testkit consists of a very simple and straightforward API.
See the full API description and documentation in [Sentry Testkit Docs](https://wix.github.io/sentry-testkit/).


## Using a Client directly

To be able to manage several Sentry instances without any conflicts between them you need to create your own `Client`.
This also helps to prevent tracking of any parent application errors in case your application is integrated
inside of it. In this example we use `@sentry/browser` but it's also applicable to `@sentry/node`.

```javascript
import { BrowserClient } from "@sentry/browser";

const client = new BrowserClient({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
});

client.captureException(new Error("example"));
```

While the above sample should work perfectly fine, some methods like `configureScope` and `withScope` are missing on the `Client` because the `Hub` takes care of the state management. That's why it may be easier to create a new `Hub` and bind your `Client` to it. The result is the same but you will also get state management with it.

```javascript
import { BrowserClient, Hub } from "@sentry/browser";

const client = new BrowserClient({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
});

const hub = new Hub(client);

hub.configureScope(function(scope) {
  scope.setTag("a", "b");
});

hub.addBreadcrumb({ message: "crumb 1" });
hub.captureMessage("test");

try {
  a = b;
} catch (e) {
  hub.captureException(e);
}

hub.withScope(function(scope) {
  hub.addBreadcrumb({ message: "crumb 2" });
  hub.captureMessage("test2");
});
```

### Dealing with integrations

Integrations are setup on the `Client`, if you need to deal with multiple clients and hubs you have to make sure to also do the integration handling correctly.
Here is a working example of how to use multiple clients with multiple hubs running global integrations.

```js
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";

// Very happy integration that'll prepend and append very happy stick figure to the message
class HappyIntegration {
  constructor() {
    this.name = "HappyIntegration";
  }

  setupOnce() {
    Sentry.addGlobalEventProcessor(event => {
      const self = Sentry.getCurrentHub().getIntegration(HappyIntegration);
      // Run the integration ONLY when it was installed on the current Hub
      if (self) {
        event.message = `\\o/ ${event.message} \\o/`;
      }
      return event;
    });
  }
}

HappyIntegration.id = "HappyIntegration";

const client1 = new Sentry.BrowserClient({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [...Sentry.defaultIntegrations, new HappyIntegration()],
  beforeSend(event) {
    console.log("client 1", event);
    return null; // Returning null does not send the event
  },
});
const hub1 = new Sentry.Hub(client1);

const client2 = new Sentry.BrowserClient({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___", // Can be a different DSN
  integrations: [...Sentry.defaultIntegrations, new HappyIntegration()],
  beforeSend(event) {
    console.log("client 2", event);
    return null; // Returning null does not send the event
  },
});
const hub2 = new Sentry.Hub(client2);

hub1.run(currentHub => {
  // The hub.run method makes sure that Sentry.getCurrentHub() returns this hub during the callback
  currentHub.captureMessage("a");
  currentHub.configureScope(function(scope) {
    scope.setTag("a", "b");
  });
});

hub2.run(currentHub => {
  // The hub.run method makes sure that Sentry.getCurrentHub() returns this hub during the callback
  currentHub.captureMessage("x");
  currentHub.configureScope(function(scope) {
    scope.setTag("c", "d");
  });
});
```
