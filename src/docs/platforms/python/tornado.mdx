_(New in version : 0.6.3)_

The Tornado integration adds support for the [Tornado Web
Framework](https://www.tornadoweb.org/). A Tornado version of 5 or greater and
Python 3.6 or greater is required.

1. Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI:

   ```bash
   $ pip install --upgrade sentry-sdk==0.16.2
   ```

2. If you're on Python 3.6, you also need the `aiocontextvars` package:

   ```bash
   $ pip install --upgrade aiocontextvars
   ```

3. Initialize the SDK before starting the server:

   ```python
   import sentry_sdk
   from sentry_sdk.integrations.tornado import TornadoIntegration

   sentry_sdk.init(
       dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
       integrations=[TornadoIntegration()]
   )

   # Your app code here, without changes

   class MyHandler(...):
       ...
   ```

## Behavior

- The Tornado integration will be installed for all of your apps and handlers.

- All exceptions leading to a Internal Server Error are reported.

- Request data is attached to all events: **HTTP method, URL, headers, form data, JSON payloads**. Sentry excludes raw bodies and multipart file uploads. Sentry also excludes personally identifiable information (such as user ids, usernames, cookies, authorization headers, IP addresses) unless you set `send_default_pii` to `True`.

Each request has a separate scope. Changes to the scope within a view, for example setting a tag, will only apply to events sent as part of the request being handled.

- Logging with any logger will create breadcrumbs when
  the [Logging](/platforms/python/logging/)
  integration is enabled (done by default).
