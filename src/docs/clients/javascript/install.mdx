Raven is distributed in a few different methods, and should get included after any other libraries are included, but before your own scripts.

So for example:

```html
<script src="jquery.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.ravenjs.com/3.26.4/raven.min.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script>Raven.config('___PUBLIC_DSN___').install();</script>
<script src="app.js"></script>
```

This allows the ability for Raven’s integrations to instrument themselves. If included before something like Angular, it’d be impossible to use for example, the Angular plugin.

## Using our CDN

We serve our own builds off of [Fastly](http://www.fastly.com/). They are accessible over both http and https, so we recommend leaving the protocol off.

Our CDN distributes builds with and without [_integrations_](/clients/javascript/integrations/).

```html
<script src="https://cdn.ravenjs.com/3.26.4/raven.min.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

This version does not include any plugins. See [ravenjs.com](http://ravenjs.com/) for more information about plugins and getting other builds.

## Bower

We also provide a way to deploy Raven via [bower](http://bower.io/). Useful if you want serve your own scripts instead of depending on our CDN and mantain a `bower.json` with a list of dependencies and versions (adding the `--save` flag would automatically add it to `bower.json`).

```sh
$ bower install raven-js --save
```

```html
<script src="/bower_components/raven-js/dist/raven.js"></script>
```

Also note that the file is uncompressed but is ready to pass to any decent JavaScript compressor like [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2).

## npm

Raven is also available as an npm package, [raven-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/raven-js).

```sh
$ npm install raven-js --save
```

```html
<script src="/node_modules/raven-js/dist/raven.js"></script>
```

If you intend to use Raven with Node, [raven-node](https://github.com/getsentry/raven-node) is the client to use.

## CommonJS

To use Raven with CommonJS imports:

```javascript
var Raven = require('raven-js')     ;
Raven
    .config('___PUBLIC_DSN___')
    .install();
```

## ES2015 (ES6)

To use Raven with ES2015 (ES6) imports:

```javascript
import Raven from 'raven-js';
Raven
    .config('___PUBLIC_DSN___')
    .install();
```

## Async Loading

To load Sentry JS SDK asynchronously, you need to do two things.

Provide global `SENTRY_SDK` variable with SDK’s URL (for example from our CDN), your DSN and SDK’s configuration. And place the snippet below as soon as possible in your HTML code. For example:

```html
<script>
  window.SENTRY_SDK = {
    url: 'https://cdn.ravenjs.com/3.26.4/raven.min.js',
    dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
    options: {
      release: '1.3.0'
    }
  }

  ;(function(a,b,g,e,h){var k=a.SENTRY_SDK,f=function(a){f.data.push(a)};f.data=[];var l=a[e];a[e]=function(c,b,e,d,h){f({e:[].slice.call(arguments)});l&&l.apply(a,arguments)};var m=a[h];a[h]=function(c){f({p:c.reason});m&&m.apply(a,arguments)};var n=b.getElementsByTagName(g)[0];b=b.createElement(g);b.src=k.url;b.crossorigin="anonymous";b.addEventListener("load",function(){try{a[e]=l;a[h]=m;var c=f.data,b=a.Raven;b.config(k.dsn,k.options).install();var g=a[e];if(c.length)for(var d=0;d<c.length;d++)c[d].e?g.apply(b.TraceKit,c[d].e):c[d].p&&b.captureException(c[d].p)}catch(p){console.log(p)}});n.parentNode.insertBefore(b,n)})(window,document,"script","onerror","onunhandledrejection");
</script>
```

Or you can place those two things in a separate script tags. This will queue all errors (and promises if the environment supports `unhandledrejection` handler) that happened before SDK was loaded and send them once it’s configured and installed.

Be aware however, that there are some trade-offs to this solution, as errors might provide less information due to them being “retriggered” instead of being caught from the original source.

<Alert level="warning" title="Note"><markdown>

This won’t work when opening `index.html` or any other html file from the file system, as it doesn’t support anonymous cross-origin scripts. The same thing can happen for any cross-origin scripts as well. To read more about it, see [What the heck is Script error?](https://blog.sentry.io/2016/05/17/what-is-script-error).

## Requirements

Raven supports IE8+ and all other modern browsers, and works in Web Workers.

Raven requires the browser JavaScript environment to provide:

-   Either [XHR Level 2](http://caniuse.com/#feat=xhr2) (IE10+, all other modern browsers) or [XDomainRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XDomainRequest) (IE8, IE9)
-   A global `JSON` object with `JSON.stringify` (IE8+ [standards mode](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc288325(VS.85).aspx), all other modern browsers)

Raven does not support IE 7 or other older browsers which do not provide the required features listed above. On those older browsers, Raven.js is designed to fail gracefully; including it on your page will have no effect, but it won’t collect and report uncaught exceptions.
