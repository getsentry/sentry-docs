<Alert level="warning" title="Note">

This SDK has been superseded by the new React Native SDK. Sentry preserves this documentation for customers using the old client. We recommend using the [updated React Native SDK](/platforms/react-native/) for new projects.

</Alert>

In order to use Sentry with CocoaPods you have to install the packages with `npm` or `yarn` and link them locally in your `Podfile`.

```bash
npm install --save react react-native react-native-sentry
yarn add react react-native react-native-sentry
```

After that change your `Podfile` to reference to the packages in your `node_modules` folder. For the latest reference on how to use React Native with CocoaPods see: [Integration with existing apps](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/integration-with-existing-apps.html#configuring-cocoapods-dependencies)

```ruby
target 'YOUR-TARGET' do
  # Your react-native and other pods

  pod 'SentryReactNative', :path => '../node_modules/react-native-sentry/SentryReactNative.podspec' # or your path to node_modules
end
```

After that run `pod install` which then should link everything correctly. Please keep in mind that you need the build steps that upload your source maps and debug symbols.
