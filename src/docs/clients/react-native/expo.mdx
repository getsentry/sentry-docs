This SDK has been superseded by the new React Native SDK. Sentry preserves this documentation for customers using the old client. We recommend using the [updated React Native SDK](/platforms/react-native/) for new projects.

[Expo](https://expo.io/) is an excellent way to quickly create and play around with your React Native app. Now you can also use Sentry together with Expo:

```bash
$ npm i sentry-expo --save
```

In your `main.js` or `app.js`:

```javascript
import Sentry from "sentry-expo";
// import { SentrySeverity, SentryLog } from 'react-native-sentry';
Sentry.config("___PUBLIC_DSN___").install();
```

Make sure to use your public DSN instead of the private one.

For uploading source maps you have to add this to your `exp.json` or `app.json`

```javascript
{
  // ... your existing exp.json configuration is here

  "hooks": {
    "postPublish": [
      {
        "file": "sentry-expo/upload-sourcemaps",
        "config": {
          "organization": "your team short name here",
          "project": "your project short name here",
          "authToken": "your auth token here"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
  // ...
}
```

Note that `sentry-expo` only catches JavaScript exceptions (as opposed to native crashes). For more details, take a look at the [Expo documentation about native errors](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/guides/errors/#what-about-native-errors) and [this discussion](https://github.com/expo/sentry-expo/issues/87) in the `sentry-expo` repo.

If you need more help, check out [Expoâ€™s documentation about using Sentry](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/guides/using-sentry/).
