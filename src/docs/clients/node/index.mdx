<Alert level="warning" title="Note"><markdown>

A new Node SDK has superseded this deprecated version. Sentry preserves this documentation for customers using the old client. We recommend using the [updated Node SDK](/platforms/node/) for new projects.

</markdown></Alert>

raven-node is the official Node.js client for Sentry.

<Alert level="warning" title="Note"><markdown>

If you’re using JavaScript in the browser, you’ll need [raven-js](/clients/javascript).

<!-- WIZARD installation -->

## Installation

Raven is distributed via `npm`:

```bash
$ npm install raven --save
```

<!-- WIZARD configuration -->

## Configuring the Client

Next you need to initialize the Raven client and configure it to use your Sentry DSN:

```javascript
var Raven = require("raven");
Raven.config("___PUBLIC_DSN___").install();
```

At this point, Raven is set up to capture and report any uncaught exceptions.

You can optionally pass an object of configuration options as the 2nd argument to _Raven.config_. For more information, see [_Configuration_](/clients/node/config/).

<!-- WIZARD reporting-errors -->

## Reporting Errors

Raven’s `install` method sets up a global handler to automatically capture any uncaught exceptions. You can also report errors manually with `try...catch` and a call to `captureException`:

```javascript
try {
  doSomething(a[0]);
} catch (e) {
  Raven.captureException(e);
}
```

You can also use `wrap` and `context` to have Raven wrap a function and automatically capture any exceptions it throws:

```javascript
Raven.context(function() {
  doSomething(a[0]);
});
```

For more information on reporting errors, see [_Usage_](/clients/node/usage/).

## Adding Context

Code run via `wrap` or `context` has an associated set of context data, and Raven provides methods for managing that data.

You’ll most commonly use this to associate the current user with an exception:

```javascript
Raven.context(function() {
  Raven.setContext({
    user: {
      email: "matt@example.com",
      id: "123",
    },
  });
  // errors thrown here will be associated with matt
});
// errors thrown here will not be associated with matt
```

This can also be used to set `tags` and `extra` keys for associated tags and extra data.

You can update the context data with `mergeContext` or retrieve it with `getContext`. When an exception is captured by a wrapper, the current context state will be passed as options to `captureException`.

See [context/wrap](/clients/node/usage/#raven-node-additional-context) for more.

## Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs are records of server and application lifecycle events that can be helpful in understanding the state of the application leading up to a crash.

We can capture breadcrumbs and associate them with a context, and then send them along with any errors captured from that context:

```javascript
Raven.context(function() {
  Raven.captureBreadcrumb({
    message: "Received payment confirmation",
    category: "payment",
    data: {
      amount: 312,
    },
  });
  // errors thrown here will have breadcrumb attached
});
```

Raven can be configured to automatically capture breadcrubs for certain events including:

> - http/https requests
> - console log statements
> - postgres queries

For more information, see [Recording Breadcrumbs](/clients/node/usage/#raven-recording-breadcrumbs).

## Dealing with Minified Source Code

Raven and Sentry support [Source Maps](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/). If you provide source maps in addition to your minified files that data becomes available in Sentry. For more information see [Source Maps](/clients/node/sourcemaps/#raven-node-sourcemaps).

## Middleware and Integrations

If you’re using Node.js with a web server framework/library like Connect, Express, or Koa, it is recommended to configure one of Raven’s server middleware integrations. See [_Integrations_](/clients/node/integrations/).
