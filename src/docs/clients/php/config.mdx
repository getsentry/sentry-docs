Several options exist that allow you to configure the behavior of the `Raven_Client`. These are passed as the second parameter of the constructor, and is expected to be an array of key value pairs:

```php
$client = new Raven_Client($dsn, array(
    'option_name' => 'value',
));
```

## Available Settings

The following settings are available for the client:

`name`

: A string to override the default value for the server’s hostname.

  Defaults to `Raven_Compat::gethostname()`.

`tags`

: An array of tags to apply to events in this context.

  ```php
  'tags' => array(
      'php_version' => phpversion(),
  )
  ```

  ```php
  $client->tags_context(array(
      'php_version' => phpversion(),
  ));
  ```

`release`

: The version of your application (e.g. git SHA)

  ```php
  'release' => MyApp::getReleaseVersion(),
  ```

  ```php
  $client->setRelease(MyApp::getReleaseVersion());
  ```

`environment`

: The environment your application is running in.

  ```php
  'environment' => 'production',
  ```

  ```php
  $client->setEnvironment('production');
  ```

`app_path`

: The root path to your application code.

  ```php
  'app_path' => app_root(),
  ```

  ```php
  $client->setAppPath(app_root());
  ```

`excluded_app_paths`

: Paths to exclude from app_path detection.

  ```php
  'excluded_app_paths' => array(app_root() . '/cache'),
  ```

  ```php
  $client->setExcludedAppPaths(array(app_root() . '/cache'));
  ```

`prefixes`

: Prefixes which should be stripped from filenames to create relative paths.

  ```php
  'prefixes' => array(
      '/www/php/lib',
  ),
  ```

  ```php
  $client->setPrefixes(array(
      '/www/php/lib',
  ));
  ```

`sample_rate`

: The sampling factor to apply to events. A value of 0.00 will deny sending any events, and a value of 1.00 will send 100% of events.

  ```php
  // send 50% of events
  'sample_rate' => 0.5,
  ```

`send_callback`

: A function which will be called whenever data is ready to be sent. Within the function you can mutate the data, or alternatively return `false` to instruct the SDK to not send the event.

  ```php
  'send_callback' => function(&$data) {
      // strip HTTP data
      @unset($data['request']);
  },
  ```

  ```php
  $client->setSendCallback(function($data) {
      // don't send events if POST
      if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST')
      {
          return false;
      }
  });
  ```

`curl_method`

: Defaults to ‘sync’.

  Available methods:

  -   `sync` (default): send requests immediately when they’re made
  -   `async`: uses a curl_multi handler for best-effort asynchronous submissions
  -   `exec`: asynchronously send events by forking a curl process for each item

`curl_path`

: Defaults to ‘curl’.

  Specify the path to the curl binary to be used with the ‘exec’ curl method.

`transport`

: Set a custom transport to override how Sentry events are sent upstream.

  ```php
  'transport' => function($client, $data) {
      $myHttpClient->send(array(
          'url'     => $client->getServerEndpoint(),
          'method'  => 'POST',
          'headers' => array(
              'Content-Encoding' => 'gzip',
              'Content-Type'     => 'application/octet-stream',
              'User-Agent'       => $client->getUserAgent(),
              'X-Sentry-Auth'    => $client->getAuthHeader(),
          ),
          'body'    => gzcompress(jsonEncode($data)),
      ))
  },
  ```

  ```php
  $client->setTransport(...);
  ```

`trace`

: Set this to `false` to disable reflection tracing (function calling arguments) in stack traces.

`logger`

: Adjust the default logger name for messages.

  Defaults to `php`.

`ca_cert`

: The path to the CA certificate bundle.

  Defaults to the common bundle which includes getsentry.com: ./data/cacert.pem

  Caveats:

  -   The CA bundle is ignored unless curl throws an error suggesting it needs a cert.
  -   The option is only currently used within the synchronous curl transport.

`curl_ssl_version`

: The SSL version (2 or 3) to use. By default PHP will try to determine this itself, although in some cases this must be set manually.

`message_limit`

: Defaults to 1024 characters.

  This value is used to truncate message and frame variables. However it is not guarantee that length of whole message will be restricted by this value.

`processors`

: An array of classes to use to process data before it is sent to Sentry. By default, `Raven_Processor_SanitizeDataProcessor` is used

`processorOptions`

: Options that will be passed on to a `setProcessorOptions()` function in a `Raven_Processor` sub-class before that Processor is added to the list of processors used by `Raven_Client`

  An example of overriding the regular expressions in `Raven_Processor_SanitizeDataProcessor` is below:

  ```php
  'processorOptions' => array(
      'Raven_Processor_SanitizeDataProcessor' => array(
                  'fields_re' => '/(user_password|user_token|user_secret)/i',
                  'values_re' => '/^(?:\d[ -]*?){15,16}$/'
              )
  )
  ```

`timeout`

: The timeout for sending requests to the Sentry server in seconds, default is 2 seconds.

  ```php
  'timeout' => 2,
  ```

`excluded_exceptions`

: Exception that should not be reported, exceptions extending exceptions in this list will also be excluded, default is an empty array.

  In the example below, when you exclude `LogicException` you will also exclude `BadFunctionCallException` since it extends `LogicException`.

  ```php
  'excluded_exceptions' => array('LogicException'),
  ```

`ignore_server_port`

: By default the server port will be added to the logged URL when it is a non standard port (80, 443). Setting this to `true` will ignore the server port altogether and will result in the server port never getting appended to the logged URL.

  ```php
  'ignore_server_port' => true,
  ```

## Providing Request Context {#sentry-php-request-context}

Most of the time you’re not actually calling out to Raven directly, but you still want to provide some additional context. This lifecycle generally constists of something like the following:

-   Set some context via a middleware (e.g. the logged in user)
-   Send all given context with any events during the request lifecycle
-   Cleanup context

There are three primary methods for providing request context:

```php
// bind the logged in user
$client->user_context(array('email' => 'foo@example.com'));

// tag the request with something interesting
$client->tags_context(array('interesting' => 'yes'));

// provide a bit of additional context
$client->extra_context(array('happiness' => 'very'));
```

If you’re performing additional requests during the lifecycle, you’ll also need to ensure you cleanup the context (to reset its state):

```php
$client->context->clear();
```
