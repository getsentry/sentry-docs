Raven Ruby contains several “processors”, which scrub data before it is sent to Sentry. Processors remove invalid or sensitive data. The following are the processors which are enabled by default (and are applied to all outgoing data in this order):

RemoveCircularReferences

: Many Ruby JSON implementations simply throw an exception if they detect a circular reference. This processor removes circular references from hashes and arrays.

UTF8Conversion

: Many Ruby JSON implementations will throw exceptions if data is not in a consistent UTF-8 format. This processor looks for invalid encodings and fixes them.

SanitizeData

: Censors any data which looks like a password, social security number or credit card number. Can be configured to scrub other data.

Cookies

: Removes any HTTP cookies from the Sentry event data.

PostData

: Removes any HTTP Post request bodies.

HTTPHeaders

: Removes all HTTP headers which match a regex. By default, this will only remove the “Authorization” header, but can be configured to remove others.

Finally, another processor is included in the source but is not turned on by default, RemoveStackTrace.

To remove stack traces from events:

```ruby
Raven.configure do |config|
  config.processors += [Raven::Processor::RemoveStacktrace]
end
```

## Writing Your Own Processor

Processors are simple to write and understand. As an example, let’s say that we send user API keys to a background job (using Sidekiq), and if the background job raises an exception, we want to make sure that the API key is removed from the event data.

This is what a basic processor might look like:

```ruby
class MyJobProcessor < Raven::Processor
  def process(data)
    return data unless data["extra"]["arguments"] &&
      data["extra"]["arguments"].first["sensitive_parameter"]

    data["extra"]["arguments"].first["sensitive_parameter"] = STRING_MASK
    data
  end
end
```

Processors should inherit from the `Raven::Processor` class. This ensures that the processor has access to its client (all processors have a `client` instance method, which will be populated with the current `Raven::Client` when the processor is initialized), and gives you a few convenient constants for masking data.

Processors must have a method called `process` defined. It must accept one argument, which will be the Raven event data hash. The method must return a hash, which represents the data after it has been modified by the processor.

To help you in writing your own processor, here is what the Event data hash looks like (slightly modified/concatenated) when it is passed to the processor:

```ruby
{
  "environment" => "default",
  "event_id" => "02ea6d3d35c840b1a8f339ba896917e3",
  "extra" => {
    "server" => {
      # server related information
    },
    "active_job" => "MyActiveJob",
    "arguments" => [ {"sensitive_parameter": "sensitive"} ],
    "job_id" => "cbc2c146-0486-4e98-b81c-1a251d636b34",
  },
  "modules" => {
    "rake"=>"12.0.0",
    "concurrent-ruby"=>"1.0.5",
    "i18n"=>"0.8.6",
    "minitest"=>"5.10.3",
    # ...
  },
  "platform" => "ruby",
  "release" => "e4d5ced",
  "sdk" => {"name"=>"raven-ruby", "version"=>"2.6.3"},
  "server_name" => "myserver.local",
  "timestamp" => "2017-10-09T19:53:20",
  "exception" => {
    # A very large and complex exception object
  }
}
```

However, it will probably be more helpful if you use a debugger, such as _pry_, to inspect the event data hash for yourself.

The example processor given above looks for the ActiveJob arguments hash, looks for a particular value, and then replaces it with the string mask. There is a fast return if the event does not contain the ActiveJob data we’re looking for, using Ruby 2.3+’s safe navigation operator.

Once you have your processor written, you simply need to add it to the processor chain:

```ruby
Raven.configure do |config|
  config.processors += [MyJobProcessor]
end
```
