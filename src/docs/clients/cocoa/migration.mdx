## Upgrade from 2.x.x to 3.x.x {#upgrade-from-2-x-x-to-3-0-x}

### CocoaPods

Update your `Podfile` to include `:subspecs => ['Core', 'KSCrash']`:

  ```ruby
  source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
  platform :ios, '8.0'
  use_frameworks!

  target 'YourApp' do
      pod 'Sentry', :git => 'https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa.git', :subspecs => ['Core', 'KSCrash'], :tag => '3.x.x'
  end
  ```

### Carthage

Remove `KSCrash`, as it is now bundled in the Sentry SDK.

  ```ruby
  github "getsentry/sentry-cocoa" "3"
  ```

### Public API

Please check out our public API [Advanced Usage](/clients/cocoa/advanced/#advanced) for more examples.

## Upgrade from 3.x.x to 4.x.x {#upgrade-from-3-x-x-to-4-x-x}

- We removed the external `KSCrash` dependency and migrated the code directly into our SDK.
  There shouldn't be any conflicts including `KSCrash`, as it's no longer necessary.
