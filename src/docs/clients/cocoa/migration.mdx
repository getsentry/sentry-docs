<Alert level="warning" title="Note">

A new Cocoa SDK has superseded this deprecated version. Sentry preserves this documentation for customers using the old client. We recommend using the [updated Cocoa SDK](/platforms/apple/) for new projects.

</Alert>

## Upgrade from 2.x.x to 3.x.x {#upgrade-from-2-x-x-to-3-0-x}

### CocoaPods

Update your `Podfile` to include `:subspecs => ['Core', 'KSCrash']`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!

target 'YourApp' do
  pod 'Sentry', :git => 'https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa.git', :subspecs => ['Core', 'KSCrash'], :tag => '3.x.x'
end
```

### Carthage

Remove `KSCrash`, as it is now bundled in the Sentry SDK.

```ruby
github "getsentry/sentry-cocoa" "3"
```

### Public API

Please check out our public API [Advanced Usage](/clients/cocoa/advanced/) for more examples.

## Upgrade from 3.x.x to 4.x.x {#upgrade-from-3-x-x-to-4-x-x}

- We removed the external `KSCrash` dependency and migrated the code directly into our SDK.
  There shouldn't be any conflicts including `KSCrash`, as it's no longer necessary.
