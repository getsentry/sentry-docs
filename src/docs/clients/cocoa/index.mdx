<Alert level="warning" title="Note">

A new Cocoa SDK has superseded this deprecated version. Sentry preserves this documentation for customers using the old client. We recommend using the [updated Cocoa SDK](/platforms/apple/) for new projects.

</Alert>

This is the documentation for our official clients for Cocoa (Swift and Objective-C). Starting with version `3.0.0` we’ve switched our internal code from Swift to Objective-C to maximize compatibility. Also we trimmed the public API of our SDK to a minimum. Check out [Migration Guide](/clients/cocoa/migration/) or [Advanced Usage](/clients/cocoa/advanced/) for details.

## Getting Started

Getting started with Sentry is a three step process:

1.  [Sign up for an account](https://sentry.io/signup/)
2.  [Install your SDK](#install)
3.  [Configure it](#configure)

## Installation {#install}

The SDK can be installed using [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org), [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), or [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/). This is the recommended client for both Swift and Objective-C.

We recommend installing Sentry with CocoaPods.

### CocoaPods

To integrate Sentry into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your _Podfile_:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'
use_frameworks!

target 'YourApp' do
  pod 'Sentry', :git => 'https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa.git', :tag => '4.5.0'
end
```

Afterwards run `pod install`. In case you encounter problems with dependencies and you are on a newer CocoaPods you might have to run `pod repo update` first.

### Carthage

To integrate Sentry into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your _Cartfile_:

```ruby
github "getsentry/sentry-cocoa" "4.5.0"
```

Run `carthage update` to download the framework and drag the built _Sentry.framework_ into your Xcode project.

We also provide a pre-built version for every release which can be downloaded at [releases on GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/releases).

### Swift Package Manager

Starting with sentry-cocoa version `4.4.3`, we support Swift Package Manager.

To integrate Sentry into your Xcode project using SPM, open your App in Xcode and open File -> Swift Packages -> Add Package Dependency. Then add sentry-cocoa by entering the git repo url `https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa.git`, and select a version (or branch) on the next page.

NOTE: Version tags or branches need to have the Package.swift file in it or Xcode won't be able to install the package. Thus versions previous to `4.4.3` can't be installed via SPM!

## Configuration {#configure}

To use the client, change your AppDelegate’s _application_ method to instantiate the Sentry client:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

func application(_ application: UIApplication,
    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {

    // Create a Sentry client and start crash handler
    do {
        Client.shared = try Client(dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___")
        try Client.shared?.startCrashHandler()
    } catch let error {
        print("\(error)")
    }

    return true
}
```

If you prefer to use Objective-C you can do so like this:

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

NSError *error = nil;
SentryClient *client = [[SentryClient alloc] initWithDsn:@"___PUBLIC_DSN___" didFailWithError:&error];
SentryClient.sharedClient = client;
[SentryClient.sharedClient startCrashHandlerWithError:&error];
if (nil != error) {
    NSLog(@"%@", error);
}
```

## Debug Symbols {#sentry-cocoa-debug-symbols}

Before you can start capturing crashes you will need to tell Sentry about the debug information by uploading dSYM files. Depending on your setup this can be done in different ways:

- [With Bitcode](/clients/cocoa/dsym/#dsym-with-bitcode)
- [Without Bitcode](/clients/cocoa/dsym/#dsym-without-bitcode)

<!-- TODO-ADD-VERIFICATION-EXAMPLE -->

## Testing a Crash

If you would like to test the crash reporting you will need to cause a crash. While the seemingly obvious method would be to make it crash on launch, this will not give the Sentry client a chance to actually submit the crash report. Instead, we recommend triggering a crash from a button tap.

You can use the following methods to cause a crash:

- Swift:

  ```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
  Client.shared?.crash()
  ```

- Objective-C:

  ```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
  [SentryClient.sharedClient crash];
  ```

_If you crash with a debugger attached, nothing will happen._

Crashes are only submitted upon re-launching the application. To see the crash in Sentry, close the app and launch it again from the springboard.
