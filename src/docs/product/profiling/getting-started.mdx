<Note>

Profiling is currently in beta. Beta features are still in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony. If you have any questions or feedback, please email us at [profiling@sentry.io](mailto:profiling@sentry.io).

</Note>

To set up the profiling integration, use the links for supported SDKs below. Profiling helps you see code-level profiling information for your Sentry apps.

## Supported SDKs

<Alert>

Profiling depends on Sentry's performance monitoring product being enabled beforehand. To enable performance monitoring in the SDK, check out our [Performance Monitoring guide](/product/performance/getting-started/).
