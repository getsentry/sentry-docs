<Note>

The beta program for Profiling is now closed, but Profiling will become generally available soon. If you weren't part of the beta program, any Profiles sent during this time won't appear in your dashboard.

</Note>

To set up the profiling integration, use the links for supported SDKs below. Profiling helps you see code-level profiling information for your Sentry apps.

## Supported SDKs

<Alert>

Profiling depends on Sentry's performance monitoring product being enabled beforehand. To enable performance monitoring in the SDK, check out our [Performance Monitoring guide](/product/performance/getting-started/).
