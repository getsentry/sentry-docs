With Session Replay, Sentry users can get to the root of an error or performance issue faster, by watching a video-like reproduction of a user session and getting additional information such as what would appear in the developer tools of a client browser.

To get instructions for how to set it up and start sending replays, click a link for one of the supported SDKs below.
