With Session Replay, Sentry users can get to the root of an error or performance issue faster, by watching a video-like reproduction of a user session and getting additional information such as what would appear in the developer tools of a client browser.

To get instructions for how to set it up and start sending replays, click a link for one of the supported SDKs below.

## Supported SDKs

Session Replay supports all browser-based applications.
This includes static websites, single-page-aplications and also server-side-rendered, that includes frameworks such as:
[Django](/platforms/python/integrations/django/),
[Spring](/platforms/java/guides/spring-boot/),
[ASP.NET](/platforms/dotnet/guides/aspnetcore/),
[Laravel](/platforms/php/guides/laravel/),
[Express](/platforms/node/guides/express/) and
[Rails](/platforms/ruby/guides/rails/).
If you don't use `npm` or `yarn`, you can use [our Loader `script` tag](/platforms/javascript/install/loader/) on your main HTML template.

The Sentry SDK that records the replay runs on the client's browser, and itâ€™s built-in to `@sentry/browser` and our browser framework SDKs:
