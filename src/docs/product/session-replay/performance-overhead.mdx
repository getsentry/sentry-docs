Session Replay works by observing and recording changes to your web application's DOM, and transmitting that data to event ingestion servers over the public internet. In order to perform this work without negatively impacting the host page's performance, the Session Replay SDK takes care to introduce minimal additional filesize, observe and record DOM content in a non-intrusive way, send the absolute minimum number of bytes required, and use low-latency ingestion endpoints geographically close to your end-users.

**For most web applications, the performance overhead of our client SDK is imperceptible to end-users.**

Performance overhead depends on the complexity of your application. Applications with a large DOM and numerous DOM node mutations will have a higher overhead than a more simpler and mostly static site. The only way to get accurate overhead metrics is to measure it yourself. We have written a blog post, [Measuring Session Replay Overhead](https://sentry.engineering/blog/measuring-session-replay-overhead), that outlines how you can get started measuring overhead of Replay on your applications without deploying to production. We measured the overhead of the Replay SDK on Sentry's web UI using the methodology from the blog. Here are the results (median values are shown):

| metric                           | Without Sentry | Sentry SDK only | Sentry + Replay SDK |
| -------------------------------- | -------------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)\* | 1336.05 ms     | 1896.80 ms      | 1643.00 ms          |
| Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)    | 0.39 ms        | 0.39ms          | 0.39 ms             |
| First Input Delay (FID)          | 1.30 ms        | 1.30 ms         | 1.60 ms             |
| Total Blocking Time (TBT)        | 2629.00ms      | 2742.00 ms      | 3267.50 ms          |
| Average Memory                   | 118.79 MB      | 113.79 MB       | 132.05 MB           |
| Max Memory                       | 311.4 MB       | 316.57 MB       | 334.82 MB           |
| Network Upload                   | 21 B           | 3.79 KB         | 392.98 KB           |
| Network Download                 | 7.11 MB        | 6.93 MB         | 6.87 MB             |

  *: The standard deviation for LCP was 386, 511, 354 ms respectively, meaning
  that the LCP values are quite spread out and explains why the only-Sentry LCP
  value is higher than Sentry with Replay.

The benchmarks were run on an Apple M1 MacBook Pro against a remote preview server against a remote API backend with 100 iterations. The scenario can be summarized as loading Sentry, navigating to Discover, adding 4 columns, waiting for results, adding another column, and finally waiting for results a second time. The benchmark tests a rather strenuous recording scenario as the Discover data table is one of our most complex in regards to DOM nodes and mutations. A simpler scenario run consisting of navigation to four different "Settings" pages produced an increase of ~100 ms of total JS blocking time.

<Note>
  There is a known performance issue when recording replays with many DOM
  mutations. This generally occurs when rendering large data grids. We are
  currently working on improving the performance of this situation, but in the
  mean time it is recommended to [use the blocking
  feature](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/session-replay/privacy/#blocking)
  in order to not record these large mutations which can degrade performance for
  your customers.

## How is Session Replay optimized?

Sentry's Session Replay SDK takes several measures to avoid negatively impacting the performance of the page on which it's running:

- At the time of publishing this document, the Session Replay plugin is an additional ~36KB gzipped.
  - In our own research, this is among the smallest filesize Session Replay SDKs available.
  - We provide multiple ways to load the Replay bundle, including [via our Loader Script](/platforms/javascript/install/loader/).
- The Session Replay SDK works by snapshotting the web page’s Document Object Model (DOM) and transmitting its content to Sentry’s servers. To minimize the amount of bytes transferred, multiple strategies are employed:
  - Once the initial DOM tree is snapshotted, the SDK records and transmits _changes_ (deltas) to the DOM rather than snapshotting the entire tree again. This ensures the smallest amount of state is transmitted to facilitate playback. Additionally, the SDK does not spend CPU cycles scanning for changes itself; instead it listens for changes emitted by [`MutationObserver`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver), an internal browser API.
  - DOM content itself is gzip compressed client-side before transmission over HTTP. The compression operation is executed in a background thread using a [Web Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers), which means the browser’s UI thread is unaffected.
  - The SDK does not cause the browser to download and transmit other static assets, like images, video, etc. Instead during playback, those assets are fetched directly from the original host server.
- Sentry’s event ingestion infrastructure uses [distributed Points-of-Presence (PoPs)](https://blog.sentry.io/2022/03/31/sentry-points-of-presence-how-we-built-a-distributed-ingestion/) which place ingestion servers around the world and close to your users. When a Session Replay event is transmitted, the user’s browser connects and transmits the event payload to the closest PoP available for their region. This greatly reduces end-to-end latency and minimizes the amount of networking overhead placed on the browser.
- The SDK is built to gracefully downgrade when needed. In the event several thousand DOM mutations happen at once, the SDK will disable recording to make sure recording the website doesn't further degrade user experience. The [mutation limit values are configurable](/platforms/javascript/session-replay/configuration/#mutation-limits).
