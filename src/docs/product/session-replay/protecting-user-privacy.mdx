## Protecting User Privacy

### HTML Content

To reduce the risk of Potentially Identifiable Information (PII) being ingested and stored on our servers, Sentry’s Session Replay SDK is designed to be “private by default”. The Session Replay SDK in its default configuration redacts **all** HTML text nodes and images before it leaves the browser. During playback, redacted text nodes and images are clearly denoted using asterisks and static gray boxes, respectively.

To see unredacted HTML content – for example, your static navigation items, menus, and links – you may additionally opt-in static HTML elements that are known not to contain PII by denoting those elements with `$classname`. It’s strongly recommended not to opt-in any known, user-generated content.

Alternatively, you can turn off the default privacy configuration, which will cause all text nodes and images to be transferred unredacted. This is only recommended when working with static content websites known not to contain any sensitive user information. Note that when using this configuration option, failure to carefully identify HTML elements containing PII means risking sensitive content leaving the user’s browser.

To learn more, including available configuration options, see [Session Replay Privacy](/platforms/javascript/session-replay/privacy/).

### User Input

In addition to HTML content, Session Replay records key user interactions like mouse movements, mouse clicks, and keyboard presses. By default, all user keypresses are redacted and replaced with asterisks. Captured mouse movements are limited to source and target destinations (for example, where the mouse came from and where it went, not the exact path). A low-fidelity approximation of this movement is recreated during playback.

### Breadcrumbs and other Metadata

To assist in debugging, Session Replay captures additional metadata like console.log entries, network requests, browser, operating system, and more. By default, Sentry scans this data on the server and automatically removes potentially sensitive strings like credit card numbers, social security numbers, API tokens, and more. This same process is applied to other Sentry event types like Errors and Transactions.
