<Note>

Session Replay is currently in beta. Beta features are still in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony. If you have any questions or feedback, please email us at [session-replay@sentry.io](mailto:session-replay@sentry.io).

**Currently, this feature is supported for only browser JavaScript, including these frameworks:**

- Angular
- Ember
- Gatsby
- Next.js
- React
- Remix
- Svelte
- Vue

</Note>

Get to the root cause of an error or latency issue faster by seeing all the technical details related to that issue in one visual replay on your web application. **Session Replay** provides a video-like reproduction of user interactions on a site or web app. All user interactions — including page visits, mouse movements, clicks, and scrolls - are captured, helping developers connect the dots between a known issue and how a user experienced it in the UI.
