Sampling is the process of taking a representative sample of your data to create an overall picture of the performance of your application. This isn’t typically necessary at lower volumes of data, but as volumes increase, it becomes less useful to store all data. That’s where sampling comes in.

You can use your SDK sample rate to control how much and what type of data you send to Sentry. However, it can often be difficult to decide what an appropriate sample rate would be, and this can change over time. We recommend you send us 100% of your data and let us manage the sampling. Here’s why.

## Automatic Sampling for High Quality Data

If you’re using our [Dynamic Sampling](/product/data-management-settings/dynamic-sampling/) feature, Sentry automatically applies intelligent dynamic sampling to your data at higher volumes. This allows you to scale up affordably without having to micromanage your SDK sampling configuration.

## Avoid Data Gaps

If you set too low a sample rate in your SDK, you might end up with performance blind spots. Just because you don’t see a problem, it doesn’t mean it’s not there. The more data you send us, the more accurate a picture you’ll have of the overall performance of your application.

## Sufficient Troubleshooting Data

When we sample, we make sure you have enough data for troubleshooting. You can be confident that the data you’re getting will allow you to dig as deep as you need to fix problem areas in your application.
