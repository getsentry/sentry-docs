The information on this page, and our [Dynamic Sampling](/product/data-management-settings/dynamic-sampling/) feature, applies only to transaction events. For information about setting sample rates in the SDK for errors, check out our SDK documentation.

_Sampling_ is a way to manage your application’s scale while ensuring you have the comprehensive transaction data to manage the performance and health of your application. At low volumes, storing all your data is feasible and reasonable, but as your application scales, storing a raw copy of everything has diminishing returns. That’s where sampling comes in.

Dynamic sampling is better than using your SDK to control how much data you send to Sentry. It’s difficult to decide what an appropriate client side sample rate would be, and this can change over time. We recommend you send us 100% of your data and let us manage the sampling. Here are the benefits.

## Automatic Sampling for High Quality Data

If you’re using our [Dynamic Sampling](/product/data-management-settings/dynamic-sampling/) feature, Sentry automatically applies intelligent dynamic sampling to your data at higher volumes. This allows you to scale up affordably without having to micromanage your SDK sampling configuration. We’ll take care of picking valuable samples to retain on your behalf.

Our dynamic sampling works best when you send us as much data as you can. The more a complete picture of your application, the better decisions we make on your behalf to retain data and detect and create new issues. If feasible send us 100% of your data (or set your SDK sample rate to 1.0). If you can’t do so initially the system will operate on what it can see and when you purchase more transaction volume we’ll adapt automatically. As a bonus your per-transaction pricing goes down accordingly.

## Avoid Data Gaps

If you set too low a sample rate in your SDK, you might end up with performance blind spots. Just because you don’t see a problem, it doesn’t mean it’s not there. The more data you send us, the more accurate a picture you’ll have of the overall performance of your application.

If you set too low a sample rate in your SDK, you might end up with performance blind spots. Just because you don’t see a problem, it doesn’t mean it’s not there. With a low sample rate and a recurring issue eventually Sentry will see it, but the delay could have consequences.

With Dynamic Sampling, Sentry calculates accurate metrics, like p95 response time, on the full breadth of the data you send to us. A comprehensive view means that trending, monitoring, and alerting are more accurate and you can respond to changes in your application faster. Put simply the more data you send us, the more accurate and up to date a picture you’ll have of the overall performance of your application.

## Sufficient Troubleshooting Data

When we sample, we make sure you have enough data for troubleshooting. You can be confident that the data you’re getting will allow you to dig as deep as you need to fix problem areas in your application.

At the same time you want to be sure you have enough data for troubleshooting purposes. It doesn’t make sense to store everything but when there is a problem you need the details. Dynamic Sampling automatically adjusts what data we store for troubleshooting and analysis based on recent releases, environment, and even ignoring low value data like health checks. We also dial back how much raw data is stored as your scale increases. You can be confident that the data you’re getting will allow you to dig as deep as you need to fix problem areas in your application.
