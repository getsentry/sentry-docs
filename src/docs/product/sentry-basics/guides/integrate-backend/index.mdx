This step-by-step tutorial walks you through the flow of setting up and configuring your Sentry account to monitor errors in your `Python` backend application. As part of this tutorial, you will:

- Add basic configurations to the Sentry SDK
- Monitor various types of events and errors to Sentry
- Implement error tracing between your frontend and backend applications

<Note>

We provided the source code for a sample `Django` application to use along with this guide. This allows us to streamline the steps required to getting the maximum value out of integrating Sentry into your development workflow.

Alternatively, you can follow this guide as a reference and apply the relevant changes directly to your source code.
