This step-by-step tutorial walks you through the flow of setting up and configuring your Sentry account to monitor errors in a frontend application. After completing this tutorial, you can:

- Receive alerts when errors occur in your code
- Receive a readable stack trace with source code context
- View suspect commits and suggested assignees based on commit information and stack trace.

**Note:** We provided the source code for a sample React application to use along with this guide. This allows us to streamline the steps required to getting the maximum value out of integrating Sentry into your development workflow.

Alternatively, you can follow this tutorial as a reference and apply the relevant changes directly to your source code.
