Manage [your notifications](https://sentry.io/settings/account/notifications/) by navigating to **Settings > Accounts > Notifications**.

## Manage Alerts
The "Send Me Alerts" toggle connects you to alerts sent to your teams. If you've toggled "Send Me Alerts" on, that setting serves as your default for each project. You can also fine tune your alerts according to project by choosing between default, on, or off.

## Workflow Notifications
Workflow Notifications are emails sent for issue state changes. Your default choices for notifications are "Always," "Only On Issues I Subscribe To," and "Never." You can also fine tune your workflow notifications according to project by choosing "Default," "Always," "Only On Issues I Subscribe To," or "Never."

## Email Routing
Email routing controls the email address to which notifications are sent for each project. These notifications default to the email address provided when you set up your Sentry account. You can route emails to an alternative email address when, for example, you want to notify only the team associated with a specific project.

## Weekly Reports
Weekly reports are sent by Sentry every week on Mondays. Reports contain a summary of your organization's Sentry activity over the last week. You can fine tune your Weekly Reports by turning reports on or off for each organization.

## Deploy Notifications
Deploy emails are sent to users who have commited to the release that was deployed. Your default choices are "Always," "Only on Deploys with My Commits," and ""

## My Activity
Receive notifications about your specific activity while using Sentry and on any changes on unclaimed issues you've resolved.
