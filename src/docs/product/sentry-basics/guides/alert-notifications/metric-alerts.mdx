Manage metric alerts by navigating to **Alerts** and clicking the "Alert Rules" tab. In this tab, you can see a list of all active rules and you can add new rules or modify existing ones. The minimum role required to create alerts is member. Sentry users with manager or owner permissions can change the minimum role requirement in **Settings > General Settings > Let Members Create and Edit Alerts**.

To create an alert, click "Create New Alert", choose your project, and then select what you want to be alerted about. All of the options except "Issues" create a metric alert.

## 1. Choose Errors or Performance

Select what you want to be alerted about from a number of pre-set alerts under "Errors" or "Performance". Your selection determines some of the alert properties, including whether you're alerted about [errors](/platforms/javascript/usage/#capturing-errors) or [transactions](/product/performance/). Errors provide data around a break, such as new issues or total errors in your project. Transactions provide data on the performance of your application, such as [latency](/product/performance/metrics/#latency) and [failure rate](/product/performance/metrics/#failure-rate). You can also choose to create a custom metric.

When you've made your selection, click "Set Conditions".

## 2: Filter Events

Specify which [environment(s)](/platforms/javascript/configuration/environments/) will use this alert rule. `Environment` is a Sentry supported tag that you can (and should) add to your SDK, unless your SDK automatically detects the environment. Generally, the [tag](/platforms/javascript/enriching-events/tags/) accepts any value but is targeted to refer to your code deployments' naming convention such as _Development_, _Testing_, _Staging_, or _Production_. The environment drop-down list is populated with the environment tag values available in your [Event Stream](/product/accounts/quotas/manage-event-stream-guide/).

Each environment typically necessitates different levels of urgency and workflow. The urgency and workflows you apply to Production alerts might differ from those you apply to alerts originating from your QA environment, for example.

Add filters to narrow down what you'll be alerted about, such as transactions by URL, tags, or other event properties. Depending on the type of alert, you can also set which types of events you want to be alerted about.

## 3: Choose a Metric

Errors and transactions each have different metrics for alerting. This setting is pre-selected based on the choice you made in the previous step, but in some cases you can update it using the "Function" dropdown. Some alerts do not have this setting.

### Error Metrics for Alerting

- `count()`
- `count_unique(...)`

### Transaction Metrics for Alerting

- `avg(...)`
- `percentile(...)`
- `failure_rate()`
- `apdex(...)`
- `count()`
- `p50()`
- `p75()`
- `p95()`
- `p99()`
- `p100()`

## 4: Choose a Time Interval

Choose the time period over which to evaluate your metric. Your choices range between one minute and one day.

<Note>

Sentry evaluates the specified window each minute. For example, if you specify an hour time window, Sentry evaluates:

- 3:00pm: 2:00pm - 3:00pm
- 3:01pm: 2:01pm - 3:01pm
- 3:02pm: 2:02pm - 3:02pm
- ...

</Note>

## 5: Set a Threshold

Thresholds are numerical values that help define an alert trigger. The Warning trigger's threshold **must be breached** before the Critical trigger. Triggers are evaluated approximately every minute from the highest to lowest severity.

## 6: Set an Action

Actions define how you and your team will be alerted. Possible actions include:

- Send an email to a member or team. If sent to a member, the member's personal project alert opt-out settings are overridden.
- Send a [Slack](/product/integrations/slack/) notification.
- Trigger a [PagerDuty](/product/integrations/pagerduty/) incident.
- Send a request to a webhook via [internal integrations](/product/integrations/integration-platform/#internal-integrations).

## 7: Name the Alert & Add a Team

Manage your alert rule by giving it a descriptive name. A descriptive alert rule name specifies the team affected and the topic of the alert. For example, "Frontend Latency," "Backend Failure Rate," or "Billing Apdex."

You can choose a team to associate with an alert so that members of the that team can edit this alert. Note that you can only make this association if you are a member of the team.
