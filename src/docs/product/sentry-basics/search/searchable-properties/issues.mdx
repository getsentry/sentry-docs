## Searchable Properties

Below is a list of keys and tokens that can be used in the issues search.

<DefinitionList>

### `age`

Returns issues created since the time defined by the value. The syntax is similar to the Unix find command. Supported suffixes: `m - minutes`, `h - hours`, `d - days`, `w - weeks`. For example, `age:-24h` returns isssues that are new in the last 24 hours, while `age:+12h` returns ones that are older than 12 hours. Entering `age:+12h age:-24h` would return issues created between 12 and 24 hours ago.

- **Type:** team or org user

### `assigned_or_suggested`

Returns issues that are either assigned to or suggested as something that should be assigned to defined user(s) or team(s).
