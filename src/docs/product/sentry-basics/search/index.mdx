Search is available on several features throughout [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) such as **Issues** and **Releases**.

<Alert title="Looking for information on searching and Discover?" level="info">

**Discover** is Sentry's powerful query builder for aggregating raw event data and has its own unique syntax not covered here. For more information, see [full Discover documentation](/product/discover-queries/).

</Alert>

## Syntax

Search queries are constructed using a `key:value` pattern, with an optional raw search at the end. Each `key:value` pair is a `token` and the optional raw search is itself a single `token`. The `key:value` pair `tokens` are treated as issue or event properties. The optional raw search is treated as a single `token` and searches event titles/messages.

For example:

```
is:resolved user.username:"Jane Doe" server:web-8 example error
```

In the example above, there are three keys (`is:`, `user.username:`, `server:`), but four tokens:

- `is:resolved`
- `user.username:"Jane Doe"`
- `server:web-8`
- `example error`

The tokens `is:resolved` and `user.username:"Jane Doe"` are standard search tokens because both use reserved keywords. See [Issue Properties](/product/sentry-basics/search/searchable-properties/#issue-properties) and [Event Properties](/product/sentry-basics/search/searchable-properties/#event-properties) for appropriate keyword usage. The token `server:web-8` is pointing to a custom tag sent by the Sentry SDK. See [Custom Tags](/product/sentry-basics/search/searchable-properties/#custom-tags) for more information on how to set tags.

The token `example error` is utilizing the optional raw search and is passed as part of the issue search query (which uses a CONTAINS match similar to SQL). When using the optional raw search, you can provide _one_ string, and the query uses that entire string.

<Note>

Search for [Releases](/product/releases/) supports raw text but not query syntax.

</Note>

### Using `OR` and `AND`

<Note>

`OR` and `AND` search conditions are only available for [Discover](/product/discover-queries/), [Performance](/product/performance/), and [Metric Alerts](/product/alerts-notifications/metric-alerts/).

</Note>

Use `OR` and `AND` between tokens, and use parentheses `()` to group conditions. `AND` can also be used between non-aggregates and aggregates. However, `OR` cannot.

- Non-aggregates filter data based on specific tags or attributes. For example, `user.username:jane` is a non-aggregate field.

- Aggregates filter data on numerical scales. For example, `count()` is an aggregate function and `count():>100` is an aggregate filter.

Some examples of using the `OR` condition:

```
# a valid `OR` query
browser:Chrome OR browser:Opera

# an invalid `OR` query
user.username:janedoe OR count():>100
```

Also, the queries prioritize `AND` before `OR`. For example, "x `AND` y `OR` z" is the same as "(x `AND` y) `OR` z". Parentheses can be used to change the grouping. For example, "x `AND` (y `OR` z)".

### Multiple Values on the Same Key

You can search multiple values for the same key by putting the values in a list. For example, "x:[value1, value2]" will find the the same results as "x:value1 `OR` x:value2". When you do this, the search returns issues/events that match any search term.

An example of searching on the same key with a list of values:

```
release:[12.0, 13.0]
```

Currently, you can't use this type of search on the keyword `is`.

### Explicit Tag Syntax

We recommend you never use reserved keywords (such as `project_id`) as tags. But if you do, you must use the following syntax to search for it:

```
tags[project_id]:tag_value
```

### Advanced

<Alert title="Note" level="info">

Advanced search is available for organizations on the Developer, Team, and Business plans.

</Alert>

#### Exclusion

By default, search terms use the `AND` operator; that is, they return the intersection of issues/events that match all search terms.

To change this, you can use the negation operator `!` to _exclude_ a search parameter.

```
is:unresolved !user.email:example@customer.com
```

In the example above, the search query returns all Issues that are unresolved _and_ have not affected the user with the email address `example@customer.com`.

#### Wildcards

Search supports the wildcard operator `*` as a placeholder for specific characters and strings.

```
browser:"Safari 11*"
```

In the example above, the search query will match on `browser` values like `"Safari 11.0.2"`, `"Safari 11.0.3"`, etc.

You may also combine operators like so:

```
!message:"*Timeout"
```

In the above example, the search query returns results which do not have message values like `ConnectionTimeout`, `ReadTimeout`, etc.
