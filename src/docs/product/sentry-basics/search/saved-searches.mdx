Sentry allows you to save searches that you find most useful, either for yourself or for your entire organization.

## Saved Searches

The Saved Searches sidebar may be accessed by clicking the "Saved Searches" button at the top right of the **Issues** page.

### Recommended Searches

Recommended searches are common search terms that we think you're likely to use. These premade searches are listed under "Recommended Searches" in the "Saved Searches" sidebar.

### Custom Saved Searches

In addition, you may create your own saved searches. These searches may be visible to just your, or your entire organization. These saved searches are not associated with a specific project, but with all projects across the organization.

1. If the saved searches sidebar is not visible, click "Saved Searches" to open it. Then click the create button.

2. In the modal that opens, name the search and set query and sort order. If you are an organization owner or manager, you will also have the option to make the search visible to all users in your organization. Then click "Save".

### Editing or Deleting a Saved Search

You may edit or delete any of your personal saved searches, as well as organization-wide searches if you are an organization owner or manager. To do so, hover over the entry in the sidebar and open the overflow menu.

## Default Search

You can set a search as the default view you see on the **Issues** page. The default search is visible only to you and is relevant across your projects.

1. Type search terms into the search bar, or select a saved search from the sidebar.

2. Click the "Set as Default" button located in the header.

3. Once defaulted, Sentry will name the search "My Default Search" and return to it whenever you navigate to the **Issues** page.
