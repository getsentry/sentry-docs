description: "Learn more about searchable issue and event properties."
---

Sentry's search provides you with reserved keywords, like `is`, `user`, `server`, and `browser`, that you can use to search on the properties of issues and events (as well as the special case of releases). You can also create [custom tags](#custom-tags) on which to search. This page includes [a canonical list of all available issue and event search properties](#properties-table) as well as guidance for how to use these properties.

## Search Properties

Sentry's searchable properties fall into one of four categories: event, issue, session replay, or release.

### Issue Properties

[Issues](/product/issues/) are an aggregate of one or more error events. Searchable issues properties include status, assignment, aggregate counts, and age. You can search by issue properties in the **Issues** page and in **Dashboards** in the widget builder, depending on your dataset selection.

### Event Properties

Events are the underlying event data captured using Sentry SDKs — that is, errors and transactions.

You can search by event properties in the following [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) pages:

- Discover - in the query builder
- Dashboards - within the widget builder, depending on dataset selection
- Performance - only in transaction summaries
- Replay - on the **Replay** page
- Issues - as indicated in the table below
- Alerts - when creating a metric alert

<Note>

Please note that in Alerts only a limited number of properties are available for [filtering transaction events](/product/alerts/create-alerts/metric-alert-config/#tags--properties).

</Note>

When searching on event properties within the **Issues** page, the search will return any issue that has _one or more events_ matching the supplied event properties filter.

### Replay Properties

[Session Replay](/product/session-replay/) provides a video-like reproduction of user interactions on a site or web app. All user interactions, including page visits, mouse movements, clicks, and scrolls, are captured, helping developers connect the dots between a known issue and how a user experienced it in the UI.

You can search by session replay properties (indicated with an R in the properties table below) on the **Replay** page.

### Release Properties

In **Releases**, you can only search by the following properties:

- `release`
- `release.build`
- `release.package`
- `release.stage`
- `release.version`

However, these properties are also searchable in the other pages of [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) listed above (under [Event Properties](#event-properties)).

## Search Tips

Search terms should auto-complete, and when they don't that means you have an invalid dataset. If you enter an invalid search term and tap Return or Enter, an error message is displayed. For example, in **Discover**, you cannot search using a grouping function (properties with a parentheses in the key, for example `epm()`) if you don't already have a grouping function included in the "Results" table columns.

When you search using a property that's a function, if the key includes a parameter, you still need to add a filter or value to have a complete search token. For example, the function `count_unique(field)` takes whichever field you choose as the parameter and then you add a number as your value to filter on. So a typical search might look like: `count_unique(user):>=20`.

Other things to note:

- Search properties that are duration or number types are typically used with a [comparison operator](/product/sentry-basics/search/#comparison-operators) rather than just a colon (`:`) to find exact matches, as an exact match is unlikely to exist.
- Properties with the notation "Doesn't take a parameter" still require a filter or value, but don't take a parameter inside the parentheses. For example, `epm():>12`.
- Default fields/parameters in search functions can be updated. For example, the default parameters `column`, `operator`, and `value` can be updated for `count_if(column,operator,value)`.

## Properties Table

Below is a list of issue-level and event-level keys and tokens reserved and known to Sentry. The columns with just letters represent whether the property is one of:

- E - events
- I - issues
- R - replays

The Xs in these columns of the table indicate whether the property is an event property, an issue property, a replay property or a combination of the three.

<Note>

Release properties overlap with event and issue search properties, so they don't have their own column in the table.

[User Misery](/product/performance/metrics/#user-misery) is a user-weighted performance metric that counts the number of unique users who were frustrated; "frustration" is measured as a response time four times the satisfactory response time threshold (in milliseconds). It highlights transactions that have the highest impact on users. | x |  |  | number |

## Custom Tags

Additionally, you can use any tag you’ve specified as a token. Tags are various key/value pairs that get assigned to an event, and you can use them later as a breakdown or quick access to finding related events.

Most SDKs generally support configuring tags by <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/tags/">configuring the scope</PlatformLink>.

Several common uses for tags include:

- The hostname of the server
- The version of your platform (for example, iOS 5.0)
- The user’s language

## Device Classification

`device.class` provides a simple way for developers to understand the performance level of an event's client device in a single searchable property. This is particularly useful for projects that serve a large range of mobile devices, in which case developers would typically have had to parse through a vast range of specs and models across iOS and Android.

Possible values for `device.class` are `high`, `medium`, and `low`, indicating the estimated performance level of the device. This is a calculated property that is based on the following specs:

| `device.class` for iOS | `model`                             |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| high                   | iPhone 12 series or higher          |
| medium                 | iPhone 7 series to iPhone 11 series |
| low                    | iPhone 6 series or lower            |

| `device.class` for Android | `processor_count` | `processor_frequency` | `memory_size` |
| -------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- | ------------- |
| high                       | >= 8              | >= 2500 MHz           | >= 6 GiB      |
| medium                     | >= 8              | >= 2000 MHz           | >= 4 GiB      |
| low                        | < 8               | < 2000 MHz            | < 4 GiB       |

These classifications are based on an analysis of the mobile devices available in the market today and are subject to change as the market evolves.
