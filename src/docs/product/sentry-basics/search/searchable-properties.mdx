Sentry's Search provides you with reserved keywords, like `is`, `user`, `server`, and `browser`, that you can use to search on the properties of issues and events. You can also create [custom tags](#custom-tags) on which to search. Below are canonical lists of all available issue and event search terms.

## How to Search Where

Issues are aggregated error events, while events can represent errors or transactions. You can search by issue properties in the Issues pages. You can search by event properties in Issues (just the ones indicated), Discover and Performance, in Alerts when creating a metric alert and Dashboards, depending on your data set selection (you can either search using issues or events properties.

The release search properties are the only ones that matter in Releases.

<!-- add para above on main search page as well? -->

When filtering based on functions, if the function takes a parameter, that's part of the key/token and the filter still requires a value to work.

Comparison operator - make sure this is defined somewhere

Things to know:
Search terms should auto-complete, and when they don't that means you have an invalid data set. If you complete the term and hit enter, an error message is displayed. For example, in Discover, you cannot search using a grouping function if you don't already have a grouping function in your Results table columns.
Default parameters in search functions can be updated.

- Discover, Performance = events
- Issues = issues
- Releases = it’s own beast
- Dashboards within the widget builder = issues & events & releases
- Projects and Environment are sometimes dropdown filters

For search properties that are duration or number types, these are typically used with a comparison operator rather than an exact match, as an exact match would be unlikely to exist. Properties with the notation "Doesn't take a parameter" still take a value, but don't use a paramter inside the parentheses. For example, `epm():>12`.

[Issues](/product/issues/) are an aggregate of one or more events. Searchable properties include workflow status, assignment, aggregate counts, and age.

Below is a list of issue-level keys and tokens reserved and known to Sentry.

Events are the underlying event data captured using Sentry SDKs (read: errors and transactions).

When searching on event properties within the **Issues** page, the search will return any issue that has _one or more events_ matching the supplied event filters.

Below is a list of event-level keys and tokens reserved and known to Sentry:

## Properties Table

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

| Key/Token | Description | E   | I   | Type |
| --------- | ----------- | --- | --- | ---- |
| age | Returns issues created since the value defined. The syntax is similar to the Unix find command. Supported suffixes: `m - minutes`, `h - hours`, `d - days`, `w - weeks`. For example, `age:-24` returns isssues that are new in the last 24 hours, while `age:+12h` returns ones that are older than 12 hours. Entering `age:+12h age:-24h` would return issues created between 12 and 24 hours ago. |  | x |  relative time |

## Custom Tags

Additionally, you can use any tag you’ve specified as a token. Tags are various key/value pairs that get assigned to an event, and you can use them later as a breakdown or quick access to finding related events.

Most SDKs generally support configuring tags by <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/tags/">configuring the scope</PlatformLink>.

Several common uses for tags include:

- The hostname of the server
- The version of your platform (for example, iOS 5.0)
- The user’s language
