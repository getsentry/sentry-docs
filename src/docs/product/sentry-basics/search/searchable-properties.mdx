Sentry's search provides you with reserved keywords, like `is`, `user`, `server`, and `browser`, that you can use to search on the properties of issues and events (as well as the special case of releases). You can also create [custom tags](#custom-tags) on which to search. This page includes [a canonical list of all available issue and event search properties](#properties-table) as well as guidance for how to use these properties.

## Search Properties

Sentry's searchable properties fall into one of three categories: event, issue, or release.

### Issue Properties

[Issues](/product/issues/) are an aggregate of one or more error events. Searchable issues properties include status, assignment, aggregate counts, and age. You can search by issue properties in the **Issues** page and in **Dashboards** in the widget builder, depending on your dataset selection.

### Event Properties

Events are the underlying event data captured using Sentry SDKs — that is, errors and transactions.

You can search by event properties in the following [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) pages:

- Discover - in the query builder
- Dashboards - within the widget builder, depending on dataset selection
- Performance
- Issues - as indicated in the table below
- Alerts - when creating a metric alert

When searching on event properties within the **Issues** page, the search will return any issue that has _one or more events_ matching the supplied event properties filter.

In the case of transaction events, we also refer to these properties as _indexed event properties_ because they are based on transaction events for which we store all of the data. This isn't the case for [processed event properties](#processed-event-properties). **For error events, we currently store all data for all events sent to Sentry, and the concept of processed events doesn't apply.** Learn more about indexed and processed transaction events in our full [Sampling documentation](/product/sentry-basics/sampling/).

### Processed Event Properties

<Include name="early-adopter-note.mdx" />

Processed events only apply to transactions and they comprise all the transaction events that you send to Sentry. These events represent aggregate data and underly metrics in the **Performance**, **Discover**, and **Dashboards** features. In **Dashboards**, for the ["Errors & Transactions"](/product/dashboards/widget-builder/#errors--transactions) dataset, we use this aggregate data to generate results if all search conditions and/or columns are processed event properties.

### Release Properties

In **Releases**, you can only search by the following properties:

- `release`
- `release.build`
- `release.package`
- `release.stage`
- `release.version`

However, these properties are also searchable in the other pages of [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) listed above (under [Event Properties](#event-properties)).

## Search Tips

Search terms should auto-complete, and when they don't that means you have an invalid dataset. If you enter an invalid search term and tap Return or Enter, an error message is displayed. For example, in **Discover**, you cannot search using a grouping function (properties with a parentheses in the key, for example `epm()`) if you don't already have a grouping function included in the "Results" table columns.

When you search using a property that's a function, if the key includes a parameter, you still need to add a filter or value to have a complete search token. For example, the function `count_unique(field)` takes whichever field you choose as the parameter and then you add a number as your value to filter on. So a typical search might look like: `count_unique(user):>=20`.

Other things to note:

- Search properties that are duration or number types are typically used with a [comparison operator](/product/sentry-basics/search/#comparison-operators) rather than just a colon (`:`) to find exact matches, as an exact match is unlikely to exist.
- Properties with the notation "Doesn't take a parameter" still require a filter or value, but don't take a parameter inside the parentheses. For example, `epm():>12`.
- Default fields/parameters in search functions can be updated. For example, the default parameters `column`, `operator`, and `value` can be updated for `count_if(column,operator,value)`.

## Properties Table

Below is a list of issue-level and event-level keys and tokens reserved and known to Sentry. The columns with just letters represent whether the property is one of:

- E - events
- I - issues
- PE - processed events

<Note>

Processed event properties are available only if you're in the Early Adopter program. Features available to Early Adopters are still in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony. If you’re interested in being an Early Adopter, you can turn your organization’s Early Adopter status on/off in General Settings. This will affect all users in your organization and can be turned back off just as easily.

</Note>

The Xs in these columns of the table indicate whether the property is an event property, an issue property, a processed event property, or a combination of these.

<Note>

Release properties overlap with event and issue search properties, so they don't have their own column in the table.

[User Misery](/product/performance/metrics/#user-misery) is a user-weighted performance metric that counts the number of unique users who were frustrated; "frustration" is measured as a response time four times the satisfactory response time threshold (in milliseconds). It highlights transactions that have the highest impact on users. | x |  | x | number |

## Custom Tags

Additionally, you can use any tag you’ve specified as a token. Tags are various key/value pairs that get assigned to an event, and you can use them later as a breakdown or quick access to finding related events.

Most SDKs generally support configuring tags by <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/tags/">configuring the scope</PlatformLink>.

Several common uses for tags include:

- The hostname of the server
- The version of your platform (for example, iOS 5.0)
- The user’s language
