Sentry automatically assigns you a Data Source Name (DSN) when you create a project to start monitoring events in your app.

### What the DSN Does

The DSN tells the SDK where to send the events. If this value is not provided, the SDK will try to read it from the `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable. If that variable also does not exist, the SDK will just not send any events.

<Note>

In runtimes without a process environment (such as the browser) that fallback does not apply.

</Note>

### Where to Find Your DSN

If you forget your DSN, view _Settings -> Projects -> Client Keys (DSN)_ in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/).

### The Parts of the DSN

The DSN configures the protocol, public key, server address, and project identifier. It is composed of the following parts:

`{PROTOCOL}://{PUBLIC_KEY}:{SECRET_KEY}@{HOST}{PATH}/{PROJECT_ID}`

For example:

```javascript
Sentry.init({ dsn: "https://public@sentry.example.com/1" });
```

Has the following settings:

- URI = https://sentry.example.com
- Public Key = public
- Secret Key = secret
- Project ID = 1

The resulting POST request for a plain JSON payload would then transmit to `https://sentry.example.com/api/1/store/`.

<Note>

The secret part of the DSN is optional and effectively deprecated. While clients will still honor it, if supplied, future versions of Sentry will entirely ignore it.
