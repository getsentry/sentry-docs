The Release Details page focuses on an individual release. Elements of the release are presented in visual trends for crashes and sessions, specifics regarding each issue, and commit author breakdowns.

Hover over specific dates and times in the overview graph for a quick perspective of events that crashed, behaved abnormally, errored, or are healthy.

Crashed

: The app had an explicit unhandled error or hard crash. You'll typically be able to view the corresponding issue in Sentry that captures this event. To search for them in **Discover** or on the **Issues** page, filter by `handled:no`.

Abnormal

: The application timed out, froze, or was forced to quit by the operating system. There is usually no corresponding Sentry issue, as this is a passive action.

Errored

: The app shut down normally, but the session experienced handled errors. Typically, you'll be able to view any issues/errors in sentry.io.

Healthy

: The session ends normally and no errors occurred during its lifetime.
