Monitor the health of releases by observing user adoption, usage of the application, percentage of [crashes](#crash), and [session data](#session). Release health will provide insight into the impact of crashes and bugs as it relates to user experience, and reveal trends with each new issue through the release details, graphs, and filters.

## Enabling Release Health

Many SDKs automatically manage the start and end of sessions when the SDK is initialized, but release health configuration is key to ensuring you are receiving data that is useful, so check our information on [which SDKs support release health](/product/releases/health/setup/) for links to configuring the SDK, as needed.

## Release Health Data

Once you configure your SDK, Sentry connects the data to the specific release of your application and the associated code.

### Session

The primary component Sentry uses to monitor health is a _session_, which represents the interaction between the user and the application.

A session begins with the start of the application. Or, it begins with bringing the already started application back from background to the foreground.

A session ends with the closing of the application or with the application being sent to the background. If the application is in the background for less than 30 seconds, we do not start the session again. Applications that are active even on the background (for example, a music player) should track the sessions manually for the background process.

Sessions are submitted to Sentry so you can track the usage and adoption of your application. When a user of your application experiences a crash, error, or abnormal exit, the session will be flagged accordingly, and Sentry calculates derived metrics. The metrics include data such as the number of users that didn't experience a crash in the specified time range.

### Active Users

Number of users that started the application at least once in the last 24 hours.

### Crash

The app had an explicit unhandled error or hard crash. You'll typically be able to view the corresponding issue in Sentry that captures this event, and errors that did not cause the end of the application should not be included. To search for them in **Discover** or on the **Issues** page, filter by `handled:no`.

### Crash Free User

Percentage of distinct users who did not experience a crash during the specified time period.

### Crash Free Sessions

Number of sessions in the specified time range that did not end by a crash of the application.

### Crashed Users

Number of users that experienced a crash in the specified time range.

### Release Adoption

Number of users that started at least once during the specified time period of a specific release.

### Release Version

A shorter version of the name = name without the package or short version of the hash.

### Abnormal

The application timed out, froze, or was forced to quit by the operating system. There is usually no corresponding Sentry issue, as this is a passive action.

### Errored

The app shut down normally, but the session experienced handled errors. Typically, you'll be able to view any issues/errors in sentry.io.

### Healthy

The session ends normally and no errors occurred during its lifetime.
