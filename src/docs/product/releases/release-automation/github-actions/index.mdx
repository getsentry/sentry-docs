The [Sentry Release GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/sentry-release) automates Sentry release management in GitHub with just one step. After sending Sentry release information, you'll be able to identify suspect commits that are likely the culprit for new errors. Additionally, releases are used for applying <Link to="/platforms/javascript/sourcemaps/">source maps</Link> to minified JavaScript to view original, untransformed source code.

For more details about Sentry release management concepts, see the full documentation on <Link to="/workflow/releases/">releases</Link>.
