<Note>

This feature is available only if you're in the Early Adopter program. Features available to Early Adopters are still in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony. If you’re interested in being an Early Adopter, you can turn your organization’s Early Adopter status on/off in General Settings. This will affect all users in your organization and can be turned back off just as easily.

## Sorting Releases

On the **Releases** page, you can use the "Sort By" dropdown to sort releases by:
- Date Created
- Total Sessions
- [Active Sessions/Users](/product/releases/health/#active-sessionsusers)
- [Crash Free Sessions/Users](/product/releases/health/#crash-free-sessionsusers)
- Build Number
- [Semantic Version](/platform-redirect/?next=/configuration/releases/%23bind-the-version)

## Filtering Releases

Search on the **Releases** page, which supports both raw text and query syntax. If you are using our [Semantic Versioning](/platform-redirect/?next=/configuration/releases/%23bind-the-version) format, you can use the following query tokens:

- `release` - Search based on string comparison
- `release.package` - Search releases with matching package names
- `release.version` - Search releases with matching semantic version. Supports ranges and wildcards (for example, `release.version:>7.8` or `release.version:1.2.*`)
- `release.build` - Search releases with matching build numbers
- `release.stage` - Search releases with matching adoption stage. Can be `adopted`, `low_adoption` or `replaced`. Learn more about [Release Adoption Stages](/product/releases/health/#adoption-stages).

Learn more about search queries in our [full Search documentation](/product/sentry-basics/search/).
