When you change the date range, Sentry recalculates the values. Sentry doesn't provide the _average_ value of the daily crash-free users or daily crash-free sessions, but the _actual_ value of those metrics calculated for the selected time period. The number can significantly change based on the selected time range.

For example, if you selected the 24-hour time range, have seven users that are using your application for seven days, and each day one of them experiences a crash. The Release Index page will show you that every day there were 85.7% crash-free users on the release.

By contrast, let's say you selected the seven-day time range, have seven users, and each day a different user experiences a crash. By the end of the week, the Release Index page will show you the project had 0% crash-free users.
