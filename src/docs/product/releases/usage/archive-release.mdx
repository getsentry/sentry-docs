Since an event received from a deleted release automatically recreates it, Sentry has an option to hide, or archive, releases. Archiving can also be useful if you're no longer interested in viewing a release or if you've accidentally created a release you no longer want to track.

## Using Sentry.io

Archiving in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) removes the release from the list of releases you can select to view:

![archive release ui](release-archive.png)

Archived releases won't show up in **Releases** unless you change the filter to display them:

## Using the CLI

In the CLI, run this command to archive a release:

```bash
sentry-cli releases archive VERSION
```
