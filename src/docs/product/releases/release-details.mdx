The **Release Details** page focuses on an individual release. Elements of the release are presented in visual trends for crashes and sessions, specifics regarding each issue, adoption graphs, and commit author breakdowns.

## Graphs

The graph at the top of the page provides insights into the health of your release by allowing you to choose which metric it displays. Select the time range that you want to review (the default range is the entire release period) and choose from these metrics in the table below the graph:

- [Crash free session](/product/releases/health/#crash-free-sessionsusers) rate
- [Healthy](/product/releases/health/#healthy), [abnormal](/product/releases/health/#abnormal), [errored](/product/releases/health/#errored) session rate
- [Crashed session](/product/releases/health/#crashed-users) rate
- [Failure rate](/product/performance/metrics/#failure-rate)
- [Session](/product/releases/health/#session) count
- Error count
- Transaction count

In the table below the graph, percentage-based metrics of this release are compared to the average of all releases so you can spot any differences in trend.

[Errored](/product/releases/health/#errored) sessions are likely to result in handled issues, and [crashed](/product/releases/health/#crash) sessions in unhandled issues. Click on the handled/unhandled issues link to see them in [Issues](/product/issues/) page.

Click on any option in the graph legend to hide it. For example, you might hide Healthy sessions to see Crashes in better scale.

Hover over specific dates and times in the overview graph for a quick perspective of events that crashed, behaved abnormally, errored, or are healthy, as defined for [Release Health](/product/releases/health/). The graph also displays markers showing adoption stage changes when you view a time period where that is applicable (and you've filtered by a single environment).

## Issues

Use the **Release Details** page to view issues associated with this release and to access them for triage. You can navigate to the [Issues](/product/issues/) page by clicking the "Open in Issues" button located at the top of the issues table. The issues in the table are sorted by the number of events in the selected time range. Click the filter buttons to see:
- All Issues
- New Issues
- Unhandled Issues
- Resolved Issues
