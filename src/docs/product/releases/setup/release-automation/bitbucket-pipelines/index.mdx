<Alert level="warning">

If you make changes to your organization slug, you'll need to update your configuration for this integration. Learn more in our [troubleshooting guide](/product/integrations/troubleshooting).

</Alert>

The [Sentry Release Pipe](https://bitbucket.org/sentryio/sentry-new-release) automates Sentry release management in Bitbucket Pipelines with just one step. After sending Sentry release information, youâ€™ll be able to associate commits with releases. You'll also be able to apply source maps to see the original code in Sentry.

For more details about Sentry release management concepts, see the full documentation on [releases](/product/releases/).
