<Alert level="warning">

If you make changes to your organization slug, you'll need to update your configuration for this integration. Learn more in our [troubleshooting guide](/product/integrations/troubleshooting).

The Sentry Netlify build plugin automates Sentry release management in Netlify. Once set up, it automatically sends release and commit information to Sentry, and uploads source maps, enabling you to see original code in your stackraces.

Full docs are available in the [plugin's README](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-netlify-build-plugin).

For more details about Sentry release management concepts, see our docs on [releases](/product/releases/).

<Alert level="note">

Note: This build plugin is separate from `@netlify/sentry`, which is a monitoring plugin built by Netlify. Docs for that plugin can be found [here](https://docs.netlify.com/netlify-labs/experimental-features/sentry-integration/). For more information, see [`@sentry/netlify-build-plugin` vs. `@netlify/sentry`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-netlify-build-plugin#sentrynetlify-build-plugin-vs-netlifysentry).
