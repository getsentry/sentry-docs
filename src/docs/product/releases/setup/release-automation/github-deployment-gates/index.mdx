The [Sentry GitHub Deployment Gates](https://github.com/apps/sentry-deployment-gate) allows Sentry to interact with GitHub releases via deployment protection rules. After sending Sentry release information, you can watch a release for errors and reject a canary release before it is fully deployed.

For more details about Sentry Deployment Gate, see the [GitHub Application](https://github.com/apps/sentry-deployment-gate).
