Setting up releases fully is a multi-step process, and is adaptable to your organization's needs.

## Configure Your SDK

With your [SDK configured](/platform-redirect/?next=/configuration/releases/) to provide a release identifer and enable session tracking, you can monitor both [releases](/product/releases/) and [release health](/product/releases/health/).

## Notify Sentry

<Note>

You must have the environment [configured in your SDK](/platform-redirect/?next=/configuration/environments/) to use this feature.

</Note>

Notifying Sentry of a release enables auto discovery of which commits to associate with a release and identifies what we consider "the most recent release" when searching in sentry.io. In addition, telling Sentry of a release helps identify new issues, regressions, and whether an issue is resolved in the next release. You do not need a repository integration for any of these features, though we recommend [installing a repository integration](/product/releases/setup/release-automation/) for efficiency.

### Using Release Automation

If you're using [Release Automation](/product/releases/setup/release-automation/), let Sentry know youâ€™ve deployed by sending an additional request after creating a release:

```bash
sentry-cli releases --org ORGANIZATION_SLUG deploys new VERSION -e ENVIRONMENT
```

NOTE: Make sure you have a [token](https://docs.sentry.io/product/cli/configuration/) properly configured.

You can also use our [API](/api/releases/create-a-new-deploy-for-an-organization/) to create a deploy.

### Using Sentry.io

When you notify Sentry that you've deployed a release to a new environment, we can automatically send an email to Sentry users who have committed to the release being deployed.

## Enable Suspect Commits

With an additional repository integration or manual commits, you can also track suspect commits.

1. [Installing a repository integration](/product/releases/setup/release-automation/) (this step is optional, but highly recommended)
2. [Associating commits to a release](/product/releases/suspect-commits/) by adding to your release management script when you build a release.
