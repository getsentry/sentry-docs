In your release process, you can add a step to create a release in Sentry and associate it with commits from your linked repository. When you've done this, you'll be able to see suspect commits and suggested assignees in issues, as well as resolve issues by commit, as described below.


If you're using one of our [release automation](/product/releases/setup/release-automation/) options or our [manual setup](/product/releases/setup/manual-setup-releases/) instructions, suspect commits should already be enabled. However, we've included directions for enabling suspect commits using the [Sentry CLI](#using-the-cli) and [our API](#using-the-api) at the end of this page, just in case you need them. 

## Suspect Commits & Suggested Assignees

When you've enabled suspect commits, we can tie together the commits in the release, including:

- Files touched by those commits
- Files observed in the stack trace
- Authors of those files
- The issue number in a commit message

Suspect commits and suggested assignees will then display on the **Issue Details** page in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io):

## Resolve Issues by Commit

Additionally, when you've enabled suspect commits, you'll be able to resolve issues by including the issue ID in your commit message. You can find the issue ID at the top of the **Issue Details** page, next to the assignee dropdown. 

A commit message might look like this, for example:

```bash
Prevent empty queries on users

Fixes SENTRY-317
```

When Sentry sees this commit, we’ll reference the commit in the issue, and when you create a release in Sentry, we’ll mark the issue as resolved in that release.

<Note>

If you’re using GitHub, you may have a privacy setting enabled that prevents Sentry from identifying the user’s actual email address. To use the suggested owners feature, uncheck “Keep my email address private” in GitHub’s [account settings](https://github.com/settings/emails).

</Note>

## Enable Suspect Commits

We recommend using Sentry’s [Command Line Interface](/product/cli/releases/) or [our API](/product/releases/setup/manual-setup-releases/#using-the-api) to add this step in your release process, whether you're doing this manually or using release automation. If you're using one of our [release automation](/product/releases/setup/release-automation/) options or our [manual setup](/product/releases/setup/manual-setup-releases/) instructions, this step should already be included, but we've included the relevant code below just in case.

This process assumes:

- The SDK is [configured to provide a release identifier](/platform-redirect/?next=/configuration/releases/)
- Source maps — or your platform-specific files for mapping transformed source code to the original source — have been uploaded (check out the docs for your [specific platform](/platforms/))

### Using the CLI

In this CLI example, the `--auto` flag determines the repository name automatically, and associates commits between the previous release’s commit and the current head commit with the release.

<Note>

If the previous release doesn't have any commits associated with it, we’ll use the latest 20 commits.

</Note>

```bash
# Assumes you're in a git repository
export SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=...
export SENTRY_ORG=my-org
VERSION=$(sentry-cli releases propose-version)

# Create a release
sentry-cli releases new -p project1 -p project2 $VERSION

# Associate commits with the release
sentry-cli releases set-commits --auto $VERSION
```

For more control over which commits to associate, or if you're unable to execute the command inside the repository, you can manually specify a repository and range.

The following example associates commits (or refs) between `from` and `to` with the current release, where `from` is the previous release’s commit. The repository name `my-repo` should match the name you entered when linking the repo using the form `owner-name/repo-name`. The `from` commit is optional; we’ll use the previous release’s commit as the baseline if it is excluded.

```bash
sentry-cli releases set-commits --commit "my-repo@from..to" $VERSION
```

### Using the API

<Note>

Confirm you’re using [Auth Tokens](/api/auth/#auth-tokens), **not** [API Keys](/api/auth/#api-keys), which are deprecated.

</Note>

```bash
# Create a new release
curl https://sentry.io/api/0/organizations/:organization_slug/releases/ \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {TOKEN}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '
 {
 "version": "2da95dfb052f477380608d59d32b4ab9",
 "refs": [{
 "repository":"owner-name/repo-name",
 "commit":"2da95dfb052f477380608d59d32b4ab9",
 "previousCommit":"1e6223108647a7bfc040ef0ca5c92f68ff0dd993"
 }],
 "projects":["my-project","my-other-project"]
}
'
```

If you’d like to have more control over what order the commits appear in, you can send us a list of all commits. That might look like this:

```python
import subprocess
import requests

SENTRY_API_TOKEN = <my_api_token>
sha_of_previous_release = <previous_sha>

log = subprocess.Popen([
    'git',
    '--no-pager',
    'log',
    '--no-merges',
    '--no-color',
    '--pretty=%H',
    '%s..HEAD' % (sha_of_previous_release,),
], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)

commits = log.stdout.read().strip().split('\n')

data = {
    'commits': [{'id': c, 'repository': 'my-repo-name'} for c in commits],
    'version': commits[0],
    'projects': ['my-project', 'my-other-project'],
}

res = requests.post(
    'https://sentry.io/api/0/organizations/my-org/releases/',
    json=data,
    headers={'Authorization': 'Bearer {}'.format(SENTRY_API_TOKEN)},
)
```
