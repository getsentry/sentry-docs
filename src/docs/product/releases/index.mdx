description: "Learn how to provide information to Sentry about your releases to determine regressions and resolve issues quickly."
---

A _release_ is a version of your code deployed to an environment. When you notify Sentry about a <SandboxLink scenario="oneRelease" projectSlug="react">release</SandboxLink>, you can easily identify new issues and regressions, determine whether an issue is resolved in the next release, and apply source maps or other mapping files. The **Releases** page provides a visualization of your releases. It presents adoption of releases from the past 24 hours and provides a high-level view of:

- Each release version (a short version of the release name without the hash)
- The associated project
- The adoption stage of each release
- The authors of each commit
- The percentage of crash-free users
- The percentage of crash-free sessions

Notifying Sentry of a release enables auto discovery of which commits to associate with a release and identifies what we consider "the most recent release" when searching in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

Each release links to one or more projects. If a release has multiple projects, Sentry will duplicate the release data in relation to each one. From this page, you can also click any release to go to [Release Details](/product/releases/release-details/) for more information.

Releases offer significant additional features when [fully configured](/product/releases/setup/):

- Determine the issues and regressions introduced in a new release
- Predict which commit caused an issue and who is likely responsible
- Resolve issues by including the issue number in your commit message
- [Receive email notifications when your code gets deployed](/product/alerts/notifications/#deploy-notifications)

<Note>

We recommend notifying Sentry about a new release before deploying it. But if you don’t, Sentry will automatically create a release entity in the system the first time it sees an event with that release identifier.

</Note>

You don't need a repository integration for any of these features, though we recommend [installing one as part of an automated release option](/product/releases/setup/release-automation/) for efficiency.

## Apply Source Maps or Other Debug Files {#apply-source-maps}

Releases are required to apply [source maps](/platforms/javascript/sourcemaps/) (for our JavaScript SDK) or other debug files, so that you can view source code context obtained from stack traces in their original untransformed form. This is useful for debugging files that are processed — that is bundled, minified, transpiled, compiled, or otherwise obfuscated by tools like Webpack, Terser, or the C++ compiler — from a higher-level language.

## Add Commits

With releases, you can [associate commits](/product/releases/adding-commits/), which keeps track of the commits that were used in a release.

You can resolve issues quickly using the **Release Details** page to view which commits were used to create a release as the list of authors of those commits.

## Track Release Health

_Release health_ provides insight into the impact of crashes and bugs as it relates to your user's experience and reveals trends with each new issue. Monitor [release health](/product/releases/health/) by observing user adoption, usage of the application, percentage of crashes, and session data. You can explore the health of a release more closely in the [Release Details](/product/releases/release-details/) page.

You can view release health data either from the <SandboxLink scenario="oneIssue" projectSlug="react">Issue Details</SandboxLink> page by selecting the commit ID listed under Last Seen", or from the **Releases** page.
