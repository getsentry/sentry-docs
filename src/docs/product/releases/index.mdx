A release is a version of your code that is deployed to an environment. When you give Sentry information about your releases, you unlock a number of new features:

- Determine the issues and regressions introduced in a new release
- Predict which commit caused an issue and who is likely responsible
- Resolve issues by including the issue number in your commit message
- Receive email notifications when your code gets deployed

Additionally, releases are used for applying [source maps](/platforms/javascript/sourcemaps/) to minified JavaScript to view original, untransformed source code.

## Setting up Releases

Setting up releases fully is a 4-step process:

1.  [Configure Your SDK](#configure-sdk)
2.  [Install Repository Integration](#install-repo-integration)
3.  [Create Release and Associate Commits](#create-release)
4.  [Tell Sentry When You Deploy a Release](#create-deploy)

### Configure Your SDK {#configure-sdk}

Include a release ID (a.k.a version) where you configure your client SDK. This is commonly a git SHA or a custom version number.

There are a few restrictions -- the release name cannot contain newlines, spaces, or "\\\", be ".", "..", or exceed 200 characters.

**Note:** Releases are global per organization, so make sure to prefix them with something project-specific.

<PlatformContent includePath="set-release" />

How you make the version available to your code is up to you. For example, you could use an environment variable that is set during the build process.

This tags each event with the release value. We recommend that you tell Sentry about a new release before deploying it, as this will unlock a few more features (explained in Step 2). But if you don’t, Sentry will automatically create a release entity in the system the first time it sees an event with that release ID.

After this, you should see information about the release, such as new issues and regressions introduced in the release.

### Install Repository Integration {#install-repo-integration}

This step is optional - you can manually supply Sentry with your own commit metadata if you wish. Skip ahead to [this section](#alternatively-without-a-repository-integration) to learn how to do this.

Using one of Sentry's repository integrations (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.) is the easiest way to connect your commit metadata to Sentry. For a list of available integrations, go to Organization Settings > Integrations.

**Note:** You need to be an Owner or Manager of your Sentry organization to set up or configure an integration. Read more about [roles in Sentry](/accounts/membership/).

![](releases-repo-integrations.png)

Once you are in Organization Settings > Integrations and have installed the integration, click the 'Configure' button next to your instance.

![](releases-repo-add.png)

In the 'Repositories' panel, click 'Add Repository', and add any repositories you'd like to track commits from. The integration will then send Sentry metadata (such as authors and files changed) about each commit pushed to those repositories.

If you’re linking a GitHub repository, ensure you have Admin or Owner permissions on the repository, and that Sentry is an authorized GitHub app in your [GitHub account settings](https://github.com/settings/applications).

If you’re still having trouble adding it, you can try to [disconnect](https://sentry.io/account/settings/identities/) and then [reconnect](https://sentry.io/account/settings/social/associate/github/) your GitHub identity.

### Create Release and Associate Commits {#create-release}

In this step, you tell Sentry about a new release and which commits are associated with it. This allows Sentry to pinpoint, which commits likely caused an issue, and allow your team to resolve issues by referencing the issue number in a commit message.

#### Associate Commits with a Release

In your release process, add a step to create a release object in Sentry and associate it with commits from your linked repository.

There are 2 ways of doing this:

1.  Using Sentry’s [Command Line Interface](/cli/#sentry-cli) (**recommended**)
2.  Using the API

##### Using the CLI

```bash
# Assumes you're in a git repository
export SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=...
export SENTRY_ORG=my-org
VERSION=$(sentry-cli releases propose-version)

# Create a release
sentry-cli releases new -p project1 -p project2 $VERSION

# Associate commits with the release
sentry-cli releases set-commits --auto $VERSION
```

**Note:** You need to make sure you’re using [Auth Tokens](/api/auth/#auth-tokens), **not** [API Keys](/api/auth/#api-keys), which are deprecated.

In the above example, first, we're using environment variables to configure the CLI (see [_Working with Projects_](/cli/configuration/#sentry-cli-working-with-projects) for other possible ways), and then the `propose-version` sub-command to determine a release ID automatically. Next, we’re creating a release tagged `VERSION` for the organization `my-org` for projects `project1` and `project2`. Finally, we’re using the `--auto` flag to determine the repository name automatically, and associate commits between the previous release’s commit and the current head commit with the release. If the previous release doesn't have any commits associated with it, we’ll use the latest 20 commits.

If you want more control over which commits to associate, or are unable to execute the command inside the repository, you can manually specify a repository and range:

```bash
sentry-cli releases set-commits --commit "my-repo@from..to" $VERSION
```

Here we are associating commits (or refs) between `from` and `to` with the current release, `from` being the previous release’s commit. The repository name `my-repo` should match the name you entered when linking the repo in the previous step, and is of the form `owner-name/repo-name`. The `from` commit is optional and we’ll use the previous release’s commit as the baseline if it is excluded.

For more information, see the [CLI docs](/cli/releases/).

###### Finalizing Releases

By default a release is created “unreleased”. Finalizing a release means that we fill in a second timestamp on the release record, which is prioritized over `date_created` when sorting releases in the UI. This also affects what counts as "the next release" for resolving issues, what release is used as the base for associating commits if you use `--auto`, and creates an entry in the Activity stream.

This can be changed by passing either `--finalize` to the `new` command which will immediately finalize the release or you can separately call `sentry-cli releases finalize VERSION` later on. The latter is useful if you are managing releases as part of a build process e.g.

```bash
#!/bin/sh
sentry-cli releases new "$VERSION"
# do your build steps here
# once you are done, finalize
sentry-cli releases finalize "$VERSION"
```

You can also choose to finalize the release when you've made the release live (when you've deployed to your machines, enabled in the App store, etc.).

##### Using the API

```bash
# Create a new release
curl https://sentry.io/api/0/organizations/:organization_slug/releases/ \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {TOKEN}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '
 {
 "version": "2da95dfb052f477380608d59d32b4ab9",
 "refs": [{
 "repository":"owner-name/repo-name",
 "commit":"2da95dfb052f477380608d59d32b4ab9",
 "previousCommit":"1e6223108647a7bfc040ef0ca5c92f68ff0dd993"
 }],
 "projects":["my-project","my-other-project"]
}
'
```

If you’d like to have more control over what order the commits appear in, you can send us a list of all commits. That might look like this:

```python
import subprocess
import requests

SENTRY_API_TOKEN = <my_api_token>
sha_of_previous_release = <previous_sha>

log = subprocess.Popen([
    'git',
    '--no-pager',
    'log',
    '--no-merges',
    '--no-color',
    '--pretty=%H',
    '%s..HEAD' % (sha_of_previous_release,),
], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)

commits = log.stdout.read().strip().split('\n')

data = {
    'commits': [{'id': c, 'repository': 'my-repo-name'} for c in commits],
    'version': commits[0],
    'projects': ['my-project', 'my-other-project'],
}

res = requests.post(
    'https://sentry.io/api/0/organizations/my-org/releases/',
    json=data,
    headers={'Authorization': 'Bearer {}'.format(SENTRY_API_TOKEN)},
)
```

For more information, see the [API reference](/api/releases/post-organization-releases/).

**Note:** If you receive an "Unable to Fetch Commits" email, take a look at our [Help Center Article](https://help.sentry.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019866834-Why-am-I-receiving-the-email-Unable-to-Fetch-Commits-).

#### After Associating Commits

After this step, **suspect commits** and **suggested assignees** will start appearing on the issue page. We determine these by tying together the commits in the release, files touched by those commits, files observed in the stack trace, authors of those files, and [ownership rules](/workflow/issue-owners/).

![](suspect-commits-highlighted.png)

Additionally, you will be able to resolve issues by including the issue ID in your commit message. You can find the issue id at the top of the issue details page, next to the assignee dropdown. For example, a commit message might look like this:

```bash
Prevent empty queries on users

Fixes SENTRY-317
```

When Sentry sees this commit, we’ll reference the commit in the issue, and when you create a release in Sentry we’ll mark the issue as resolved in that release.

**Note:** If you’re using GitHub, you may have a privacy setting enabled which prevents Sentry from identifying the user’s real email address. If you wish to use the suggested owners feature, you’ll need to ensure “Keep my email address private” is unchecked in GitHub’s [account settings](https://github.com/settings/emails).

#### Alternatively: Without a Repository Integration

If you don’t want Sentry to connect to your repository, or you’re using an unsupported repository provider or VCS (e.g. Perforce), you can tell Sentry about your raw commit metadata via the CLI or the API.

##### Using the CLI

```bash
# Assumes you're in a git repository
export SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=...
export SENTRY_ORG=my-org
VERSION=$(sentry-cli releases propose-version)

# Create a release
sentry-cli releases new -p project1 -p project2 $VERSION

# Associate commits with the release
sentry-cli releases set-commits --auto $VERSION
```

If you don't have a repo-based integration associated with your sentry organization, then the `--auto` flag will automatically use the git tree of your local repo, and associate commits between the previous release's commit and the current head commit with the release. If this is the first release, Sentry will use the latest 20 commits. This behavior is configurable with the `--initial-depth` flag.

Alternatively, you can use the `--local` flag to enable this behavior by default.

```bash
sentry-cli releases set-commits --local $VERSION
```

##### Using the API

To tell Sentry about your commit metadata via the API use the [create release endpoint](/api/releases/post-organization-releases/).

In order for Sentry to use your commits, you must format your commits to match this form:

```json
{
  "commits": [
    {
      "patch_set": [
        { "path": "path/to/added-file.html", "type": "A" },
        { "path": "path/to/modified-file.html", "type": "M" },
        { "path": "path/to/deleted-file.html", "type": "D" }
      ],
      "repository": "owner-name/repo-name",
      "author_name": "Author Name",
      "author_email": "author_email@example.com",
      "timestamp": "2018-09-20T11:50:22+03:00",
      "message": "This is the commit message.",
      "id": "8371445ab8a9facd271df17038ff295a48accae7"
    }
  ]
}
```

`patch_set`

: A list of the files that have been changed in the commit. Specifying the `patch_set` is necessary to power suspect commits and suggested assignees. It consists of two parts:

    `path`
    : The path to the file. Both forward and backward slashes (`'/' '\\'`) are supported.

    `type`
    : The types of changes that happend in that commit. The options are:
        - `Add (A)`
        - `Modify (M)`
        - `Delete (D)`

`repository`

: The full name of the repository the commit belongs to. If this field is not given Sentry will generate a name in the form: `u'organization-<organization_id>'` (i.e. if the organization id is `123`, then the generated repository name will be `u'organization-123`).

`author_email`

: The commit author's email is required to enable the suggested assignee feature.

`author_name`

: The commit author's name may also be included.

`timestamp`

: The commit timestamp is used to sort the commits given. If a timestamp is not included, the commits will remain sorted in the order given.

`message`

: The commit message.

`id`

: The commit id.

##### Create the Release with Patch Data

Below is an example of a full request to the create release endpoint that includes commit metadata:

```bash
curl https://sentry.io/api/0/organizations/your-organization-name/releases/ \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <Token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '
 {
 "version": "2.0rc2",
 "projects":["project-1","project-2"],
 "commits":[
     {
        "patch_set": [
            {"path": "path/to/added-file.html", "type": "A"},
            {"path": "path/to/modified-file.html", "type": "M"},
            {"path": "path/to/deleted-file.html", "type": "D"}
        ],
        "repository": "owner-name/repo-name",
        "author_name": "Author Name",
        "author_email": "author_email@example.com",
        "timestamp": "2018-09-20T11:50:22+03:00",
        "message": "This is the commit message.",
        "id": "8371445ab8a9facd271df17038ff295a48accae7"
    }
 ]
 }
 '
```

For more information, see the [API reference](/api/releases/post-organization-releases/).

### Tell Sentry When You Deploy a Release {#create-deploy}

Tell Sentry when you deploy a release to a new environment.

![release ui](release-ui.png)

And then, we’ll automatically send an email to Sentry users who have committed to the release that is being deployed.

![Deploy emails](deploy-emails.png)

You must have environment [context](/enriching-error-data/additional-data/) set in your SDK in order to use this feature. To let Sentry know you’ve deployed, just send an additional request after creating a release:

```bash
sentry-cli releases deploys VERSION new -e ENVIRONMENT
```

You can also use our [API](/api/releases/post-release-deploys/) to create a deploy.

## Release Artifacts

JavaScript and React Native projects can utilize release artifacts to unminify or symbolicate error stack traces, you can find the artifacts uploaded to Sentry by navigating to **[Project] » Project Settings » Source Maps**.

To learn more, please check out our [Source Maps](/platforms/javascript/sourcemaps/) docs.
