The following document explores the syntax and semantics of the configuration for [Advanced Data Scrubbing], as consumed and executed by [Relay]. Sometimes, this is also referred to as PII scrubbing.

## A Basic Example

If you have an exception message which contains IP addresses that are not supposed to be there, you'd write:

```json
{
  "applications": {
    "$string": ["@ip:replace"]
  }
}
```

It reads as "replace all IP addresses in all strings", or "apply `@ip:replace`to all `$string` fields".

`@ip:replace` is called a rule, and `$string` is a selector.

## Built-in Rules

The following rules exist by default:

- `@ip:replace` and `@ip:hash` for replacing IP addresses.
- `@imei:replace` and `@imei:hash` for replacing IMEIs.
- `@mac:replace`, `@mac:mask` and `@mac:hash` for matching MAC addresses.
- `@email:mask`, `@email:replace` and `@email:hash` for matching email addresses.
- `@creditcard:mask`, `@creditcard:replace` and `@creditcard:hash` for matching credit card numbers.
- `@userpath:replace` and `@userpath:hash` for matching local paths (e.g.`C:/Users/foo/`).
- `@password:remove` for removing passwords. In this case, we're pattern matching against the field's key, whether it contains `password`, `credentials`, or similar strings.
- `@anything:remove`, `@anything:replace` and `@anything:hash` for removing, replacing, or hashing any value. It's essentially equivalent to a wildcard-regex, but will also match more than strings.

## Writing Your Own Rules

Rules generally consist of two parts:

- _Rule types_ describe what to match. See <a class href="https://develop.sentry.dev/pii/types/">PII Rule Types</a> for an exhaustive list.
- _Rule redaction methods_ describe what to do with the match. See <a class href="https://develop.sentry.dev/pii/methods/">PII Redaction Methods</a> for a list.

Each page has examples. Try them by pasting them into the
"PII config" column of [Piinguin] and clicking on fields to get suggestions.

## Interactive Editing

The easiest way to go about this is if you already have a raw JSON payload from some SDK. Go to our PII config editor [Piinguin], and:

1. Paste in a raw event
2. Click on data you want eliminated
3. Paste in other payloads and see if they look ok, go back to step **2** if necessary.

After iterating on the config, paste it back into the project config located at `.relay/projects/<PROJECT_ID>.json`

For example:

```json
{
  "publicKeys": [
    {
      "publicKey": "___PUBLIC_KEY___",
      "isEnabled": true
    }
  ],
  "config": {
    "allowedDomains": ["*"],
    "piiConfig": {
      "rules": {
        "device_id": {
          "type": "pattern",
          "pattern": "d/[a-f0-9]{12}",
          "redaction": {
            "method": "hash"
          }
        }
      },
      "applications": {
        "freeform": ["device_id"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
