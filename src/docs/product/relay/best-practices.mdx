This page reviews our guidelines for operation when self-hosting external Relays, that is, Relays that run on your hardware and forward events to `sentry.io`.

## General Considerations

- We recommend [running Relay](/product/relay/getting-started/#running-relay-in-docker) using the officially provided Docker image (`getsentry/relay`) found on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/getsentry/relay/) and tagged with its Git revision identifier, rather than building from source.

- We recommend running at least two Relay instances (containers) with a reverse proxy (such as [HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.org/) or [Nginx](https://nginx.org)) in front of them for both improved availability and simplified Relay updates.

- To monitor your Relay setup, configure [Logging](/product/relay/#logging-and-healthcheck), [Metrics](/product/relay/metrics/), and [Health Checks](/product/relay/getting-started/#health-checks).

## System Requirements and Recommendations

The following recommendations assume that Relay is run in Docker.

        <li>
          Bandwidth: Make sure you have enough capacity to receive and forward the planned data volume. Relay compresses all upstream requests to <code>sentry.io</code> by default, but the compression rate might vary depending on the types and shapes of the submitted events.
        </li>
        <li>
          Latency: Relay can tolerate network delays up to a certain point. It is however recommended to make sure that the round-trip time to the upstream stays lower than 5 seconds.
        </li>

<p id="multi-core-cpu"><a href="#multi-core-footnote">[1]</a> Relay is a multi-threaded application that tries to leverage all available CPU cores. As a result, Sentry highly recommends running Relay on multi-core CPUs. If your setup is expected to handle more than 100 requests per second, we recommend running Relay on at least four (4) CPU cores.
By default, every Relay instance will use the total number of available cores to adjust the sizes of its thread pools. Adjust this behavior by configuring the <code>limits.max_thread_count</code>.
</p>

## Example Configuration

This example configuration sets up basic logging and metrics settings, as well as changes the default concurrency level.

```yaml
---
relay:
  # The upstream hostname is taken from any of your DSNs.
  # Go to project Settings, and then to "Client Keys (DSN)" to see them.
  upstream: https://o<YOUR_ORG_ID>.ingest.sentry.io.
  host: 0.0.0.0
  port: 3000
logging:
  level: info
  format: json
metrics:
  statsd: 127.0.0.1:8126
  prefix: relay
limits:
  # Base size of various internal thread pools. Defaults to the number of logical CPU cores
  max_thread_count: 8
```

See the [Configuration Options](/product/relay/options/) page for detailed descriptions of all available options.
