This page reviews our guidelines for operation when self-hosting external Relays, that is, Relays that run on your hardware and forward events to `sentry.io`.

## General Considerations

- We recommend running Relay using the officially provided Docker image (`getsentry/relay`) found on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/getsentry/relay/) and tagged with its Git revision identifier, rather than building from source.

- We recommend running at least two Relay instances (containers) with a reverse proxy (such as [HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.org/) or [Nginx](https://nginx.org)) in front of them for both improved availability and simplified Relay updates.

- To monitor your Relay setup, configure both [Logging](/product/relay/#logging-and-healthcheck) and [Metrics](/product/relay/metrics/).

## System Requirements and Recommendations

- CPU
  - x86-64 (amd64) CPU architecture
  - Relay is a multi-threaded application that tries to leverage all available CPU cores. As a result, Sentry highly recommends running Relay on multi-core CPUs. If your set up is expected to handle more than 100 requests per second, we recommend running running Relay on at least four (4) CPU cores.
    - By default, every Relay instance will use the total number of available cores to adjust the sizes of its thread pools. Adjust this behavior by configuring the `limits.max_thread_count`.
- Memory
  - At least 2GB of RAM per Relay container is recommended.
- Storage
  - Relay does not currently require disk storage.

## Example Configuration

This example configuration contains values you can adjust to change both Relay's concurrency settings and buffering behavior.

```yaml
---
relay:
  upstream: https://o<YOUR_ORG_ID>.ingest.sentry.io
  host: 0.0.0.0
  port: 3000
logging:
  level: info
  format: json
metrics:
  statsd: 127.0.0.1:8126
  prefix: relay
limits:
  # Base size of various internal thread pools. Defaults to the number of logical CPU cores
  max_thread_count: 8
  # Number of concurrent upstream requests for event submission
  max_concurrent_requests: 500
cache:
  # How many events relay buffers before it starts dropping new events
  event_buffer_size: 10000
  # How long a project configuration can still be used after having expired (in seconds).
  # This might help when the upstream is unreachable (e.g., in case of network issues).
  project_grace_period: 3600
  # The cache timeout for buffered events before dropping them (in seconds)
  event_expiry: 1800
```

See the [Configuration Options](/product/relay/options/) page for detailed descriptions of all available options.
