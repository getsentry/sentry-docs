Stats can be submitted to a StatsD server by configuring the `metrics.statsd` key. The key
can be set to an `ip:port` tuple:

### Example Configuration

```yaml
metrics:
  # Endpoint of your StatsD server
  statsd: 127.0.0.1:8126
  # Prefix all metric names with this string
  prefix: mycompany.relay
```

All available options for configuring metrics reporting can be found on the [options page](/product/relay/options/#statsd-metrics).
