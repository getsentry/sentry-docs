Getting started with Relay is as simple as using the default settings. You can also configure Relay to suit your organization's needs. Check the [Configuration Options](/product/relay/options/) page for a detailed discussion of operating scenarios.

<Note>
<markdown>

The Relay server is called `relay`. Download binaries from [GitHub
Releases](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/releases). A Docker image is provided on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/getsentry/relay/).

</Note>

## Initializing Configuration

To create the initial configuration, use Relay's `relay config init` command, which puts configuration files in the `.relay` folder under the current working directory:

```shell
❯ ./relay config init
Initializing relay in /<current_directory>/.relay
Do you want to create a new config?:
> Yes, create default config
  Yes, create custom config
  No, abort
```

Select the default configuration to create a minimal configuration file.
You can choose to override the default settings by selecting
_"create custom config"_ and customizing these parameters:

- The `mode` setting, which configures the major mode in which Relay operates. For more information on available Relay modes, refer to [Relay Modes](/product/relay/modes/).

  <Alert level="warning">

  Currently, only `proxy` and `static` mode are available to all organizations.

  </Alert>

- The `upstream` setting configures the server to which Relay will forward the
  events (by default the main `sentry.io` URL).

- The `port` and `host` settings configure the TCP port at which Relay will
  listen. This is the address to which SDKs send events.

- The `tls` settings configure TLS support (HTTPS support), used when  communication between the SDK and Relay needs to be secured.

Settings are recorded in `.relay/config.yml`. Note that all configuration values
are optional and default to these settings:

```yaml
relay:
  mode: managed
  upstream: "https://sentry.io/"
  host: 127.0.0.1
  port: 3000
  tls_port: ~
  tls_identity_path: ~
  tls_identity_password: ~
```

Configurations are fully documented in [Configuration Options](/product/relay/options/).

## Creating Credentials

<Alert level="info">

Not applicable in `proxy` or `static` mode.

</Alert>

In addition to `config.yml`, the `init` command creates a credentials file, `credentials.json`, which is placed in the same `.relay` directory. This file contains both the public and private key Relay uses to authenticate with the upstream server.

**As a result, this file must be protected from modification or view by unauthorized entities.**

A typical credentials file is similar to this example:

```json
{
  "secret_key": "5gkTAfwOrJ0lMy9aOAOmHKO1k6gd8ApYkAInmg5VfWk",
  "public_key": "fQzvlvqLM2pJwLDwM_sXD2Lk5swzx-Oml4WhsOquon4",
  "id": "cde0d72e-0c4e-4550-a934-c1867d8a177c"
}
```

Use the `public_key` to register your Relay with the upstream server when running it in `managed` mode.

## Registering Relay with Sentry

<Alert level="info">

Not applicable in `proxy` or `static` mode.

</Alert>

To operate in `managed` mode, Relay pulls configuration for PII stripping,
filtering, and rate limiting from your organization and project settings in
Sentry. Since these settings may contain sensitive information, their access is
restricted by Sentry and requires authorization.

To register Relay with Sentry:

1. Copy the contents of the public key, either by inspecting the `credentials.json` file or by running:

  ```shell
  ❯ ./relay credentials show
  Credentials:
    relay id: 8cd24a0e-384d-4052-9010-68a21392b33c
    public key: nDJl79SbEYH9-8NEJAI7ezrgYfolPW3Bnkg00k1zOfA
  ```

2. Click on _Settings_ in the main navigation for Sentry, then select _Relays_.

3. Click _New Relay Key_ to add the key and save it:

  ![](edit-relay-key.png)

This process registers Relay with Sentry so it is ready to send messages. See
[Configuration Options](/product/relay/options/) to learn more about Relay configuration options.

## Running Relay

You can either run the Relay binary directly or using a Docker image.

### Running Relay Directly

After registering Relay with Sentry, it is ready to run:

```shell
❯ relay run
 INFO  relay::setup > launching relay from config folder .relay
 INFO  relay::setup >   relay mode: managed
 INFO  relay::setup >   relay id: f2119bc9-9a9b-4531-826b-24e9794902f2
 INFO  relay::setup >   public key: QPBITKKtKUuEZGGbPke8iufEXAcVrEv6nmWrkRtc3l8
 ...
 INFO  relay_server::actors::upstream > relay successfully registered with upstream
```

If you moved your config folder (for example, for security reasons), use the `--config` option to specify the location:

```shell
❯ relay run --config ./my/custom/relay_folder/
```

### Running Relay in Docker

As an alternate to running the Relay binary directly, Sentry provides a
Docker image that can be used to run Relay. It can be found on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/getsentry/relay/).

Similar to running the `relay` binary directly, running the Docker image needs a
directory in which it can find the configuration and credentials files
(`config.yml` and `credentials.json`). Provide the configuration directory using the standard mechanisms offered by Docker, either by mounting
[Docker volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) or by building a new container and copying in the files.

For example, you can configure and start the latest version of `relay` via the following steps:

```shell
# Generate configuration
❯ docker run -it -v $(pwd)/configs/:/work/.relay/ getsentry/relay config init
```

<br />

```shell
# Start Relay
❯ docker run -it -v $(pwd)/configs/:/work/.relay/ getsentry/relay run
```

## Logging

Once Relay is running, you will receive `INFO` messages, such as:

```shell
INFO  relay::setup > launching relay from config folder .relay
INFO  relay::setup >   relay mode: managed
INFO  relay::setup >   relay id: f2119bc9-9a9b-4531-826b-24e9794902f2
INFO  relay::setup >   log level: INFO
```

This example displays the default logging level, which you can modify so it displays either more or less information. For details about configuring logging please see [Logging](/product/relay/options/#logging) on the options page.

## Health Checks

Relay provides two URLs for checking system status:

- `GET /api/relay/healthcheck/live/`: Tests if Relay is running and listening to
  HTTP requests.
- `GET /api/relay/healthcheck/ready/`: Tests if Relay is authenticated with the
  upstream and operating normally.

In case of success, both endpoints return a _200 OK_ response:

```json
{
  "is_healthy": true
}
```

## Sending a Test Event

Once Relay is running and authenticated with Sentry, send a test event.

Get the DSN of your project by navigating to _Project Settings > Client Keys
(DSN)_, which looks similar to:

```
https://12345abcdb1e4c123490ecec89c1f199@o1.ingest.sentry.io/2244
```

Next, replace parts of the DSN to match the address at which Relay is reachable.
For instance, if Relay listens at `http://localhost:3000`, change the protocol
and host of the DSN to:

```
http://12345abcdb1e4c123490ecec89c1f199@localhost:3000/2244
```

Use the new DSN in your SDK configuration. To test this, you can send a message
with `sentry-cli`:

```shell
❯ export SENTRY_DSN='http://12345abcdb1e4c123490ecec89c1f199@127.0.0.1:3000/2244'
❯ sentry-cli send-event -m 'A test event'
```

In a few seconds, the event should appear in the issues stream in your
project.
