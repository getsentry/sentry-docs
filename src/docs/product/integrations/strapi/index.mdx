The [Sentry plugin for Strapi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/strapi-plugin-sentry) lets you track errors in your Strapi application. This way, you can easily find and fix bugs in your content API.

Once installed, this plugin will:

- Initialize a Sentry instance when your Strapi app starts
- Send errors encountered in your application's end API to Sentry
- Attach useful metadata to Sentry events, to help you with debugging
- Expose a global Sentry service

You can find the Strapi plugin's [full documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/strapi/strapi/tree/master/packages/strapi-plugin-sentry#readme).
