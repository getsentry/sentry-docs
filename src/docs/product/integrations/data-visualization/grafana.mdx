<Alert level="warning">

If you make changes to your organization slug, you'll need to update your configuration for this integration. Learn more in our [troubleshooting guide](/product/integrations/troubleshooting).

</Alert>

Visualize your Sentry [Issues](/product/issues/) and [Stats](/product/stats/) data in Grafana with the Sentry [data source plugin](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/grafana-sentry-datasource/). Once installed, you can combine Sentry data with that of other sources, like your infrastructure data through Prometheus or your business data from your data warehouse, in a single dashboard.
