### Integration Platform

Sentryâ€™s [Integration Platform](/workflow/integrations/integration-platform/) provides a way for external services to interact with the Sentry SaaS service using the REST API and webhooks. Integrations utilizing this platform are first-class actors within Sentry, and you can build them for [public](/product/integrations/integration-platform/#public-integrations) as well as [internal](/product/integrations/integration-platform/#internal-integrations) use cases.
