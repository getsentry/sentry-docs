Sentry integrates with many third party services to make your development experience easier. Unfortunately, we can’t always automatically update some of these services when critical data within Sentry is changed. This document is meant to help you navigate any odd behaviour that is to be expected when these settings are changed. In some cases, we may need your team’s manual intervention to get the integration working smoothly again.

## If you've changed your organization slug

- Any integration that create links directly to Sentry issues will continue creating correct links going forward, **but existing links will no longer work as expected**.
  - For example, Slack notifications containing links to Sentry alerts, and Jira tickets which link to Sentry issues
- Most [deployment integrations](https://docs.sentry.io/product/integrations/#deployment) use [Sentry CLI](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cli) under the hood, which requires providing your organization slug via the `SENTRY_ORG` environment variable. For these integrations to continue working, **you must manually update this variable on the appropriate service**.
- If you are using any of the following integrations, you will have to have to manually update the organization slug to maintain functionality:

  - [Bitbucket Pipelines](/product/releases/setup/release-automation/bitbucket-pipelines/)
  - [GitHub Actions](/product/releases/setup/release-automation/github-actions/)
  - [Netlify](/product/releases/setup/release-automation/netlify/)
  - [Vercel](/product/integrations/deployment/vercel/)
  - [Grafana](/product/integrations/data-visualization/grafana/)
