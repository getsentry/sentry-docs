Sentry’s Integration Platform provides a way for external services to interact with Sentry using [webhooks](/product/integrations/integration-platform/webhooks/), [UI components](/product/integrations/integration-platform/ui-components/), and the [REST API](/api). Integrations using this platform are first-class actors within Sentry.


## Creating an Integration

In [sentry.io](https://sentry.io), navigate to **Settings > Developer Settings**. From here, you can choose to create an [internal](/product/integrations/integration-platform/internal-integration) or [public](/product/integrations/integration-platform/public-integration) integration. Internal integrations can only be used by your organization, whereas public integrations can be published and are available for all Sentry users.

There are several configuration options for your integration, which are described briefly below. Each section provides links to more detailed information.

## Webhooks

Webhooks allow your service to get requests about specific resources, depending on your selection. For more information, check out the [full Webhooks documentation](/product/integrations/integration-platform/webhooks/).

## UI Components

The Sentry Integration Platform provides the ability to add rich UI components to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) itself through a  simple, declarative syntax.

For more information, check out the [full UI Components documentation](/product/integrations/integration-platform/ui-components/).

## Alerts

You can make any integration available as an action in [issue alerts](/product/integrations/integration-platform/webhooks/#issue-alerts) and [metric alerts](/product/integrations/integration-platform/webhooks/#metric-alerts) by enabling the "Alert Rule Action" toggle. The integration will then show
up as a service in the action section when creating or updating an alert rule:

For your service to receive webhooks for alert rules, users must add to existing rules or create new ones that have `Send a notification via <your service>` as an action in the rule. Once that's set up, you'll start receiving webhook requests for triggered alerts. For more information about the request and payload, check out the [full Webhooks documentation](/product/integrations/integration-platform/webhooks/).


## Permissions

Permissions specify what level of access your service requires of Sentry resources. The scopes are directly applied to any API tokens issued to the application. For public integrations, Sentry will prompt users to approve these permissions upon installation. For more information, check out the [full documentation on Permissions](/api/permissions/).

![Form that allows developer to set what permissions they'll need from their user.](permissions.png)

You can't create an integration or change an existing integration to have permissions greater than your own user settings. Permissions are scoped to the organization, so adding scopes for issues and events, projects, or teams will enable access to issues and events, projects, or teams across the organization.


## Auth Tokens

Auth tokens are passed using an auth header, and are used to authenticate as a user account with the API. [Public integrations](/product/integrations/integration-platform/public-integration) require an OAuth flow for tokens. [Internal integrations](/product/integrations/integration-platform/internal-integration) automatically generate tokens after installation. For more information, check out the [full Authentication documentation](/api/auth/).


## FAQ

### How is a Sentry integration different from OAuth apps?

OAuth applications allow an external developer to create an application which can authenticate as a Sentry user and take actions as the user within Sentry.

Sentry integrations are similar to OAuth apps, except Sentry integrations act as an independent entity. There is currently no way for a Sentry integration to act on behalf of a user.

### How is a Sentry integration different from personal auth tokens?

Personal auth tokens are tokens that can be used to invoke APIs directly and have access to all the resources tied to that user. A Sentry integration doesn't represent a single user, but rather makes requests as "itself".

### We use the Sentry API internally at our company. Should we switch to the Sentry Integration Platform?

If you're looking for any of the new features below, we recommend you switch to using Sentry integrations and build an [internal integration](/product/integrations/integration-platform/internal-integration).

**Permissions**
OAuth apps and auth tokens allow you to access Sentry as a specific user in your Sentry organization. This means:

- If this user leaves the organization or their permissions change, the integration can break. A Sentry integration, on the other hand, is a separate, independent entity with its own permissions.
- OAuth apps and auth tokens permit the user to access other Sentry organizations they belong to, so there is limited isolation.
- Actions taken in Sentry will connect to this user rather than the integration/app. For example, if your alerting integration automatically assigns issues to a teammate, it will appear in the history as “Alice assigned Bob issue XYZ” rather than “&lt;Your Sentry integration&gt; assigned Bob issue XYZ.”

**Managing Webhooks**
With Sentry integrations you can manage webhooks in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io), as opposed to the current state where you need to make API calls to create/update/delete/retrieve webhooks. This is not only more cumbersome, but also harder to keep track of and makes it difficult to maintain visibility across your team.

**Scope**
Currently, webhooks must be configured per-project, which is added effort especially when adding/removing projects. With Sentry integrations, you’ll receive notifications for all projects in your organization.

**Event Types**
Sentry integrations expose a richer set of events that are not available using the legacy service hooks API. Currently, this includes the following webhooks:
* Issue Created
* Issue Resolved
* Issue Ignored
* Issue Assigned
* Comment Created
* Comment Updated
* Comment Deleted
* Error Created

In the future, we’ll add more types of webhooks to Sentry integrations.
