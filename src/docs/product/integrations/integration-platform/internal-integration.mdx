Internal integrations are meant for custom integrations unique to your organization. They can also be as simple as an organization-wide token. Whether you are using just the API or all the Integration Platform features combined, internal integrations are for use within a single Sentry organization.

Internal integrations don't require an OAuth flow. You receive an org-wide Auth Token immediately after creation.

For an example of how to build an internal integration, see [our Round Robin Issue Assignment integration](https://blog.sentry.io/2019/11/21/customize-your-sentry-workflow-a-sample-internal-integration) (or jump straight to [the code on GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-round-robin)).

## Installation

Creating an internal integration will automatically install it on your organization.

## Auth Tokens

Internal integrations automatically generate an [Authentication Token](/product/integrations/integration-platform/#auth-tokens) when configured. Should you need multiple tokens, or need to get a new one, you can go to **Settings > Developer Settings > [Your Internal Integration]** and do so.
You can have up to 20 tokens at a time for each internal integration.
These tokens do not expire automatically, but you can manually revoke them as needed.
