<Note>

We've built an [example application](https://github.com/getsentry/integration-platform-example) to help you get started with building on Sentry's integration platform. Check it out for useful code snippets for adding these features in Python and TypeScript. See the [docs](/product/integrations/integration-platform/#example-app) for more information.

</Note>

Internal integrations are meant for custom integrations unique to your organization. They can also be as simple as an organization-wide token. Whether you are using just the API or all the integration platform features combined, internal integrations are for use within a single Sentry organization.

Internal integrations don't require an OAuth flow. You receive an org-wide auth token immediately after creation:

For an example of how to build an internal integration, see [our Round Robin Issue Assignment integration](https://blog.sentry.io/2019/11/21/customize-your-sentry-workflow-a-sample-internal-integration) (or jump straight to [the code on GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-round-robin)).

## Installation

Creating an internal integration will automatically install it on your organization.

## Auth Tokens

Internal integrations automatically generate an [authentication token](/product/integrations/integration-platform/#auth-tokens) when configured. If you need multiple tokens, or need to get a new one, you can go to **Settings > Developer Settings > [Your Internal Integration]** and do so.
You can have up to 20 tokens at a time for each internal integration.
These tokens do not expire automatically, but you can manually revoke them as needed.

## Image Requirements

Internal integrations don't require logos or icons to be uploaded, but you can upload them if you want to. The requirements for those are:

- Logo size must be between 256 &times; 256px and 1024 &times; 1024px
- File format must be PNG
- Background must be transparent (unless the logo takes up the entire space)

If the integration has a [UI component](/product/integrations/integration-platform/ui-components), you can also upload an icon that follows these requirements:

- Icon size must be between 256 &times; 256px and 1024 &times; 1024px
- File must be a PNG in RGBA format
- All pixels must be black or transparent
