## Stack Trace Link

This feature allows the developer to insert a link within a stack trace frame. The link contains details about the project, file, line number, etc. It can also be used to view the file on another website, continue debugging in a different monitoring tool, etc. For example, this is what our Rookout integration looks like using stack trace linking.

### Schema

```json
{
  "type": "stacktrace-link",
  "uri": <URI>,
}
```

### Attributes

- `uri` - (Required) The link destination. Sentry will automatically add the following query params to the link.
    - `installationId` - Your integration's installation ID (helps you determine the requesting Sentry org)
    - `projectSlug` - slug of the project the issue belongs to
    - `filename` - full path of the stack frame file
    - `lineNo` - line number of the stack trace in the file

### Example

```json
"elements": [
  {
    "type": "stacktrace-link",
    "uri": "/stacktrace-redirect",
  }
]
```

Any time a component supports a `uri` attribute, Sentry will make a request to the third-party service using the Base URL or their `webhook_url`.

For a more complete description of the grammar, see the [source code](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/blob/master/src/sentry/api/validators/sentry_apps/schema.py).
