The Sentry Integration Platform provides developers with the ability to define components to render within specific parts of [sentry.io](https://sentry.io), through a JSON-based schema.

You can define the following components:
 - [Issue Link](/product/integrations/integration-platform/ui-components/issue-link) (uses [FormField](/product/integrations/integration-platform/ui-components/formfield) components)
 - [Alert Rule Actions](/product/integrations/integration-platform/ui-components/alert-rule-action) (uses [FormField](/product/integrations/integration-platform/ui-components/formfield) components)
 - [Stack Trace Link](/product/integrations/integration-platform/ui-components/stacktrace-link)

## Schema

The UI components are specified in the schema section of the integration details. The required form of this schema is:

```json {filename: schema.json}
{
  "elements": [
    {
      "type": "alert-rule-action",
      "title": "Notify my a channel in my app",
      "settings": {
        "type": "alert-rule-settings",
        "uri": "/sentry/alert-rule",
        "required_fields": [
          {
            "type": "text",
            "label": "Which channel should receive the alert?",
            "name": "channel"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```


## Error Handling

Component rendering either 100% works or shows nothing. To protect the integration from looking chaotic due to errors we have no control over, if any part of the third-party component rendering fails, nothing will render.
