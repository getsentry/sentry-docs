The Sentry Integration Platform provides developers with the ability to define User Interface components to render within specific parts of Sentry's UI, through a JSON-based schema. The possible use-cases are [Issue Link](/product/integrations/integration-platform/ui-components/issue-link), [Stack Trace Link](/product/integrations/integration-platform/ui-components/stacktrace-link), and [Alert Rule Actions](/product/integrations/integration-platform/ui-components/alert-rule-action).


## Error Handling

Component rendering either 100% works or shows nothing. In order to protect the integration from looking chaotic due to errors we have no control over, if any part of the third-party component rendering fails, nothing will render.
