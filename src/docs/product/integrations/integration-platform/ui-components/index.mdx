The Sentry Integration Platform provides developers with the ability to define components to render within specific parts of Sentry's UI, through a JSON-based schema.

The possible use-cases are:
 - [Issue Link](/product/integrations/integration-platform/ui-components/issue-link) (uses FormField components)
 - [Alert Rule Actions](/product/integrations/integration-platform/ui-components/alert-rule-action) (uses FormField components)
 - [Stack Trace Link](/product/integrations/integration-platform/ui-components/stacktrace-link)

## Schema

The UI components are specified in the schema section of the integration details. The required form of this schema is:

```json
{
  "elements": [
    // Each element is a specification for a component the developer wants to use.
    ...
  ]
}
```


## Error Handling

Component rendering either 100% works or shows nothing. In order to protect the integration from looking chaotic due to errors we have no control over, if any part of the third-party component rendering fails, nothing will render.
