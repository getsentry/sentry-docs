## Alert Rule Action

The Alert Rule Action component allows the developer to get parameters to define routing or configuration in alert rules for their service. When alert rules are triggered for a user, the configured service will receive [Issue Alert](/product/integrations/integration-platform/webhooks/#issue-alerts) and [Metric Alert](/product/integrations/integration-platform/webhooks/#metric-alerts) webhook events with the specified settings for that service to further route the alert.

### Schema

```javascript
 {
    "type": "alert-rule-action",
    "title": <String>,
    "settings": {
        "type": "alert-rule-settings",
        "uri": <URI>,
        "required_fields": <Array<FormField>>,
        "optional_fields": <Array<FormField>>,
        "description": <String>
    }
}
```

### Attributes

- `title` - (Required) The title shown in the UI component.
- `uri` - (Required) Sentry will make a POST request to the URI when the User submits the form. If the services fails to process the request (status code >= 400), this component will bubble up the error to the User with the provided response text.
- `required_fields` - (Required) List of [FormField](/product/integrations/integration-platform/ui-components/formfield) components the User is required to complete.
- `optional_fields` - (Optional) List of [FormField](/product/integrations/integration-platform/ui-components/formfield) components the User may complete.
- `description` - (Optional) Text that will be displayed above the form. Limited to 140 characters.

### Example

```javascript

"elements": [
    {
        "type": "alert-rule-action",
        "title": "Send Alerts to",
        "settings": {
        "type": "alert-rule-settings",
        "uri": "/sentry/alert-rule",
            "required_fields": [
                {
                    "type": "text",
                    "label": "Channel",
                    "name": "channel"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
]

```

### Error Handling

When surfacing errors, we need to receive a JSON response with this shape:

```javascript
{message: string}
```

If data is not received as expected, nothing will be shown.
