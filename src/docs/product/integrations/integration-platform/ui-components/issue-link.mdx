With an issue linking UI component, the developer can connect Sentry issues with a task in their project management system. This functionality provides a way to use any project management tool the developer uses or develops.

The Issue Link component displays "Link &lt;Service&gt; Issue" in the Issue sidebar, which opens a modal allowing the user to create or link the issue to a task in the external service. For example, this is what our Shortcut integration looks like.

## Issue Link Schema

```javascript
{
    "type": "issue-link",
    "link": {
        "uri": <String>,
        "required_fields": <Array<FormField>>,
        "optional_fields": <Array<FormField>>
    },
    "create": {
        // Same as "link" schema
    }
}
```

### Attributes of the link and create fields

- `uri` - (Required) The URI to request when the User submits the Link/Create Issue form.
- `required_fields` - (Required) List of [FormField](/product/integrations/integration-platform/ui-components/formfield) components the User is required to complete.
- `optional_fields` - (Optional) List of [FormField](/product/integrations/integration-platform/ui-components/formfield) components the User may complete.


## Issue Link Request and Response

When a user attempts to create or link an issue, we will send a request to your service based on the provided `uri`.

### Request Format

We send a `POST` request, so all the information is stored in the body.

### Schema

```javascript
{
    "fields": <Object>,
    "installationId": <String>,
    "issueId": <String>,
    "webUrl": <String>,
    "project": {"slug": <String>, "id": <String>},
    "actor": {"type": "user", "name": <String>, "id": <String>},
}
```

### Attributes

- `fields` - Key/value pairs of the data in the form fields
- `installationId` - The ID of the installation associated with the request
- `issueId` - The ID of the issue in Sentry
- `webUrl` - The URL of the issue in Sentry
- `project`
  - `slug` - The slug of the project in Sentry
  - `id` - The ID of the project in Sentry
- `actor`
  - `name` - The name of the user in Sentry
  - `id` - The ID of user in Sentry

### Response Format

When creating or linking an issue, the response format _must_ have the following schema:

### Schema

```javascript
{
    "webUrl": <String>,
    "project": <String>,
    "identifier": <String>,
}
```

### Attributes

- `webUrl`- The URL of the linked issue in your project management system
- `project`- The first part of the displayed issue that should probably be associated with a project in your system
- `identifier`- The second part of the displayed issue that should be unique to the project

When an external issue is created or linked in Sentry, Sentry shows a display name that links back to the service where it was either created or linked. The display name is composed of two pieces: the `project` and the `identifier`. A hash (#) connects each piece. Here's an example of what it looks like in Sentry:

            "link": {
                "uri": "/sentry/issues/link",
                "required_fields": [
                    {
                        "type": "select",
                        "label": "Issue",
                        "name": "issue_id",
                        "uri": "/sentry/issues"
                    }
                ]
            },
            "create": {
                "uri": "/sentry/issues/create",
                "required_fields": [
                    {
                        "type": "text",
                        "label": "Title",
                        "name": "title"
                    }
                ],
                "optional_fields": [
                    {
                        "type": "select",
                        "label": "Owner",
                        "name": "owner",
                        "uri": "/sentry/members",
                        "async": true
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
