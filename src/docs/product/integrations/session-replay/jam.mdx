Jam helps you create the perfect bug report in two clicks. Built for speed, you can automatically capture an instant replay of the bug and all the dev logs engineers need to quickly identify the root cause, including console logs, network requests, device, and more.

The Jam Sentry integration gives you visibility of a bug from the frontend (captured with Jam) to all the services across your infrastructure that the bug traces across (captured with Sentry).

## Install and Configure

<Note>

Sentry owner or manager permissions are required to install this integration.
