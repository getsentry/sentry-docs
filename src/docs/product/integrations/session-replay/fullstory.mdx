<Alert level="warning">

If you make changes to your organization slug, you'll need to update your configuration for this integration. Learn more in our [troubleshooting guide](/product/integrations/troubleshooting).

</Alert>

The Sentry-FullStory integration seamlessly integrates the Sentry and FullStory platforms. When you look at a browser error in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io), you'll see a link to the FullStory session replay at that exact moment in time. In FullStory, replays in which your user experienced an error include a link that will take you to that error in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

You can find [installation instructions here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/fullstory).
