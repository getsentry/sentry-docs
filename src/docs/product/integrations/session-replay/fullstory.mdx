<Alert level="warning">

If you make changes to your organization slug, you will have to update your configuration on this integration. Find out more in the [troubleshooting guide](/product/integrations/troubleshooting).

</Alert>

The Sentry-FullStory integration seamlessly integrates the Sentry and FullStory platforms. When you look at a browser error in Sentry, you will see a link to the FullStory session replay at that exact moment in time. When you are watching a FullStory replay and your user experiences an error, you will see a link that will take you to that error in Sentry.

You can find [installation instructions here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/fullstory).
