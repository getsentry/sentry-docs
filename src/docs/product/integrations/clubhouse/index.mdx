Create a more efficient workflow by linking your Sentry Issues with your Clubhouse Stories. Errors, features, and anything else you track in Clubhouse can now live side by side. The new Clubhouse integration has feature parity with the Clubhouse plugin. If you're choosing between the two, we recommend installing the Clubhouse integration.

**Note:** This integration **won't** work with self-hosted Sentry.

#### Installation

1. In Sentry, navigate to Organization Settings > **Integrations**.

   ![Sentry's integrations page with Clubhouse at the top.](clubhouse_integration_2.png)

2. Find the Clubhouse Integration and click **Install**.
3. In the resulting modal, approve the permissions by clicking **Install**.

4. Your Clubhouse Integration is ready to use!

#### Configuration

##### Link an Issue

When linking an issue, you'll need either an existing Clubhouse Story or you'll need to create a Clubhouse Story.

###### Route 1: Clubhouse Story Exists

1. In Sentry, navigate to the specific **Issue** you want to link.
2. Click on **Link Clubhouse Issue** under **Linked Issues**.
