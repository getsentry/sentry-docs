ClickUpâ€™s core focus is about removing frustrations, inefficiencies, and disconnect caused by current project management solutions. You can create an issue in ClickUp from a Sentry issue or link it to an existing issue.

This integration is set up once per organization, and is then usable in all projects. It is maintained and supported by the company that created it. For more details, see [Integration Platform](product/integrations/integration-platform/).
