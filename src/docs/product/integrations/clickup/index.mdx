ClickUpâ€™s core focus is about removing frustrations, inefficiencies, and disconnect caused by current project management solutions. You can create an issue in ClickUp from a Sentry issue or link it to an existing issue.

This integration needs to set up only once per organization, then it is available for _all_ projects. It is maintained and supported by the company that created it. For more details, see [Integration Platform](/product/integrations/integration-platform/).
