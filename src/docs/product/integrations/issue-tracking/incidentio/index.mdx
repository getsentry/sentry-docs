The incident.io Sentry integration supports Sentry exceptions as incident attachments and can manage Sentry resources from within [incident.io](https://incident.io/).

This integration is maintained and supported by the company that created it. For more details, check out our [Integration Platform documentation](/product/integrations/integration-platform/).

## Install

<Note>

Sentry owner, manager, or admin permissions are required to install this integration.

Incident.io **won't** work with self-hosted Sentry.

</Note>

The preferred way to install the incident.io integration is by sharing a Sentry link in your active incident Slack channel, which prompts you to add the integration:

To add the incident.io integration in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io), navigate to **Settings > Integrations > incident.io** and click "Install":

## Issue Linking

Issue linking allows you to attach Sentry issues to existing incidents. Issue linking can be accomplished in Slack or within [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

### In Slack

To attach a Sentry issue to an incident in Slack, share a link to the Sentry issue and click "Yes, attach it" when prompted:

![Prompt to attach Sentry issue to incident in Slack](incidentio-attach-prompt.png)

The Sentry issue is now attached to the incident:

### In sentry.io

To attach a Sentry issue to an incident in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io), navigate to a specific Sentry issue and find the "Linked Issues" section on the right panel. Click "Link incident.io issue" and select your active incident from the dropdown:

## Issue Sync

The incident's Slack channel will be updated with attached Sentry issue comments, edited comments, and when the Sentry issue is resolved:
