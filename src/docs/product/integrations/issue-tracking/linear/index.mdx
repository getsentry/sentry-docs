Linear is an issue tracking tool built for speed, streamlining software projects, tasks, and bug tracking. Effortlessly create new Linear issues from Sentry and link Sentry issues to existing Linear issues.

This integration is maintained and supported by the company that created it. For more details, check out our [Integration Platform documentation](/product/integrations/integration-platform/).

## Issue Management

Issue tracking allows you to create Linear issues from within Sentry, and link Sentry issues to existing Linear issues. Issue management can be configured in two ways — automatically or manually.

### Automatically

To configure issue management automatically, create an [issue alert](/product/alerts/alert-types/#issue-alerts) or a [metric alert](/product/alerts/alert-types/#metric-alerts). When selecting the [action](/product/alerts/create-alerts/issue-alert-config/#then-conditions-actions), choose "Notify Integration" and then "Linear" for issue alerts, or select "Linear" from the action dropdown for metric alerts:

A Linear issue will be created automatically when the alert is triggered.

### Manually

To configure issue management manually, navigate to a specific Sentry issue and find the "Linked Issues" section on the right panel:

Here, you’ll be able to create or link Linear issues.
