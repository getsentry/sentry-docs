Height is designed to work for every type of team: no matter how you work, Height’s workflows are flexible enough to support you. From software engineering to marketing to business operations to design, every kind of team can track their projects and collaborate in one place.

Navigate through your tasks and update them lightning fast with our Command palette and customizable shortcuts. And best of all, with power user features hidden under the hood, Height is simple enough for anyone to get started, regardless of their project management experience.

Our Height Sentry integration allows your team to record and quickly resolve critical errors by linking new or existing Height tasks to Sentry issues. Linking tasks gives your teammates visibility into updates from Sentry, and can automatically mark Sentry issues as Resolved as the task status changes in Height. Additionally, set up custom alerts to create new Height tasks when key triggers you care about, like reported errors or session crashes, spike above a certain threshold.

Height needs to set up only once per organization, then it is available for _all_ projects. It is maintained and supported by the company that created it. For more details, see [Integration Platform](/product/integrations/integration-platform/).

## Install and Configure

<Note>

## Issue Management

Issue tracking allows you to create Height tasks from within Sentry, and link Sentry issues to existing Height tasks. Issue management can be configured in two ways&mdash;automatically or manually.

### Automatically

To configure issue management automatically, create an [issue alert](/product/alerts/alert-types/#issue-alerts) or a [metric alert](/product/alerts/alert-types/#metric-alerts). When selecting the [action](/product/alerts/create-alerts/issue-alert-config/#then-conditions-actions), choose "Notify Integration" and then "Height" for issue alerts, or select "Height" from the action dropdown for metric alerts.

A Height task will be created automatically when the alert is triggered.

### Manually

To configure issue management manually, navigate to a specific Sentry issue and find the "Linked Issues" section on the right hand panel.

Here, you’ll be able to create or link Height tasks.

## Issue Sync

Height will keep your issue statuses in sync. There is a default mapping from the Height task status to the Sentry issue status. If you resolve a Height task, the manually linked Sentry issue will also be resolved.
