Amazon SQS is useful for a more in-depth analysis of exceptions making it quick and easy to pipe exceptions back into your own systems. Or, use it to empower other teams, such as a Business Intelligence function.  

This integration is set up once per project, and is only usable in projects in which it has been set up. It is maintained and supported by the [Sentry community](https://forum.sentry.io/).
