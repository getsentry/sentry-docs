The PagerDuty integration allows you to connect your Sentry organization with one or more PagerDuty accounts, and start getting incidents triggered by Sentry alerts.

## Install

<Note>

Sentry owner, manager, or admin permissions are required to install this integration.

</Note>

1. Navigate to **Settings > Integrations > PagerDuty**

   ![Install PagerDuty integration](pagerduty-overview.png)

2. In the resulting modal, click "Add Installation".

3. You'll then be redirected to sign into PagerDuty and choose the account you'd like to connect to the current Sentry organization you are in.

4. After picking the account, you'll be prompted to add the PagerDuty services you want Sentry to send incidents to. Click "Connect" once you've added your services.

## Configure

The PagerDuty integration should now be installed. You'll be able to see the services connected by going to the **configure** page for your installation.

You can now set up rules to use the new integration under **Project Configuration** in the configure section of your installation.

If you re-generate an integration key for one of your services in PagerDuty you can manually update that value in configuration page for your PagerDuty installation. Additionally, you can add services by clicking "Add Services" in the top right. This will take you to the same page, as shown in step 5.

### Alert Rules

Click "Add Alert Rule" in the integration configuration page or go to **Alerts** and click "Create Alert" to set up a new alert rule for the PagerDuty integration.

In [issue alerts](/product/alerts/alert-types/#issue-alerts), select "Send a PagerDuty notification" in the actions dropdown and then select your account and service:

In [metric alerts](/product/alerts/alert-types/#metric-alerts), select the PagerDuty option in the dropdown that corresponds to your account and the select your service:

If a PagerDuty incident is created from the critical trigger of a metric alert, it will resolve itself when the Sentry metric alert is resolved.

## Deleting the Legacy PagerDuty Integration

Once you configure the global PagerDuty integration and Alert Rules, you can disable the old PagerDuty integration. Youâ€™ll need to go to each project that has it enabled and disable it. We recommend disabling the legacy integration after setting up the global integration.
