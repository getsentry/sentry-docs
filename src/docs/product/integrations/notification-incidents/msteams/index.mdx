Microsoft Teams is a hub for teamwork in Office 365. Keep all your team's chats, meetings, files, and apps together in one place. Get alerts that let you assign, ignore, and resolve issues right in your Teams channels with the Sentry integration for Microsoft Teams.

Set this integration up once per organization, then it's available for _all_ projects.

## Install

<Note>

Sentry owner, manager, or admin permissions are required to install this integration.

The integration should be installed at this point.

## Configure

Use Microsoft Teams for [alerts](/product/alerts/) regarding issues, environments, deployment, etc.

### Alert Rules

Set up an alert rule by going to **Alerts** and clicking "Create Alert\*". From here, you can configure alerts to route notifications to your Microsoft Team's channels.

In [issue alerts](/product/alerts/alert-types/#issue-alerts), select "Send a Microsoft Teams notification" in the actions dropdown and then select your team and channel:

In [metric alerts](/product/alerts/alert-types/#metric-alerts), select the Microsoft Teams option in the dropdown that corresponds to your team and then enter the username or channel:

Once you receive a Microsoft Teams notification, you can use the "Resolve", "Ignore", or "Assign" buttons to update the Issue in Sentry.

The first time you try to interact with a notification, you will get a message from the Sentry bot asking you to link your identity. Click "Link Identities" to complete this step. Until you do this, you can't interact with messages.
