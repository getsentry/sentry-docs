---

The Opsgenie integration allows you to connect your Sentry organization with one or more Opsgenie accounts. Once your accounts have been connected, you'll be able to configure issue and metric alerts in Sentry to be sent to the Opsgenie teams of your choice.

## Install

<Note>

You'll need Sentry owner, manager, or admin-level permissions to be able to install this integration.

</Note>

1. To get started, go to **Settings > Integrations > Opsgenie (Integration)** and click "Add Installation".

2. Select your base Opsgenie URL and type in your Opsgenie account name. If you like, you can also add your integration key at this time. After you click 'Submit', you'll be directed to the configuration page for your connected Opsgenie integration.

## Configure

The Opsgenie integration should now be installed. Go to the configuration page to manually add and update integration keys. (Keys have to be associated with a 'Sentry' integration in Opsgenie.)

If you added an integration key during installation, it'll appear on the configuration page with the label 'my-first-key'. You can change this label at any time.

### Set Up Alerts

You can set up a new alert rule via the Opsgenie integration configuration page by clicking on the **Add Alert Rule** button in the **Project Configuration** section, or by going to the **Alerts** page in Sentry.

To create an [issue alert](/product/alerts/alert-types/#issue-alerts) in Sentry, go to the **Alerts** page and click "Create Alert". After you've decided what you want to be alerted about, you'll be able to choose to "Send an Opsgenie notification" from the "Add action" dropdown. You can then choose your account and team:

If you'd rather be alerted when a specific metric crosses a threshold, you can set a [metric alert](/product/alerts/alert-types/#metric-alerts) by following the same steps as above. Once you've chosen the metric you want to be alerted about, click "Add Action", then select Opsgenie from the notification types dropdown.

Alerts that get resolved in Sentry will be automatically acknowledged in Opsgenie.
