Triage, resolve, and ignore Sentry issues directly from Slack.

This integration needs to set up only once per organization, then it is available for _all_ projects.

## Install

<Note>

Sentry owner or manager permissions are required to install this integration.

</Note>

Slack defaults to let any workspace member authorize apps, but they may have to request access. See this [Slack help article](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202035138-Add-an-app-to-your-workspace) for more details.

1.  In Sentry, navigate to **Settings > Integrations**.

1.  When you enter the page, the integrations list displays, which includes Slack. Use the search bar to filter quickly for the Slack integration.
    Click "Slack" to navigate to the details page for this integration.

Your Slack integration is now available to all projects in your Sentry organization. To enable Slack notification for private channels, add the Slack app to the channel. One quick method: use `@sentry` to invite the Sentry bot the Slack channel.

In the next section, we'll walk you through configuring your notification settings.

## Configure

Use Slack for notifications and [alerts](#alert-rules) regarding issues, environments, deployment, etc.

### Personal Notifications

You can receive personal workflow, deploy, and issue alert notifications from our Slack integration. Manage your [personal notification settings](/product/alerts/notifications/notification-settings/) by navigating to **User Settings > Notifications**.

#### Linking Your Slack and Sentry Accounts

In order to receive personal notifications from our Slack integration, your Slack identity must be linked with your Sentry account. This can be done by typing `/sentry link` in Slack.

### Team Notifications

You can receive [team alert notifications](/product/alerts/create-alerts/issue-alert-config/#then-conditions-actions) from our Slack integration. To enable this feature, type `/sentry link team` in the desired Slack channel. To view a team's associated Slack channel in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io), navigate to **Settings > Teams > [Team] > Notifications**.

### Alert Rules

1. Confirm your Slack workspace is configured globally for your Sentry organization by navigating to Organization Settings > **Integrations**. Click on "Configuration(s)" to go to the configuration details page.

1. Click "Add Alert Rule" for this project to navigate to Alert Rule settings.

   You can also access **Alerts** from your **Project Settings**. From here, you can configure when notifications are sent to your Slack workspace(s).

   You can route notifications in a few ways: to a specific channel in your Slack workspace, to multiple channels in your Slack workspace, or to multiple Slack workspaces.

1. Click "New Alert Rule" to configure a new Alert.

   Update the Slack channel routing by for existing Alert Rules by choosing Slack as the action under **Perform these actions**:

   After selecting **Send a Slack notification**, specify the workspace, channel(s), and tags you’d like to include with your Alert Rule.

   ![](slack-alert-rule-edit-channels.png)

   You can add Alert Rules routing to as many Slack channels as you’d like.

1. Then once you receive a Slack notification, you can use the Resolve, Ignore, or Assign buttons to update the Issue in Sentry.

### Troubleshooting

#### Rate Limiting Error

If you're attempting to save a Slack alert rule and are receiving the following error: "Requests to slack were rate limited. Please try again later.", you may enter in the channel or user ID in addition to the channel name.

## Deleting the legacy project-based Slack integration

We recommend disabling the legacy project-based integration after setting up the global integration.

Once you configure the global Slack integration and alert rules, you can disable the old project-based Slack integration. Go to each project that has the old project-based Slack enabled and disable it.
