The Split integration quickly processes and displays Sentry exception data in the Split platform as track events for analysis. You can control what environments and traffic types you're capturing exceptions for in the Split dashboard without having to touch any code.

This integration needs to set up only once per organization, then it is available for _all_ projects. It is maintained and supported by the company that created it. For more details, see [Integration Platform](/product/integrations/integration-platform/).

## Install and Configure
