The Split integration quickly processes and displays Sentry exception data in the Split platform as track events for analysis. You can control what environments and traffic types you're capturing exceptions for in the Split dashboard without having to touch any code.

The Split integration is only available for organizations on the Business and Enterprise plans.

**Note:** This integration **won't** work with self-hosted Sentry.
