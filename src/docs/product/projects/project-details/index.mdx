<Note>

This feature is available only if you're in the Early Adopter program. Features available to Early Adopters are still in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.

If you’re interested in being an Early Adopter, you can turn your organization’s Early Adopter status on/off in General Settings. This will affect all users in your organization and can be turned back off just as easily.

</Note>

The **Project Details** page provides a consolidated view of what's going on in your project. This page is useful if you have oversight over many teams and many projects. You can also use this page to set up [Alerting](/product/alerts-notifications/) or delve into the Issue stream to [triage an issue](#triage).

After selecting the time range (the default is the last 14 days), the top three cards display:

- Crash free [sessions](/product/releases/health/#session)
- Number of [releases](/product/releases/)
- [Apdex](/product/performance/metrics/#apdex)

Select one of the predefined time ranges (excluding `Last 90 days`) to view the change in these numbers since the last period.

In the two graphs below the cards you can view:

- Crash free [sessions](/product/releases/health/#session)
- [Apdex](/product/performance/metrics/#apdex)
- [Failure rate](/product/performance/metrics/#failure-rate)
- [Transactions per minute](/product/performance/metrics/#throughput-total-tpm-tps)
- Daily errors
- Daily transactions

Toggle the **Display** to change the view. You can click on the graph legend to show/hide overlay of releases and previous period.

## Alerting

You can use the Project Details page to access Sentry's alerting feature. Click the **Create Alert** button at the top right to set up either an [Issue Alert](/product/alerts-notifications/issue-alerts/) or a [Metric Alert](/product/alerts-notifications/metric-alerts/). In the **Latest Alerts** section of the sidebar you can see the three latest triggered alerts. Click on one of them to go to Alert Details page. The selected time range does not affect the displayed alerts.

## Releases

You can use the Project Details page to assess how often you release new versions of your application. See how many releases you did compared to the previous period in the top card, see the release lines overlayed on top of graphs and see the latest five releases in the **Latest Releases** section of the sidebar. You can click one of them to navigate to Release Details page. The selected time range does not affect the displayed releases.

## Triage

Use Project Details to view issues associated with this project, accessing the **Issue Details** page to triage the issue by either clicking **View All Issues** or the **Open in Issues** button located at the top of the **Frequent Issues** listed on the page. The issues in the table are sorted by the number of events in the selected time range.

## Modify Project Settings

Use the Settings icon at the top of the page to access the Project's Settings; modify as appropriate to your team and organization.
