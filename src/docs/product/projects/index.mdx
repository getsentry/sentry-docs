A _Project_ represents your service or application in Sentry. For example, you might have separate projects for your API server and frontend client.

You can create a project for a service and select the particular language or framework when you first start using Sentry. You can add more projects on an as-needed basis, for example, if you want to manage access permissions and/or control privacy and data settings. Setting up multiple projects to reflect your application landscape with finer granularity will go a long way in helping with visibility and triage.

When displaying the **Issue Stream** and **Discover** views, the top-level filter bar considers the projects you are a member of by default. This way, you are looking at information that is immediately relevant to your work.

Projects differ from [environments](/product/sentry-basics/environments/), which are designed to help triage issues, especially in a multi-staged release process.

## Projects Homepage

The project homepage lists the projects by teams of which you're a member, providing a high-level overview:

- A snapshot of both errors and transactions
- The team and team members associated with each project (remember, projects can be associated to multiple teams, so a project may be listed more than once)
- The percentage of crash free sessions (if you have configured [Release Health](/product/releases/health/))
- Deploys, if you have configured your SDK to [provide a release identifier](/platform-redirect/?next=/configuration/releases/) and are tracking [deploys](/product/cli/releases/#creating-deploys)

The projects are displayed in alphabetical order, separated by team. **Note:** For faster access, star your favorites to ensure they display at the top of the page each time you view.

## View Project Details

The [Project Details](/product/projects/project-details/) page provides an overview over errors, performance, and the health of your releases. You can use the page to quickly correlate spikes in error rates with the issues causing them, react to critical alerts, and analyze long-term trends.

Open Project Details by clicking the title of the project on the Projects page.
