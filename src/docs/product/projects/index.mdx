<Note>

This feature is available only if you're in the Early Adopter program. Features available to Early Adopters are still in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.

If you’re interested in being an Early Adopter, you can turn your organization’s Early Adopter status on/off in General Settings. This will affect all users in your organization and can be turned back off just as easily.

</Note>

A _Project_ represents a service or application. For example, you might have separate projects for your API server and frontend client.

You can create a project for a service and select the particular language or framework when you first start using Sentry. You can add more projects on an as-needed basis. For example, if you want to manage access permissions and/or control privacy and data settings. Setting up multiple projects to reflect your application landscape with finer granularity will go a long way in helping with visibility and triage.

When displaying the **Issue Stream** and **Discover** views, the top-level filter bar considers the projects you are a member of by default. This way, you are looking at information that is immediately relevant to your work.

Projects differ from [environments](/product/sentry-basics/environments/), which are designed to help triage issues, especially in a multi-staged release process.

## Project Homepage

The project homepage lists the projects by teams of which you're a member, providing a high-level overview:

- A snapshot of both errors and transactions
- The team and team members associated with each project (remember, projects can be associated to multiple teams, so a project may be listed more than once)
- Deploys, if you have configured your SDK to [provide a release identifier](/platform-redirect/?next=/configuration/releases/) and are tracking [deploys](/product/cli/releases/#creating-deploys)

The projects are displayed in alphabetical order, separated by team. **Note:** For faster access, star your favorites to ensure they display at the top of the page each time you view.

## View Project Details

Project details combine errors, performance, and health in one central place. The [Project Details](/product/projects/project-details/) page provides a critical overview to developers, product owners, and engineering managers to answer the central question of "What is the project's current state and where do I need to look next?".

Open Project Details by clicking the title of the project on the Projects page.
