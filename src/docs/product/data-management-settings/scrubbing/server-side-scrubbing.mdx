If you cannot - or do not want to - <PlatformLink to="/data-management/sensitive-data/">scrub data within the SDK</PlatformLink>, Sentry provides a number of options to achieve this in the product itself. You'll find these settings under the **Data Scrubber** option within both your Organization and individual Project settings. By default this is enabled, and we highly recommend you keep it that way.

With it enabled, Sentry will scrub the following:

- Values that look like they contain credit cards (using a basic regular expression)
- Values that themselves contain, or whose keynames contain, any of the following strings:
  - password
  - secret
  - passwd
  - api_key
  - apikey
  - access_token
  - auth
  - credentials
  - mysql_pwd
  - stripetoken
  - card[number]
  - github_token
  - privatekey
  - private_key
- Values that contain strings in, or whose keynames are listed in, [Project] > Settings > Security & Privacy in "Additional Sensitive Fields".
  - An entry in "Additional Sensitive Fields" such as `mysekret`, for example, will cause the removal of any field named `mysekret`, but also removes any field _value_ that contains `mysekret`. Sentry does this to protect against sensitive data leaking as part of structured data that has been sent as a single string to Sentry (such as, a JSON object that is stringified and embedded as JSON string in another JSON structure).
  - As an extreme example where this behavior can become surprising, the string `"Unexpected error"` will be removed from events if the entry `exp` is in "Additional Sensitive Fields".

Sentry will redact arrays and literal values, but also entire objects. For example:

```javascript
credentials = {
  username: 'jane',
  cats: ['pancake', 'maple', 'hellboy']
  password: 'p4ssw0rd!',
  lastLogin: 'yesterday',
  ...
}
```

Using the default options will cause the _object_ `credentials` to be set to `null`, and the object itself will not be entered. To prevent this from happening add the keyname to Safe Fields (`credentials` in this case). This will leave the `credentials` object intact, while making all of its entries subject to scrubbing.
So `password` will be redacted by default, and adding `cats`, `username`, and/or `lastLogin` to the list of additional fields will cause those values to be redacted as well.

<Note>

You can choose to expand the keys that are scrubbed by the server, as well as prevent IP addresses from being stored. The latter is particularly important if you’re concerned about PII and using our Browser JavaScript SDK.

</Note>

In addition, we provide an [_Advanced Data Scrubbing_](/product/data-management-settings/scrubbing/advanced-datascrubbing/) feature that allows more control over how filters are applied.

## Removing Data

If you’ve accidentally sent sensitive data to the server, you likely don't to want to leave it there. There are a few things to note in removal:

- If you send the data as a tagged value, removing the event is not enough. Visit your **Project Settings > Tags** to permanently remove any related data for a given tag.
- While you cannot delete a single event, you can delete the issue the event is in by clicking the trash icon on the **Issue Details** page.
- If a large number of unique events - representing multiple issues - contain the data, you may need to delete and re-create the project to effectively cleanse the system.

## Known Limitations

It's not currently possible to avoid scrubbing data in [breadcrumbs](/product/issues/issue-details/breadcrumbs/) by adding the category name in "Safe Fields". Only the message and data in breadcrumbs are used for data scrubbing. Also, if custom JSON data is provided, the fields will be scrubbed according to the configured rules and the entries in "Safe Fields".
