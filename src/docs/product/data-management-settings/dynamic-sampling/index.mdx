description: "Learn about Sentry dynamically prioritizes your transaction data."
---

Capturing a single [trace](/product/sentry-basics/tracing/distributed-tracing/) — which consists of one or more transactions — involves minimal overhead, but capturing traces for every page load or every API request might overload your system. Sentry automatically prioritizes your transactions, server-side, so that we can provide you with the most valuable insights about your application’s performance while also applying helpful prioritization to the data we retain for you.

By default, we prioritize transaction data in the following ways:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

| Prioritize | Ignore |
|------------|--------|
| Latest release | Health checks |
| Dev environments | |

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

We prioritize data from development environments because these environments typically generate a relatively small number of transactions compared to your production environments. As a result, to gain meaningful insights during your testing phase, we prioritize transaction data from these environments.

_Health check_ type transactions, while important for checking the stability of your application, don't have any value for you beyond the task associated with them. They also tend to be high in volume, potentially using up a lot of you quota if retained. To avoid using up your volume on this type of transactions, we ignore these when sampling your data.

While we do our best to provide you with the most useful transaction data, our **Dynamic Sampling** feature allows you to turn the priorities that we apply to your data retention on or off:

Because every project is different, you can set these toggles differently for different projects. For example, you may have a project where retaining transactions from the latest release is not a priority for you.

By default, these toggles are all enabled so that Sentry's dynamic sampling priorities are applied to your data.

## Server-side Controls & Client-side Sampling

Dynamic sampling also makes your SDK (client-side) and your server-side configuration largely independent of each other. This helps if you're building native applications with many active releases at a given time.

Our dynamic sampling works best when you send us as much data as you can (ideally 100% but we'll take what you can give us). As you purchase more transaction volume, however, your pricing does down accordingly and you see significant savings. If we don't think we're able to provide you with high-quality data because your client-side sampling rate is too low, we'll let you know.

## Traces & Propagation of Sampling Decisions

When Sentry makes sampling decisions, we do so for entire traces. Instead of looking at a particular transaction, we look at the entire group of transactions in a trace. Sampling transactions using transaction traces is ideal because it allows you to understand transactions in the context of your whole system.

Since we sample traces, sampling rules are based on the trace context. This means that sampling decisions are based on the information extracted from the _system that initiated the transaction_. The head transaction in a trace determines the trace context for all following transactions in that trace. No information can be changed, added, or deleted after the first propagation. The trace context is bound to only one particular trace, and all the transactions that are part of this trace.
