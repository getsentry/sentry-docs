<Note>

To set up or configure dynamic sampling, you need to be an Owner, Manager, or Admin of your Sentry organization.

</Note>

Once you understand [how Sentry samples](/product/sentry-basics/sampling/dsla/), you can set server-side sampling rules in **[Project] > Settings > Dynamic Sampling**. Below, we explain how rules are evaluated and provide examples of good and bad configurations.

## Order of Precedence

Rules evaluate from top to bottom, with the first matching rule determining the sample rate. Like with declaring a conditional statement in code, rules with the most specific conditional clauses should be evaluated first (`If`), followed by more generic ones (`Else If`). If generic rules lead the list, the more specific rules will likely never be evaluated. Setting a uniform server-side sampling rate is equivalent to an `Else` clause which will always trail rules with conditional clauses.

You can change the order of your rules on the **Dynamic Sampling** page in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) to make them more effective.

<Note>

The following examples are illustrated as code samples, but you'll configure these rules using the **Dynamic Sampling** page interface.

</Note>

## Good Examples

**Most specific rule leads the list**

The rule with the most specific conditional clause will always be evaluated because it's first in order:

```
if (release = 3.0) && (environment = production) {
    transactionSample = 1.0
} else if (environment = production) {
    transactionSample = 0.5
} else {
    transactionSample = 0.25
}
```

**Each rule is evaluated independently**

This configuration also works because each rule will be evaluated based on entirely different conditions:

```
if (release = 3.0) {
    transactionSample = 1.0
} else if (environment = production) {
    transactionSample = 0.5
} else {
    transactionSample = 0.25
}
```

## Poor Example

The rule with the most specific conditional clause will never be evaluated because a rule with a similar, but more generic clause precedes it:

```
if (environment = production) {
    transactionSample = 1.0
} else if (release = 3.0) && (environment = production) {
    transactionSample = 0.5 // Will never be evaluated
} else {
    transactionSample = 0.25
}
```
