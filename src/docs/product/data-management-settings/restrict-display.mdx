It’s common that compliance within your company may mean that data can only be transmitted over SSL and securely stored. One area where this often comes up is with email notifications.

## Confidential Information in Alerts

By default, Sentry will send a large amount of data as part of the issue notification. In some cases, this data may be source code or other user data.

If you need to control this, you can enable the **Enhanced Privacy** setting for your organization. To do so, visit your organization’s dashboard, click **Settings**, and then tick the option to enable enhanced privacy.

Once you've enabled this setting, parts of the system, primarily email notifications, will immediately reflect the change and begin restricting data to only basic attributes, such as the issue title and description.
