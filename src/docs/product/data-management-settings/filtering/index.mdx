Sentry provides several methods to filter data in your project. Using sentry.io to filter events is a simple method since you don't have to <PlatformLink to="/configuration/filtering/">configure and deploy your SDK to filter projects</PlatformLink>.

## Inbound Data Filters

Inbound data filters allow you to determine which errors, if any, Sentry should ignore. Explore these by navigating toÂ **[Project] > Project Settings > Inbound Filters.**

These filters are exclusively applied at ingest time and not later in processing. This, for instance, lets you discard an error by error message when the error is ingested through the JSON API. On the other hand, this filter doesn't apply to ingested minidumps. Filtered events do not consume quota, as discussed in [What Counts Toward My Quota](/product/accounts/quotas/#what-counts-toward-my-quota-an-overview).

Inbound filters include:

- Common browser extension errors
- Events coming from localhost
- Known legacy browsers errors
- Known web crawlers
- By their error message
- From specific release versions of your code
- From certain IP addresses

<Note>

Filters do not apply to [sessions](/product/releases/health/#session). Error messages from minidumps also do not yet apply.

Once applied, you can track the filtered events (numbers and cause) using the graph provided at the top of the Inbound Data Filters view.

## How Inbound Filters Work

Inbound data filters are not case sensitive.

### Filtering by Error Message

To use inbound data filters for error messages, keep the following in mind:

- The filter matches the entire error description. For example, to match "ConnectionError", use the filter `*ConnectionError*`. Because filters are not case sensitive, `*connectionerror*` is fine, too.
- Square brackets (`[` and `]`) have a special meaning due to the way our globs are evaluated. To match a square bracket, escape it as in this example: `*please try again \[not found\]*`.
- Exceptions with an exception title (usually the class name) and description are joined with a colon, which is the the same as it is in the terminal. We don't recommend this type of matching, however, and suggest you match with wildcards instead. For example: Exception title "ConnectionError" and description "Max retries exceeded" will join to a literal "ConnectionError: Max retries exceeded" for filter evaluation.
