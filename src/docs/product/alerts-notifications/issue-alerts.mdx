title: Issue Alerts
sidebar_order: 2
---

Issue alerts apply only to event errors, and trigger whenever any issue in the project matches the specified criteria, such as a resolved issue re-appearing or an issue affecting many users. Sentry users with admin permissions or higher can create alerts. To confirm or set admin permissions, navigate to **Project Settings > Alerts > New Alert**. To change the frequency of your alerts, configure your [Alert Settings](/product/alerts-notifications/alert-settings/).

## Conditions

Conditions are evaluated for an issue alert **each time** the issue receives a new event, subject to [rate limits](/product/alerts-notifications/alerts/#rate-limit). Each condition is **evaluated independently** of other conditions. For example, the following alert will never trigger:

![The alert condition in this example shows the conditions are conflicting with each other.](alert-conditions2.png)

In the example, the alert will not fire because an event **cannot satisfy both** of these conditions simultaneously: Sentry detects/creates a new issue, _and_ the issue has happened ten times.

Types of alert conditions:

| Type | Condition |
| -- | -- |
| Issue detection | Sentry detects a new issue |
| Issue creation | Sentry creates an issue |
| Issue changes state | `resolved` to `unresolved` |
| Issue changes state | `ignored` to `unresolved` |
| Issue changes frequency | An issue has happened more than {**value**} times in {**interval**}. A **value** is a positive integer. An **integer** can be one minute, one hour, one day, one week, or 30 days |
| Issue visible to users | An issue has been seen by more than {**value**} users in {**interval**}. A **value** is a positive integer. An **interval** is one minute, one hour, one day, one week, or 30 days. |
| New event detection | Sentry detects a new event |
| New event detection | Sentry detects a new event with tags matching {**key**} {**match**} {**value**}. A **key**: any tag. A **match**: equals, does not equal, starts with, ends with, contains, does not contain, is set, or is not set. A **value**: any key’s value |
| New event detection | Sentry detects a new event with {**attribute**} {**match**} {**value**}. An **attribute**: `message`, `platform`, `environment`, `type`, `exception.type`, `exception.value`, `user.id`, `user.email`, `user.username`, `user.ip_address`, `http.method`, `http.url`, `stacktrace.code`, `stacktrace.module`, or `stacktrace.filename`. A **match**: equals, does not equal, starts with, ends with, contains, does not contain, is set, or is not set. A **value**: any attribute’s value. NOTE: When viewing an event, if an attribute is unclear or missing, you can view its JSON payload to determine its value. |
| New event detection | Sentry detects a new event with level {**match**} {**level**}. A **match**: equal to, less than or equal to, greater than or equal to. A **level**: fatal, error, warning, info, debug, or sample. |

## Actions

Actions are the configurations that determine what will happen when an alert is triggered. The following actions are available:

- Send an email to either [Issue Owners](/product/error-monitoring/issue-owners/), Team, or [Member](/accounts/membership/#member).
- Send a notification to an [integration](/product/integrations/), which includes [PagerDuty](/product/integrations/integrations/pagerduty/), [Slack](/product/integrations/integrations/slack/), and [Microsoft Teams](/product/integrations/integrations/msteams/). If no legacy integrations or integrations built using the integration platform are enabled, this option is hidden.

## Rate Limit

The rate limit determines how frequently an issue alerts. After an issue triggers an alert, Sentry won't check the conditions and won't execute the actions for that issue until the rate limit period passes. The limit is set to perform the action according to one of these intervals:

- minutes: 5, 10, 30, 60
- hours: 3, 12, 24
- one week or 30 days

For example, if an issue violates alert conditions multiple times in a 30-min period, but your frequency threshold is 30 minutes, you’ll only get one alert.

## Environment

Environment control allows you to specify which environment qualifies for your issue alert:

- All Environments
- Any of your defined (and not hidden) environments.

If you select "All Environments", Sentry checks individually for each environment, rather than combined events across environments.

## Digests

The digests feature works only for **issue alert emails** and limits alerts across projects. This project-level setting allows you to batch issue alerts to limit the total number of emails you receive for that project. Use the sliders to control the frequency.

## Issue Owners

By default, [issue owners](/product/error-monitoring/issue-owners/) receive alert emails. If an issue owner is not configured or not found, the email will either not send or send to all project members as defined in **Project Settings > Issue Owners**.

## Ignore

When an issue is set to ignore, Sentry mutes the alerts for that issue. You can also ignore an issue until certain conditions are met. For example, "ignore for 30 minutes." Keep in mind; an ignored issue **will still count towards your quota**.
