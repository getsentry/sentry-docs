## Alerts

- What is the difference between Delete, Delete & Discard, and Ignore?
  - Delete - Deleting an issue deletes all data associated with it, and creates a new issue if an event with the same fingerprint happens again. Alerts and workflow notifications for this new issue behave just like notifications for any new issue.
  - Delete & Discard - when you delete and discard an issue, all notifications for the issue will stop
  - Ignore - While an issue is ignored, all alerts for that issue are muted. You can also ignore an issue until certain conditions are met. For example, "ignore for 30 minutes." Keep in mind; an ignored issue **will still count towards your quota.**
- Can I copy an alert rule to another project?
  - This feature will be available in a future release.

## Notifications

- Does assigning a resolved issue trigger a notification email?
  - Yes, you do get an email as long as you have workflow notifications enabled for that project.
- What is a regression?
  - If another event is seen in the issue, the issue will revert to unresolved, which often identifies a regression.
