Configure alerts to your team's needs with alert rules and settings. Create new alerts, view alerts, and designate the recipient(s) of each alert.

## Rules

Alert Rules shows all of your project's alerts, their type, name, triggers, and actions. Use this page to create new alerts, determine if a component of your project needs alerting, or recognize unnecessary alerts.

## Settings

Alerts have default settings and options to customize alerts to your personal needs.

### Personal Alert Settings

Review your personal alert settings in **User Settings > Account > Notifications**. Use the "default project alerts" setting to set your default preference across all projects; subscribed or unsubscribed. Note: this setting does not affect alerts you've configured to send to your email explicitly.

After selecting the appropriate alert setting, selectively change it by project in **User Settings > Account > Fine tune alerts by project**. Each project has three options: Default, On, or Off. Selecting default uses your default preference from the previous step.
