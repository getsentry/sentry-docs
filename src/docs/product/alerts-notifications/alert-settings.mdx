Configure alerts to your team's needs with alert rules and settings. Create new alerts, view alerts, and designate the recipient(s) of each alert.

## Rules

The “Alert Rules” tab displays your alert rules, along with their current status, project, team, and creation date. By default, the list is filtered so that only alerts associated with the teams you're a member of, as well as ones that aren't associated with any team, are displayed. You can change this using the filter button.

The **Alerts** page also displays a “History” tab where you can find a list of [metric alerts](/product/alerts-notifications/metric-alerts/), along with visual graphs, associated projects, and the last time the alert was triggered. In the “History” tab, the default view displays unresolved metric alerts.

## Settings

You can customize the settings for an alert, as well as your own personal alert settings.

### Alert Settings

With alert settings, you can configure alert email templates and set minimum and maximum delivery intervals for alerts. Access alert settings by navigating to **[Project] > Settings > Alerts**.

#### Digests

The digests feature works only for **issue alert emails** and limits alerts across issues within a project. This project-level setting allows you to batch issue alerts to limit the total number of emails sent for that project. Use the sliders to control the frequency.

### Personal Alert Settings

Review your personal alert settings in **User Settings > Account > Notifications**. Use the "default project alerts" setting to set your default preference across all projects; subscribed or unsubscribed. Note: this setting does not affect alerts you've configured to send to your email explicitly.

After selecting the appropriate alert setting, selectively change it by project in **User Settings > Account > Fine tune alerts by project**. Each project has three options: Default, On, or Off. Selecting default uses your default preference from the previous step.
