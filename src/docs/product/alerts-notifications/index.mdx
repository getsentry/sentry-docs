Alerts and notifications are customizable to your organization's needs with options to pair with [integrations](/product/integrations/), flexible configurations, and choices for both [error](#error-alerting) or [performance](#performance-alerting) alerting. Conversely, you can keep alerts and notifications as they are with Sentry's default settings. Alerts and notifications show the impact of errors on your users, help uncover the error type, and monitor your application's performance.

## Issue Alerts for Errors

Issue alerting sets alerts on changes within grouped error events, or _issues_. Create alerts for issues such as:

- Issues affecting many users
- [Event](/platforms/javascript/enriching-events/) frequency
- Reoccuring events with specific [tags](/platforms/javascript/enriching-events/tags/)

To change the frequency of your alerts, configure your [Alert Subscription](/product/alerts-notifications/alert-subscription/).

## Metric Alerts for Errors & Performance

[Metric alerting](/product/alerts-notifications/alerts/#metric-alerts) monitors macro-level [metrics](/product/performance/metrics/) for both error events and transaction events. A metric alert is triggered when a [threshold](/product/performance/metrics/#p50-threshold) is breached. You can set the threshold for metrics using the value of an aggregate function like `count()` or `avg()` to see how errors are impacting your user's experience, the [performance](/product/performance/) speed of your application, and more.

You can filter events by [attributes](/platforms/python/usage/#optional-attributes) and [tags](/platforms/javascript/enriching-events/tags/), which is particularly useful for aggregating across events that aren't grouped into single issues. Use alerts for metrics such as:

- [Latency](/product/performance/metrics/#latency): min, max, average, percentile
- [Apdex](/product/performance/metrics/#apdex)
- [Failure rate](/product/performance/metrics/#failure-rate)
- [Transaction volume](/product/performance/metrics/#frequency)

To change the frequency of your alerts, configure your [Alert Subscription](/product/alerts-notifications/alert-subscription/).

## Notifications

[Notifications](/product/alerts-notifications/notifications/) are emails triggered by changes in [issue state](/product/alerts-notifications/notifications/#issue-states), [releases](/product/releases/), and [quota usage](/accounts/quotas/). To change the frequency of your email notifications, configure your [Notification Subscription](/product/alerts-notifications/notifications/#notification-subscription).

Types of Sentry notifications:

- [**Workflow notifications**](/product/alerts-notifications/notifications/#workflow): Activity involving user actions and state changes on issues. Includes activities such as resolution, assignment, comments, and regressions.

- [**Deploy notifications**](/product/alerts-notifications/notifications/#deploy): When a release is deployed, Sentry automatically sends an email to users who have committed to the release.

- [**Quota & Usage notifications**](/product/alerts-notifications/notifications/#quota): Emails about approaching quotas, exceeded quotas, and spike protection.
