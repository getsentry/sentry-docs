Alerts notify you about errors and performance problems in your application. Notifications send emails for situations like an issue state change or if a release has deployed. Alerts and notifications are customizable to your organization's needs with options to pair with [integrations](/product/integrations/), flexible configurations, and choices for both error or performance alerting. Default settings for notifications are also available.

## Issue Alerts for Errors

Issue alerting sets alerts on changes within grouped error events, or _issues_. Issues are grouped automatically by Sentry based on stack trace and other factors. Create alerts for issue-level changes, such as:

- New issues
- Issue frequency increasing
- Resolved and ignored issues getting unresolved

To change the frequency of your alerts, configure your [Alert Settings](/product/alerts-notifications/alert-settings/).

## Metric Alerts for Errors & Performance

[Metric alerts](/product/alerts-notifications/alerts/#metric-alerts) monitor macro-level [metrics](/product/performance/metrics/) for both error events and transaction events. A metric takes a set of events and computes an aggregate value using a function such as `count()` or `avg()` applied to the event properties over a period of time. Metric alerting is triggered when a [threshold](/product/performance/metrics/#p50-threshold) is breached. You can set the threshold for metrics using the value of an aggregate function to see how errors are impacting your user's experience, the [performance](/product/performance/) speed of your application, and more.

You can filter events by [attributes](/platforms/python/usage/#optional-attributes) and [tags](/platforms/javascript/enriching-events/tags/), which is particularly useful for aggregating across events that aren't grouped into single issues. Use metric alerts for alerting on:

- New issues
- Resolved and ignored issues getting unresolved
- [Latency](/product/performance/metrics/#latency): min, max, average, percentile
- [Failure rate](/product/performance/metrics/#failure-rate)
- Custom metrics

To change the frequency of your alerts, configure your [Alert Settings](/product/alerts-notifications/alert-settings/).

## Notifications

[Notifications](/product/alerts-notifications/notifications/) are emails triggered by changes in [issue state](/product/alerts-notifications/notifications/#issue-states), [releases](/product/releases/), and [quota usage](/product/accounts/quotas/). To change the frequency of your email notifications, configure your personal [Notification Settings](/product/alerts-notifications/notifications/#notification-settings).

Types of Sentry notifications:

- [**Workflow notifications**](/product/alerts-notifications/notifications/#workflow): Activity involving user actions and state changes on issues. Includes activities such as resolution, assignment, comments, and regressions.

- [**Deploy notifications**](/product/alerts-notifications/notifications/#deploy): When a release is deployed, Sentry automatically sends an email to users who have committed to the release.

- [**Quota & Usage notifications**](/product/alerts-notifications/notifications/#quota): Emails about approaching quotas, exceeded quotas, and spike protection.
