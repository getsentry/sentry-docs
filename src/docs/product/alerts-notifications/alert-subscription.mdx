MIMI NOTE: add a section to Alert Settings

Configure alert rules to your team's needs with alert rules and subscription. Create new alerts, view alerts, and designate the recipient(s) of each alert.

## Rules

Alert Rules shows all of your project's alerts, their type, name, triggers, and actions. Use this page to create new alerts, determine if a component of your project needs alerting, or recognize unnecessary alerts.

## Settings

Alert subscription has available default settings and options to customize alerts to your personal needs.

### Issue Owners

MIMI NOTE: Issue owners are only for Issue Alerts.

By default, [issue owners](/product/error-monitoring/issue-owners/) receive alert emails. If an issue owner is not configured or not found, the email will either not send or send to all project members as defined in **Project Settings > Issue Owners**.

### Ignore

MIMI NOTE: also only for Issue Alerts.

When an issue is set to ignore, Sentry mutes the alerts for that issue. You can also ignore an issue until certain conditions are met. For example, "ignore for 30 minutes." Keep in mind; an ignored issue **will still count towards your quota**.

### Personal Alert Settings

Review your personal alert settings in **User Settings > Account > Notifications**. Use the "default project alerts" setting to set your default preference across all projects; subscribed or unsubscribed. Note: this setting does not affect alerts you've configured to send to your email explicitly.

After selecting the appropriate alert setting, selectively change it by project in **User Settings > Account > Fine tune alerts by project**. Each project has three options: Default, On, or Off. Selecting default uses your default preference from the previous step.
