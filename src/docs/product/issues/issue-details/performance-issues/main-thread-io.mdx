<Include name="early-adopter-note.mdx" />

The Main UI thread in a mobile application handles user interface events such as button presses and page scrolls. If the Main UI thread performs long running operations like File IO, it will block the whole UI until the operation is complete, preventing the user from interacting with the app. If the Main UI thread is blocked for a long period of time, it can cause App Hangs and Application Not Responding errors.

## Detection Criteria

The detector for this performance issue looks at the total non-overlapping duration for file io spans, and if it exceeds 16ms creates a Performance Issue.

## Span Evidence

The evidence for an file IO on main thread problem has four main aspects:

- Transaction name
- Parent span - This is the span where the File IO spans occurred during
- Offending Span - The actual spans that are performing IO in the main thread

## Example

Consider this Swift code where you're opening a file to get its content:

```swift
if let path = Bundle.main.path(forResource: "LoremIpsum", ofType: "txt") {
    let content = String(contentsOfFile: path)
    label.text = content
}
```

In order to fix this performance issue, you could use a dispatch queue:

```swift
let dispatchQueue = DispatchQueue(label: "ViewController", attributes: .concurrent) {
    dispatchQueue.async {
        if let path = Bundle.main.path(forResource: "LoremIpsum", ofType: "txt") {
            let content = String(contentsOfFile: path)
                DispatchQueue.main.async {
                    label.text = content
                }
        }
    }
}
```

Or alternatively for Kotlin:

```kotlin
val file = File(context.cacheDir, "LoremIpsum.txt")
val content = file.readText()
```

In order to fix this performance issue you can initialize another thread to read the file instead. 

```kotlin
suspend fun readFile(): String = withContext(Dispatchers.IO) {
    val file = File(context.cacheDir, "LoremIpsum.txt")
    val content = file.readText()
    return content
}
```
