The **Issue Details** page helps you to gain further insight into the source of the issue and the impact it has on your application's users. The main area of the page displays information about a specific event that's part of an issue. The top panel and right-hand sidebar of the page display a summary of all the events grouped together in this issue:

While the <SandboxLink scenario="oneIssue" projectSlug="react">Issue Details</SandboxLink> page displays information about a specific event that's part of an issue, you can navigate between the events of an issue using the "Older" and "Newer" buttons.

In the right hand sidebar, [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) reflects a summary that includes information such as how often the <SandboxLink scenario="oneIssue" projectSlug="react">issue</SandboxLink> has occurred in the last 24 hours and the last 30 days, as well as the last time and the first time the issue was seen. If the issue is linked to any GitHub or Jira issues, that's displayed here as well. Lastly, there is a facet map, which shows the distribution of values for the tags for all events included in the issue. All of these values are based on the environment that you've selected in the environment dropdown.

## Issue Categories & Page Details

There are two categories of issues: [error issues](/product/issues/issue-details/error-issues/) and [performance issues](/product/issues/issue-details/performance-issues/). Depending on the issue category and available event data, the **Issue Details** page displays a combination of the some of the following sections:

- **Trace Navigator** - An abbreviated view of the related [trace](/product/sentry-basics/tracing/distributed-tracing) for the current transaction.
- **Suspect Commits** - A commit that's been identified as potentially having caused an error event.
- **Tags** - Searchable key/value string pairs providing information such as the browser or device.
- **Screenshot** - Screenshot taken when a user experiences an error; only available on [certain SDKs](/product/issues/issue-details/error-issues/#screenshots).
- **Exception (Stack Trace)** - Shows you the line of code that the event errored on.
- **Span Evidence** - Information about the performance problem in the context of the current event
- **Breadcrumbs** - Provide a history and timeline leading up to the error event and are customizable.
- **Trace Details** - Augments existing error data by capturing interactions between your projects.
- **Event Grouping Information** - Provides details of how Sentry fingerprinted the event into the group.

Learn more about what's included an issue detail for each of these in [Error Issues](/product/issues/issue-details/error-issues/) and [Performance Issues](/product/issues/issue-details/performance-issues/).
