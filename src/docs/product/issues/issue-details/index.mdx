The Issue Details page helps you to gain further insight into the source of the issue and the impact it has on your application's users. The main area of the page displays information about a specific error event that's part of an issue. The top panel and right-hand sidebar of the page display a summary of all the events grouped together in this issue.

While the Issue Details page displays information about a specific error event that's part of an issue, you can navigate between the events of an issue using the "Older" and "Newer" buttons.


In the right hand sidebar, [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) reflects a summary of the that includes information such as how often the issue has occurred in the last 24 hours and the last 30 days, as well as the last time and the first time the issue was seen. If the issue is linked to any GitHub or Jira issues, that's displayed here as well. You can also use this section to link to existing GitHub or Jira issues. Learn more about linking issues in [Integrations](/product/integrations/). Lastly, there is a facet map, which shows the distribution of values for the tags for all events included in the issue. All of these values are based on the environment that you've selected in the Global Header.

In addition, this page provides several other key pieces of information.

## Suspect Commits

A _suspect commit_ is a commit that's been identified as potentially having caused the error event. If you've configured [suspect commits](/product/releases/suspect-commits/), these are displayed. This allows you to immediately investigate commits that are likely to have generated the issue. The owners of suspect commits can be suggested assignees for an issue as well.

## Tags

[Tags](/product/sentry-basics/search/) are key/value string pairs that are both indexed and searchable. For example, a tag provides you with information such as the browser, device, or user associated with the event. Tags are the diagnostic information sent by the SDK for the individual event.

The tags displayed in the main section of this page are specific to the event that you're viewing. In contrast, the tags displayed in the right-hand sidebar are a summary of all tag values for all events included in the issue. You can set your own tags to make them more useful for debugging as described in <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/tags/">Customize Tags</PlatformLink>.

## Exception (Stack Trace)

The Exception section of the page displays the stack trace, which shows you the line of code that all of the events in the issue errored on.

It's the most important piece of information that the Sentry grouping algorithm uses to group events into one issue.

## Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs provide a history and timeline leading up to the error event. These can include things like HTTP requests, log statements from the console or server, and DOM (document object model) events in JavaScript.

You can set your own <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/">breadcrumbs</PlatformLink> to make them more useful for debugging.


## Trace Details

[Tracing](/product/performance/distributed-tracing/) augments your existing error data by capturing interactions between your software systems. In the Trace Details section, you can click the "Search by Trace" button to see all the events that share the same trace ID.

This page displays the Details tab when it first opens, but several other tabs are available:

- Activity: A history of activity for the event where team members can share comments.
- User Feedback: Any feedback collected from users through the <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/user-feedback/">SDK's user feedback</PlatformLink>.
- <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/attachments/">Attachments</PlatformLink>: Stored additional files, such as config or log files that are attached to the event.
- Tags: More detailed information about the tags across all the events included in the issue.
- Events: A list of all the events included in the issue.
- Merged Issues: A list of issues that have been merged with this one.
- Similar Issues: A list of issues that have a similar stack trace.
