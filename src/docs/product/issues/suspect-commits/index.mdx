When you've enabled suspect commits, we can tie together the commits in the release, including:

- Files touched by those commits
- Files observed in the stack trace
- Authors of those files
- The issue number in a commit message

Suspect commits and suggested assignees will then display on the **Issue Details** page in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io):

## Enable Suspect Commits

This process assumes that source maps — or your platform-specific files for mapping transformed source code to the original source — have been uploaded (check out the docs for your [specific platform](/platforms/)).

### Connect a Repository Using Integrations

Suspect commits can be enabled using the following integrations:
- [GitHub](/product/integrations/source-code-mgmt/github/)
- [GitLab](/product/integrations/source-code-mgmt/gitlab/)

In [sentry.io](https://sentry.io), go to **Settings > Integrations** for your organization, and click the integration you’d like to use. You’ll need to configure the integration first, if you haven’t already, and add the repository you'd like to use.

### Set Up Code Mappings

1. Navigate to **Settings > Integrations > [Integration] > Configurations**.

1. Click the "Configure" button.

1. Click the **Code Mappings** tab.

1. Set up a code mapping for each project for which you want to enable suspect commits. To create a new code mapping, click **Add Mapping**.

1. Fill out the form, then click **Save Changes**. Each form field is described below:


#### Code Mapping Form Fields

- **project** (required) - The Sentry project.
- **repo** (required) - The GitHub repository associated with the Sentry project above. If you have more than one GitHub repository being used per Sentry project, you'll need multiple code mappings.
- **branch** (required) - The default branch of your code we fall back to if you don't have commit tracking set up.
- **stack trace root** and **source code root** (optional):
 - If the file path in your Sentry stack trace frame matches the path to your source code, you don't need to set these values. For example, everything after the branch (`main`) matches the file path of `code.py` using a source code path of `https://github.com/MeredithAnya/testing/blob/main/code.py` so you don't need to set a **stack trace root** and **source code root**.
 - If the filename in your Sentry stack trace frame doesn't match the path to your source code, you'll need to replace the **stack_root** part of the filename with your **source_root** to make the filename match the source code path. For example, to get `src/code.py` to match `code.py` when the source code path is `https://github.com/MeredithAnya/testing/blob/main/code.py`, change the **stack trace root** to be set as `src/`, and leave **source code root** empty.

The first frame in the stack trace is considered suspect when looking at them top-down. If the first frame is not in-app, the next frame is considered suspect.

## Issue Missing Suspect Commits

There are a few reasons why an issue might not have suspect commits:
- Your GitHub or GitLab integration isn't set up or has become disconnected.
- The issue doesn't have a stack trace or doesn't have any in-app frames.
- The stack trace doesn't have any in-app frames that match the code mappings.
