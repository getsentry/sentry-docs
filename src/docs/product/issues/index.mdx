The **Issues** page displays information about errors and performance problems in your application. This page allows you to filter by properties such as browser, device, impacted users, or whether an error is unhandled. You can then inspect issue details to better understand the problem and [triage](/product/issues/states-triage/) effectively.

A typical application sends a large number of events to Sentry. You can think of an <SandboxLink scenario="oneIssue" projectSlug="react">issue</SandboxLink> as a single bug or problem with your app. To make them manageable, we group similar events into issues based on a fingerprint. This grouping of events into issues allows you to see how frequently a problem is happening and how many users it's affecting.

<Note>

Sentry provides tools to control the type and amount of errors and transactions that are monitored. Learn more in [Quota Management](/product/accounts/quotas/).

</Note>

For each issue, the page displays:

- Issue type and description
- Associated project
- Issue timing, such as last and first time seen

For error issues, to see the stack trace of the latest event, you can hover over the issue title. You can also hover over the coloured square to the left of the issue information to see the error level (error, info, fatal, warning, debug, or sample) of the latest event:

When you click on an issue on the main **Issues** page, the **Issue Details** page for that issue is displayed. Learn more in [Issue Details](/product/issues/issue-details/).

## Error Issues

An [_error issue_](/product/issues/issue-details/error-issues/) is a grouping of error events. What counts as an error varies by platform, but in general, if there's something that looks like an exception, it can be captured as an error in Sentry. Sentry automatically captures errors, uncaught exceptions, and unhandled rejections, as well as other types of errors, depending on platform. We group similar error events into issues based on a fingerprint. For error issues, a fingerprint is primarily defined by the event stack trace.

## Performance Issues

A [_performance issue_](/product/issues/issue-details/performance-issues/) is a grouping of transaction events that are performing poorly. If your application is configured for [Performance Monitoring](/product/performance/), Sentry will detect common performance problems, and group them into issues. We group similar transaction events into issues based on a fingerprint. For performance issues, a fingerprint is primarily based on the problem type and the spans involved in the problem. You can learn more about how performance issues work in [Performance Issues](/product/issues/issue-details/performance-issues/).

## Issue Triage

From the **Issues** page, you can begin to triage. The page is organized into tabs, each corresponding to a filtered list of issues, and these different lists help you with triaging:

- All Unresolved (`is:unresolved`): All unresolved issues, including issues that need review.
- For Review (`is:unresolved is:for_review`): Also called **Review List**. Issues that need to be reviewed; for-review issues are a sub-set of all unresolved issues.
- Ignored (`is:ignored`): All ignored issues.
- Saved Searches: Select from a set of [recommended](/product/sentry-basics/search/saved-searches/#recommended-searches) and [custom saved searches](/product/sentry-basics/search/saved-searches/#organization-wide-saved-searches). The name of the tab changes based on your selection.

Learn more about triaging issues and their different states in [Issue States and Triage](/product/issues/states-triage/).

You can also add issues data to your [custom dashboards](/product/dashboards/custom-dashboards/), as widgets, using the [dataset selector](/product/dashboards/widget-builder/#choose-your-dataset).
