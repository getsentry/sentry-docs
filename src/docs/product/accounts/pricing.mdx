This document clarifies concepts and frequently asked questions around pricing. For the breakdown of plans and prices, go to our [pricing page](https://sentry.io/pricing/).

## Concepts

### Events

An event is an error, attachment, or transaction sent to Sentry’s server for processing. Additional metadata around the event (breadcrumbs, user context, environment, traces) do not count separately.

### Capacity

Capacity is the total number of events sent by and billed to your organization. You can purchase capacity in two ways: on-demand and reserved.

#### On-demand Capacity

On-demand capacity is billed at the end of each billing cycle. You are charged per processed event, rounded up to the nearest cent. You have the ability to set on-demand caps so you can stay on budget. See [On-demand spending cap](#on-demand-cap) for more information.

#### Prepaid (Reserved) Capacity

Reserved capacity allows you to prepay for significant discounts. Your prepaid, reserved capacity is always applied before on-demand capacity. Unused reserved capacity expires at the end of each billing month.

Every Sentry account includes a varying amount of reserved capacity. For example, our Team plan includes 50k errors, 100k transactions, and 1 GB of attachments per month.

### Billing Cycles

Two different billing periods are available.

The first is your actual **Billing Period**, which is either monthly or annual. This is when we’ll charge the credit card on file for automatic renewal.

The second is the **On-Demand Period**. The On-Demand Period reflects a one month window in which we calculate On-Demand charges.

### Billing Controls

#### On-demand spending cap {#on-demand-cap}

You can set a maximum monthly on-demand bill amount by setting an on-demand spending cap. Once you reach the spending cap, you will still be able to access Sentry and prior event data. However, any additional events you send will be rejected.

#### Rate limits

Business plans have the option to configure rate limits for each project that let you specify the number of events and time interval for rate limiting.

## Managing your event volume

If your projects have a high volume of events, you can control how many errors Sentry receives by reviewing Sentry's guide to [Manage Your Event Stream](/product/accounts/quotas/manage-event-stream-guide/).

## FAQ

**What happens when my trial expires?**

You will be downgraded to the same plan you were on prior to starting the trial. Before the trial ends, Sentry will provide you options to upgrade and continue to use our latest features like Performance Monitoring.

**Who sees my events?**

You control who can see events. We allow you to add your team members, as well as share events with anonymous users should you wish to do so.

**Events now include transactions, errors, and attachments? What's the difference?**

An _event_ is one instance of you sending Sentry data. What can be captured as an error depends on your platform. In general, if you have something that looks like an exception, it will be sent to Sentry as an error event. _Attachments_ are files uploaded in the same request, such as log files. In addition, the files within the crash uploaded to Sentry can be persisted by enabling storage of crash reports. A _transaction_ represents a single instance of a service being called to support an operation you want to measure or track, like a page load.

**What is included in the free trial for current customers?**

Trials include transactions and attachments as well as business features like cross-project Discover. Current paying customers can sign up for a 30-day trial; free plans can run a trial for 14 days.

**If I start the free trial, but do not want to opt into transactions once the trial is over, can I keep my old plan and pricing?**

Yes, you can keep your current plan and pricing.

**If I opt into a new plan, when does the new plan take effect?**

New plans take effect immediately.

**Can I buy a plan for only transactions?**

Our minimum plan provides 100k transactions, 50k errors, and 1GB of attachments. If you need more of any of the three types of events we track, use the slider on our [pricing](https://sentry.io/pricing/) page to add what you need.

**How do I manage my monthly spending?**

The slider on the [pricing](https://sentry.io/pricing/) page allows you to choose the volume you'd like for each type of event - errors, transactions, or attachments storage.

**If I downgrade mid-year, when does it apply?**

Downgrades and cancellations are processed as the end of the current contract cycle and cannot be refunded.

**What happens if I continue to send events after my on-demand spending cap is consumed?**

All additional events are rejected.

**If I raise my on-demand spending cap mid-month, when will my organization start accepting events again?**

Your organization will start accepting additional events as soon as your new cap is applied. We guarantee new caps will be applied within 24 hours. However, in most cases your organization will start accepting events within minutes.

**If I lower my on-demand spending cap mid-month below this month’s existing bill, when will the new cap take effect? What will my on-demand bill be?**

We guarantee your new, lowered on-demand spending cap will be applied within 24 hours. In the meantime, the old on-demand spending cap will remain in effect. However, in most cases, the new spending cap will be applied within minutes.

After the new spending cap is in effect, all additional events will be rejected and no additional on-demand capacity will be added. At end of billing month, you will be charged for any on-demand capacity consumed.

**If I want to cancel monthly billing, what happens?**

Your plan will continue until the end of the current billing cycle. After this, you’ll revert to the base developer plan, which includes a limited number of events and team members.

**Where can I find my previous invoices/receipts?**

Users with the role of [Billing or Owner](/product/accounts/membership/) can find all previous invoices by going to **Organization > Usage & Billing > Usage & Payments > Receipts**.

<Note><markdown>

You must have either `Billing` or `Owner` permissions to access and/or make changes to information on this page. If you don't have those permissions, or you are not a member of the organization in Sentry, please reach out to a Billing member or an Owner to obtain invoices.
