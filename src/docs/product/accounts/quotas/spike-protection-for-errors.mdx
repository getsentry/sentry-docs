Sentry's Spike Protection checks for significant overages in error events, (as compared to an established spike threshold), on a per-project basis. If a spike is detected, Spike Protection kicks in, dropping events once they've reached a certain threshold.

Spike Protection can be enabled on a per-project basis for your organization by any team member with either **Billing or Owner-level permissions**. To select which project to set it up for, go to  **Settings > Spike Protection**. You'll be able to toggle it on for individual projects or click “Enable All” to set it up for all your projects at once. Learn more about how spike protection works and how to manage spikes in [Spike Protection](/product/accounts/quotas/spike-protection/).
