All Sentry plans include 1 cron monitor. To activate additional monitors, you need to add [on-demand](/product/accounts/pricing/#on-demand-capacity) spend.

<Note>

On-demand spend is only available on paid plans.

## Before You Begin: Check Your Available On-Demand Spend

## Activating Additional Monitors

Additional monitors will be activated upon creation if there is available on-demand spend. Alternatively, inactive monitors can be manually activated when on-demand spend is availalbe.

Active monitors will remain active across billing periods if on-demand spend is available.

## Deactivating Monitors

Monitors can be manually deactivated at anytime from the **Crons** page.

All monitors are automatically deactivated at the start of a new billing period if on-demand spend is reduced or not available to cover all active monitors. Monitors can be manually activated based on on-demand availability.
