Data and quotas are interconnected in Sentry. At the most basic level, when you [subscribe to Sentry](https://sentry.io/pricing/), you pay for the amount of data &#151 events (errors and transactions) and attachments &#151 to be tracked. Each of these data categories has a quota. When Sentry accepts an event or attachment, it counts toward your quota for that type of data.

To see which of your projects are using up your quota, you can review the "Usage" tab of **Stats**. This page is accessible to all members of your organization, so a Billing or Owner member can share this page with the developers directly responsible for a given project. In addition, you can come back to this page to check if the changes you've made are having the desired effect:

You can also download a project breakdown report in the "Usage History" tab of **Settings > Subscriptions** (only accessible to Owner and Billing members of your Sentry organization).

Sentry's flexibility means you can exercise fine-grained control over which events and attachments count toward your quota. This page provides you with high-level information about strategies for managing your quota, but you can get more detailed information in:

- [Manage Your Error Quota](/product/accounts/quotas/manage-event-stream-guide/)
- [Manage Your Transaction Quota](/product/accounts/quotas/manage-transaction-quota/)
- [Manage Your Attachments Quota](/product/accounts/quotas/manage-attachments-quota/)

## Manage Your Quota - Quick Guide

This list of strategies for managing your quota is ordered from easiest or least time-consuming to most challenging or potentially time-consuming. Each of these items is linked to a longer explanation if you need it and the table indicates whether the action can affect errors, transactions, attachments or a combination of all three. Options 1-5 are all things you can do in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io), whereas the remaining ones are things you'll do in the SDK.

## Key Terms

Let's clarify a few terms to start:

- **Event** - An event is one instance of you sending data to Sentry, excluding attachments. Generally, this data is an error or a transaction.
- **Error** - What counts as an error varies by platform, but in general, if there's something that looks like an exception, it can be captured as an error in Sentry. Sentry automatically captures errors, uncaught exceptions, and unhandled rejections, as well as other types of errors, depending on platform. A grouping of similar errors makes [an issue](/product/issues/).
- **Transaction** - A [transaction](/product/performance/transaction-summary/#what-is-a-transaction) represents a single instance of a service being called to support an operation you want to measure or track, like a page load. Transaction events are grouped by the transaction name.
- **Attachment** - Attachments are stored additional files, such as config files, log files, or stored mini-dumps, that are related to an error event. Unless the option to store crash reports is enabled, Sentry will use these files only to create an event, and then drop them.
- **Data** - Anything you send to Sentry. This includes events (errors or transactions), attachments, and event metadata.
- **Quota** - Your quota is the amount of data (errors, transactions, attachments) that you pay Sentry to track.

## Manage Your Quota - Overview {#what-counts-toward-my-quota-an-overview}

Sentry completes a thorough evaluation of each event to determine if it counts toward your quota, as outlined in this overview. Detailed documentation for each evaluation is linked throughout.

Before completing any of these evaluations, Sentry confirms that each event includes a valid DSN and project as well as whether the event can be parsed. In addition, for error events, Sentry validates that the event contains valid fingerprint information. If any of these items are missing or incorrect, the event is rejected.

<Note>

This list is ordered from easiest or least time-consuming to most challenging or potentially time-consuming. This isn't the order in which evaluations take place.

</Note>

### 1. Spike Protection {#spike-protection}

Sentry’s spike protection prevents huge overages in error events from consuming your event volume, and it's enabled for all accounts by default. You can confirm that spike protection is enabled in **Settings > Subscription**. Learn more about how spike protection works and how to manage spikes in [Manage Your Error Quota](/product/accounts/quotas/manage-event-stream-guide/#1-spike-protection).

### 2. Adjusting Your Quota {#increasing-quotas}

Events and attachments that exceed your quota are not accepted, so you may want to increase your quota. Conversely, you might want to decrease your quota or adjust your reserved and on-demand quotas to better control your spending. Learn about adjusting your quota in [Manage Your Error Quota](/product/accounts/quotas/manage-event-stream-guide/#2-adjusting-quotas), [Manage Your Transaction Quota](/product/accounts/quotas/manage-transaction-quota/#1-adjusting-quotas), and [Manage Your Attachments Quota](/product/accounts/quotas/manage-attachments-quota/#1-adjusting-quotas).

### 3. Rate Limits {#limiting-events}

You can add limits for error events on a per-project basis in **[Project] > Settings > Client Keys (DSN)**. If the event rate limit for a project has been exceeded, and your subscription allows, the event won't be counted. You can also rate limit attachments on an organization level in **Settings > Security & Privacy**. Learn more in [Manage Your Error Quota](/product/accounts/quotas/manage-event-stream-guide/#6-rate-limiting) and [Manage Your Attachments Quota](/product/accounts/quotas/manage-attachments-quota/#2-rate-limiting).

### 4. Event Repetition

In some cases, repeated events can count against your quota, so it's important to know how event repetition is treated in Sentry. Learn more in [Manage Your Error Quota](/product/accounts/quotas/manage-event-stream-guide/#5-applying-workflows).

### 5. Inbound Filters {#inbound-data-filters}

If an inbound filter is applied for a type of error, transaction, or attachment, and your subscription allows, it won't be counted. You can manage these in **[Project] > Settings > Inbound Filters**. Learn more in [Manage Your Error Quota](/product/accounts/quotas/manage-event-stream-guide/#3-inbound-data-filters), [Manage Your Transaction Quota](/product/accounts/quotas/manage-transaction-quota/#2-inbound-data-filters), and [Manage Your Attachments Quota](/product/accounts/quotas/manage-attachments-quota/#3-inbound-data-filters).

### 6. SDK Sample Rate

If a sample rate is defined for the SDK, the SDK evaluates whether this event should be sent as a representative fraction of events, effectively limiting the number of errors and transactions you send to Sentry. Setting a sample rate is documented [for each SDK](/platform-redirect/?next=/configuration/sampling/), but you can also learn more in [Manage Your Error Quota](/product/accounts/quotas/manage-event-stream-guide/#6-sdk-sample-rate) and [Manage Your Transaction Quota](/product/accounts/quotas/manage-transaction-quota/#2-sdk-configuration-tracing-options).

### 7. SDK Filtering: `beforeSend`

All Sentry SDKs support the `beforeSend` callback method, which you can use to modify the data of an error event or to drop it completely. Learn more in [Manage Your Error Quota](/product/accounts/quotas/manage-event-stream-guide/#1-sdk-filtering-beforesend).

### 8. SDK Configuration

The SDK configuration either allows an event to be sent to Sentry or filters it out. Configuration is documented [for each SDK](/platform-redirect/?next=/configuration/filtering/), but you can also learn more in [Manage Your Error Quota](/product/accounts/quotas/manage-event-stream-guide/#2-sdk-configuration) and [Manage Your Transaction Quota](/product/accounts/quotas/manage-transaction-quota/#2-sdk-configuration-tracing-options).

### 9. Size Limits {#size-limits}

Sentry imposes limits on various fields within an event, as well as the size of full events and the requests they are sent in, which can affect your attachments quota. Learn more in [Manage Your Attachments Quota](/product/accounts/quotas/manage-attachments-quota/#4-size-limits).

## What Counts Toward Your Quota - Quick Guide {#what-counts-toward-my-quota-table-view}

This table outlines whether or not an an event or attachment that you send to Sentry counts against your quota.

| This is a [repeated event](#4-event-repetition) for which issues were previously set to Delete & Discard (errors) |  |
| This is a [repeated event](#4-event-repetition) for a previously resolved issue (errors) | &check; |
| This is a [repeated event](#4-event-repetition) for an issue that you've set to Ignore | &check; |
| The event defies [inbound filters](#inbound-data-filters) configured in sentry.io  |  |
| The event is sent after the [SDK sample rate](#6-sdk-sample-rate) has been exceeded |  |
| The event isn't sent based on [SDK filters](#7-sdk-filtering-beforesend) |  |
| The event isn't sent based on [SDK configuration](#8-sdk-configuration) |  |
| [Size limits](#size-limits) have been exceeded |  |
