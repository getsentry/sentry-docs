Events and quotas are interconnected in Sentry. At the most basic, when you [subscribe to Sentry](https://sentry.io/pricing/), you pay for the number of events - errors, attachments, and transactions - to be tracked. Each of these type of events has a quota. When Sentry accepts an event, it counts toward your quota for that type of event.

Sentry’s flexibility means you can exercise fine-grained control over which events count toward your quota.

## Key Terms

Let’s clarify a few terms to start:

- **Event** - An event is one instance of you sending data to Sentry. Generally, this data is an error or a transaction.
- **Error** - An error is.... A grouping of similar errors makes [an issue](/product/issues/).
- **Transaction** - A [transaction](/product/performance/transaction-summary/#what-is-a-transaction) represents a single instance of a service being called to support an operation you want to measure or track, like a page load. Transaction events are grouped by the transaction name.
- **Attachment** - Attachments are uploaded files associated with an error event, such as log files. Unless the option to store crash reports is enabled, Sentry will use these files only to create an event, and then drop them.
- **Quota** - Your quota is the monthly number of data units — errors, attachments, and transactions — that you pay Sentry to track.

## Manage Your Quota - Quick Guide

This list of things to do to manage your quota is arranged from the fastest and least involved thing you can do to the most. Each of these items is linked to a longer explanation if you need it and the table indicates whether the action can affect, errors, transactions, or attachments or a combination of those.

## Managing My Quota, an Overview -->

## Some Other Heading

Sentry completes a thorough evaluation of each event to determine if it counts toward your quota, as outlined in this overview. Detailed documentation for each evaluation is linked throughout. Before completing any of these evaluations, Sentry confirms that each event includes a valid DSN and project as well as whether the event can be parsed. In addition, for error events, Sentry validates that the event contains valid fingerprint information. If any of these items are missing or incorrect, the event is rejected.

### 1. Spike Protection

Sentry’s spike protection prevents huge overages in error events from consuming your event capacity. Spike protection is not currently available for transactions. Learn more in the Spike Protection section of [Manage Your Error Quota](/product/accounts/quotas/manage-event-stream-guide/#1-spike-protection).

### 2. Event Usage Stats

blah blah

Learn more in the Event Usage Stats section of [Manage Your Error Quota](/product/accounts/quotas/manage-event-stream-guide/#common-workflows-for-managing-your-event-stream) and [Manage Your Transaction Quota](/product/accounts/quotas/manage-transaction-quota/#1-event-usage-stats).

### 3. Quota Availability

Events that exceed your quota are not accepted. Once your event volume is approaching or has exceeded the quota, teammates with the "owner" organization permission level will receive [notification](/product/alerts/notifications/#quota-notifications) emails. Learn about adding to your quota and what happens when you exceed it in the Increasing Quotas section of [Manage Your Error Quota](/product/accounts/quotas/manage-event-stream-guide/#3-increasing-quotas) and [Manage Your Transaction Quota](/product/accounts/quotas/manage-transaction-quota/#2-increasing-quotas).

### 4. Rate Limits

If the error event rate limit for a project has been exceeded, and your subscription allows, the event will not be counted. You can add limits for error events and attachments in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io). This does not apply to transaction events. Learn more in the Rate Limiting section of [Manage Your Error Quota](/product/accounts/quotas/manage-event-stream-guide/#4-rate-limiting) or

#### Attachment Limits

If you have enabled the storage of crash reports, you may set limits for the maximum number of crash reports that will be stored per issue. To set up these limits, use the slider in the "Store Native Crash Reports" option in your organization's "Security & Privacy" settings.

### 6. Event Repetition

Event repetition only applies to error events, not transactions or attachments. The following rules apply for event repetition and your quota:

- If you have chosen to "Delete & Discard" an issue, then _future_ error events with the same fingerprint do not count toward your quota. Learn more in the Delete & Discard section of [Manage Your Error Quota](/product/accounts/quotas/manage-event-stream-guide/#5-applying-workflows).
- If you previously resolved an issue, a new error event counts toward your quota because it may represent a regression in your code.
- If you have chosen to ignore alerts about error events with the same fingerprint, a new event counts toward your quota because the event is still occurring. Learn more in the Inbound Filters section of [Manage Your Error Quota](/product/accounts/quotas/manage-event-stream-guide/#6-inbound-data-filters).

### 7. Inbound Filters

If any inbound filter is set for a type of event or attachment, and your subscription allows, the event or attachment won't be counted. Learn more in the Inbound Data Filters section of [Manage Your Error Quota](/product/accounts/quotas/manage-event-stream-guide/#6-inbound-data-filters) and [Manage Your Transaction Quota](/product/accounts/quotas/manage-transaction-quota/#3-inbound-data-filters).

After these checks are processed, the event counts toward your quota. It is accepted into Sentry, where it persists and is stored.

### 8. SDK Sample Rate

If a sample rate is defined for the SDK, the SDK evaluates whether this event should be sent as a representative fraction of events. Setting a sample rate is documented for each SDK. The SDK sample rate is not dynamic; changing it requires re-deployment. In addition, setting an SDK sample rate limits visibility into the source of events. Setting a rate limit for your project may better suit your needs. Learn more in the SDK Sample Rate section of [Manage Your Error Quota](/product/accounts/quotas/manage-event-stream-guide/#8-sdk-sample-rate) and [Manage Your Transaction Quota](/product/accounts/quotas/manage-transaction-quota/#4-sdk-sample-rate).

### 9. SDK Filtering

Blah blah

Learn More in the SDK Filtering section of [Manage Your Error Quota](/product/accounts/quotas/manage-event-stream-guide/#9-sdk-filtering-beforesend).

### 10. SDK Configuration

The SDK configuration either allows the event or filters the event out. Learn more in the SDK Configuration section of [Manage Your Error Quota](/product/accounts/quotas/manage-event-stream-guide/#10-sdk-configuration) and [Manage Your Transaction Quota](/product/accounts/quotas/manage-transaction-quota/#2-sdk-configuration-tracing-options) or in the [filtering docs for your specific SDK](/platform-redirect/?next=/configuration/filtering/).

## A Note About Size Limits

Sentry imposes limits on various fields within an event, as well as the size of full events and the requests they are sent in:

- Events, attachments, and requests exceeding payload size limits are immediately dropped with a `413 Payload Too Large` error. Sentry allows compressed content encoding, and applies separate limits before and after decompression.
- Fields exceeding the individual size limits are afterwards trimmed and truncated at a best effort.

To avoid unintentional data loss, consider limiting the size of values passed into Sentry's APIs. For example, if your application attaches application state or request bodies to Sentry events, truncate them first.

The precise limits may change over time. For more information, please refer to the following resources:

- [Envelope Size Limits](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/store/#size-limits)
- [Store Endpoint Size Limits](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/store/#size-limits)
- [Minidump Size Limits](/platforms/native/guides/minidumps/#size-limits)
- [Variable Size Limits](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/data-handling/#variable-size)

<Alert>

If the event exceeds 200KB compressed or 1MB decompressed for events and 20MB
compressed or 100MB decompressed for minidump uploads (all files combined),
the event will be rejected.

</Alert>
