## Membership

Sentry handles user membership at the organizational level, but also supports team-level roles for users on a [Business plan](https://sentry.io/pricing/). Individual users can manage their personal preferences, including notifications and security settings, and can use their individual Sentry account to join multiple teams.

## Organization-level Roles

Check out the table below for all org-level roles and their permissions.

### Team Admin

- Admin access to the teams of which they're members.
- Can create new teams and Projects, as well as remove Projects and teams of which they're members.

### Team Contributor

- Can view and act on issues.
- Can join and leave teams (depending on the rules set by the org owner/manager).
- Can invite new members to join (pending approval from org owner/manager).
- Can add Projects for team (depending on the rules set by the org owner/manager).

## Open Membership

Open membership is enabled by default. This allows users to join, leave, and add other members to teams.

## Restricting Access

- Project access is limited to the team that owns the Project, but org members can get access to the Project by joining the team that owns it, (depending on the rules set by the org owner/manager).
- To limit access to a Project, you can limit access to the team that owns that Project by making it invite-only. Users will only be able to join from an invitation by a Manager, Owner, or Admin.

To restrict team access, go to the Settings page > General Settings and flip the “Open Membership” toggle.

## Transferring a Project

To transfer a Project to a new owner, go to the target Project's **Project Settings > General Settings > Transfer Project**. Enter the email address of the person you’d like to transfer it to. They'll receive an email to approve the transfer.

When transferring a Project to a new organization, we recommend also adding a new team to the Project for better visibility.

## Removing an Organization

If you’re an org owner, you can remove an entire organization and all its associated data completely. Doing so will *not* remove user accounts, but it will remove user membership in that organization.

To remove an organization, go to the **Settings** **page** **> General Settings,** then \*\*\*\*click the "Remove Organization" button, which will prompt you for confirmation. After this is done, your organization will be queued for deletion.
