1. For "1. General Settings", no special settings are needed. 

1. For "2. Sign On Options", fill in these fields as follows: 
   
   - Base URL: `https://sentry.io`
      
      - Important: There should not be a trailing slash at the end of the URL as it will break the redirect from Okta to Sentry.
      
   - Organization Slug: *YOUR_ORG_SLUG*
   
      - You can find your organization slug in the URL: `https://sentry.io/organizations/YOUR_ORG_SLUG/`
      
   - Email: `Email`

1. Sentry will attempt to authenticate and link your account with Okta. After successful authentication, you'll be redirected to Sentry's SSO configuration page, where you can take the following actions:

   - You can share the "Login URL" value, which will be used for SP-initiated SSO, with the users in your organization.
   
   - Scroll down to the bottom and ensure that "Require SSO" is checked if you want to enforce logging in with Okta.
   
   - Set a "Default Role" for new SSO users. Selecting "Member" should cover most use-cases.
   
   - If you made changes, click "Save Settings" to complete your setup.
