1. For `1. General Settings`, no special settings is needed. 

1. For `2. Sign On Options`. Fill in the following
   
   - Base URL: `https://sentry.io`
      
      - There should not be a trailing slash at the end of the URL as it will break the redirect from Okta to Sentry.
      
   - Organization Slug: *YOUR_ORG_SLUG*
   
      - You can find your organization slug on the URL: `https://sentry.io/organizations/YOUR_ORG_SLUG/`
      
   - Email: `Email`

1. After successful authentication, you'll be redirected to the configuration page for Okta.

   - The `Login URL` will be used for SP-initiated SSO.
   
   - If you want to enforce logging in with Okta, ensure that `Require SSO` is checked. 
   
   - Set a `Default Role` for new SSO users. Selecting `Member` should cover most use-cases.
   
   - If you made changes, click **Save Settings** and you're done!
