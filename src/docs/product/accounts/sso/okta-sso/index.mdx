1. Provide the settings. Note that for "1. General Settings", you will not need to provide any special settings. For "2. Sign On Options", provide the following:

   - Base URL: `https://sentry.io` <Alert level="warning">Ensure that the Base URL does not have a trailing slash or whitespace at the end as they will break the redirect from Okta to Sentry.</Alert>

   - Organization Slug: *YOUR_ORG_SLUG*

      - You can find your organization slug in the URL: `https://sentry.io/organizations/YOUR_ORG_SLUG/`

Sentry will attempt to authenticate and link your account with Okta. After successful authentication, you'll be redirected to Sentry's SSO configuration page, where you can:

   - Share the "Login URL" value, which will be used for SP-initiated SSO, with the users in your organization.

   - Scroll down to the bottom and ensure that "Require SSO" is checked if you want to enforce logging in with Okta.

   - Set a "Default Role" for new SSO users. Selecting "Member" should cover most use cases.

If you make any changes, click "Save Settings" to complete your set up.
