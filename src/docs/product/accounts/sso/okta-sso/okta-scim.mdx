   ![Sentry Okta SCIM Auth Page](../scim-settings-auth.png)

### Okta Configuration

1. Sign in to your Okta organization with your administrator account. From the admin console's sidebar, select Applications > Applications, then select the existing Sentry application.

1. Select the "Provisioning" tab, then "Configure API integration".
   ![Okta configure SCIM API](scim-okta-configure.png)

1. Select "Enable API Integration", enter the SCIM URL from the auth settings page as the Base URL field. For the API Token, copy the Auth Token value from the auth settings page.

1. Select "Test API Credentials", and confirm the message "the app was verified successfully" displays.

1. Select "Save" to be directed to SCIM App settings.

1. On the Provisioning page, select "To App", then "edit":
   ![Okta Save SCIM Settings](scim-okta-edit.png)

1. Enable both "Create Users" and "Deactivate Users", then "Save" your changes.
    ![Okta Create and Deactivate Users](okta-user-sync.png)

As a result of these changes, users who are assigned will be sent an invitation email. When a user is un-assigned, their membership object in Sentry will be deleted.

You can use "Push Groups" to sync and assign groups in Okta; they will be reflected in Sentry teams.

<Alert level="note">

If you use Okta to assign organization membership, you’ll be unable to make membership changes through Sentry and will need to continue using Okta. To remove these users, you will have to deprovision them in Okta.

</Alert>

### Configuring organization-level roles (Beta)

<Alert level="warning">

Organization role provisioning is in beta. If you'd like to try this feature, contact support@sentry.io.

</Alert>

Here's how to assign an organization-level role to an Okta group:

1. Add a new custom attribute to your Okta application profile.

  a. Navigate to your application settings in Okta

  b. Under the "Provisioning" tab, select "Go to Profile Editor"
        ![Okta Provisioning Page](okta-go-to-profile.png)

  c. Select "+ Add Attribute"
        ![Okta Add Attribute](okta-add-attribute.png)

  d. Fill out the form with the following settings (you can set whatever value you want for any setting not listed below):

    * Data Type: `string`
    * Display Name: `Org Role`
    * Variable Name: `sentryOrgRole`
    * External name: `sentryOrgRole`
    * External namespace: `urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User`
    * Attribute type: `Group`
  ![Okta Custom Attribute](./okta-custom-attribute-values.png)


2. Assign a group to your okta application
    ![Okta Assign Group](okta-assign-group.png)

3. In the form, enter the string for the org-level role
    ![Okta Set Role](okta-set-group-attribute.png)

- If the `sentryOrgField` field is left blank, Group members will be provisioned with the default organization-level role. This default role is configured in Sentry, under Settings -> Organization -> Auth. Otherwise, the role must be one of the following:
  - Admin
  - Manager
  - Billing
  - Member
- Invalid role names will prevent group members from being provisioned. To try again, you'll need to remove the group first.
- For security, The "Owner" role cannot be provisioned through SCIM.
  - For self-hosted users with custom roles, this extends to any role with the `org:admin` permission

<Alert level="note">

If a user is a member of multiple Okta groups, only the attributes set by the first group will be used.

</Alert>

<Alert level="note">

If you use Okta to assign organization-level roles, you’ll be unable to make membership changes through Sentry and will need to continue using Okta. To change a user's organization-level role, you will need to deprovision and then reprovision them with the new role.

</Alert>

Users who've had their roles assigned via Okta will only be able to make membership changes via Okta.

## Troubleshooting

### I get an error in Okta when provisioning a user saying "Matching user not found".

Make sure that `Create User` and `Deactivate User` are enabled in the "Provisioning" tab of your Sentry application in Okta [(see Okta Configuration step 7)](#okta-configuration).

### I assigned Sentry to a group but no team was created.

Assigning Sentry to a group in Okta is the same as assigning Sentry to every member of that group. Functionally, this
provisions every group member within Sentry, but does not create a team. In order to create a team, push the group to Sentry from the `Push Groups` tab of your Sentry application in Okta.

### I pushed a group to Sentry but the team is empty.

Pushing a group via Okta only tells Sentry to create a new team with the same name as the Okta group. Group
members will be added to the Sentry team only if the user is already provisioned. Make sure that your group in Okta contains the appropriate users and that they are provisioned before pushing the group to Sentry.

### I’m unable to use the Sentry application to remove a member whose membership is managed by an identity provider.

When team membership is managed by an identity provider (such as Okta), it can only be updated or revoked via that identity provider.

### I’m unable to use the Sentry application to add or remove members from my team.

If you use Okta to assign members to a team, you’ll be unable to make membership changes through Sentry and will need to continue using Okta.

### I used Okta to remove a user from Sentry, but they’re still showing up in my Sentry organization.

Make sure that `Deactivate User` is enabled in the "Provisioning" tab of your Sentry application in Okta. Re-provision the user, then remove them again.

#### How do I remove the organization-level role for a user that I sent through Okta?

If the user is part of a group with an organization-level role assigned, remove the group from the Sentry application. Remove the user from the group and re-provision the user separately, then re-provision the group with its original role. If the user is the only member of a group, re-provision the group with a blank role.

If the user is not part of a group with an organization-level role assigned, re-provision the user with a blank role.

### Known Issues

- The Import Users feature is not currently supported. Sentry's SCIM API does not at this time support the User `name` attribute fields `firstName` and `lastName`. Instead, we return these with values of `N/A` for compatibility purposes.
- Setting `active` to `false` on a User will delete the organization member record associated with the user.
- The only filter operation supported for resources is `eq`.
- When provisioning a new team, Sentry will both normalize and convert the team `displayName` uppercase to lowercase, and convert spaces to dashes.
- The GET /Groups endpoint will return a maximum of 10000 members in a group, see [SCIM API documentation](/api/scim/) for more information.
