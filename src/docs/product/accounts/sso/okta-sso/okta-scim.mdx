### Requirements

Okta SCIM provisioning requires:

- A subscription to Sentry Business Plan or higher.
- Configuration of SAML SSO for Okta [as documented here](/product/accounts/sso/okta-sso/), or use the Okta sign-on tab in your Sentry Okta application to configure SAML.
- **Selection of Email for the Application username format** in the Sign On application tab in Okta.

### Sentry Configuration

1. Sign in to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io). Select **Settings > Auth**
   ![Sentry Okta SCIM Auth Page](../scim-settings-auth.png)
1. Under General Settings select "Enable SCIM", then "Save Settings"
   ![Sentry Enable SCIM Instruction](../scim-enable-sentry.png)
   Sentry will display "SCIM Information" that contains your Auth Token and SCIM Base URL.

### Okta Configuration

1. Sign in to your Okta organization with your administrator account. From the admin console's sidebar, select Applications > Applications, then select the existing Sentry application.

1. Select the "Provisioning" tab, then "Configure API integration".
   ![Okta configure SCIM API](scim-okta-configure.png)

1. Select "Enable API Integration", enter the SCIM URL from the auth settings page as the Base URL field. For the API Token, copy the Auth Token value from the auth settings page.

1. Select "Test API Credentials", and confirm the message "the app was verified successfully" displays.

1. Select "Save" to be directed to SCIM App settings.

1. On the Provisioning page, select "To App", then "edit":
   ![Okta Save SCIM Settings](scim-okta-edit.png)

1. Enable both "Create Users" and "Deactivate Users", then "Save" your changes.
    ![Okta Create and Deactivate Users](okta-user-sync.png)

As a result of these changes, users who are assigned will be sent an invitation email. When a user is un-assigned, their membership object in Sentry will be deleted.

You can use "Push Groups" to sync and assign groups in Okta; they will be reflected in Sentry teams.

### Configuring organization-level roles (Beta)

<Alert level="warning">

Organization role provisioning is in beta. If you'd like to try this feature, contact support@sentry.io.

</Alert>

Here's how to assign an organization-level role to an Okta group:

1. Add a new custom attribute to your Okta application profile.

  a. Navigate to your application settings in Okta

  b. Under the "Provisioning" tab, select "Go to Profile Editor"
        ![Okta Provisioning Page](okta-go-to-profile.png)

  c. Select "+ Add Attribute"
        ![Okta Add Attribute](okta-add-attribute.png)

  d. Fill out the form with the following settings (you can set whatever value you want for any setting not listed below):

    * Data Type: `string`
    * Display Name: `Org Role`
    * Variable Name: `sentryOrgRole`
    * External name: `sentryOrgRole`
    * External namespace: `urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User`
    * Attribute type: `Group`
  ![Okta Custom Attribute](./okta-custom-attribute-values.png)


2. Assign a group to your okta application
    ![Okta Assign Group](okta-assign-group.png)

3. In the form, enter the string for the org-level role
    ![Okta Set Role](okta-set-group-attribute.png)

- If the `sentryOrgField` field is left blank, Group members will be provisioned with the default organization-level role. This default role is configured in Sentry, under Settings -> Organization -> Auth. Otherwise, the role must be one of the following:
  - Admin
  - Manager
  - Billing
  - Member
- Invalid role names will prevent group members from being provisioned. To try again, you'll need to remove the group first.
- For security, The "Owner" role cannot be provisioned through SCIM.
  - For self-hosted users with custom roles, this extends to any role with the `org:admin` permission

<Alert level="note">

If a user is a member of multiple Okta groups, only the attributes set by the first group will be used.

</Alert>

### Troubleshooting

#### I get an error in Okta when provisioning a user saying "Matching user not found"

Make sure that `Create User` and `Deactivate User` are enabled in the "Provisioning" tab of your Sentry application in Okta

#### I pushed a group to Sentry but the team is empty. (Or) I assigned Sentry to a group but no team was created?

In Okta, there's a difference between pushing and assigning.

Assigning Sentry to a group is the same as assigning Sentry to every member of that group. Functionally, this
provisions every group member within Sentry.

Pushing a group, on the other hand, only tells Sentry to create a new team with the same name as the Okta group. Group
members will be added to the Sentry team only if the user is already provisioned.

In order to sync a group in Okta as a team in Sentry:
1. Assign Sentry to the Group and allow the users to be provisioned
2. Push the Group to Sentry

### Known Issues

- The Import Users feature is not currently supported. Sentry's SCIM API does not at this time support the User `name` attribute fields `firstName` and `lastName`. Instead, we return these with values of `N/A` for compatibility purposes.
- Setting `active` to `false` on a User will delete the organization member record associated with the user.
- The only filter operation supported for resources is `eq`.
- When provisioning a new team, Sentry will both normalize and convert the team `displayName` uppercase to lowercase, and convert spaces to dashes.
- The GET /Groups endpoint will return a maximum of 10000 members in a group, see [SCIM API documentation](/api/scim/) for more information.
