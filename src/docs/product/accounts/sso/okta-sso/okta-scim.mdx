### Okta Configuration

1. Sign in to your Okta organization with your administrator account. From the admin console's sidebar, select Applications > Applications, then select the existing Sentry application.

1. Select the "Provisioning" tab, then "Configure API integration".
   ![Okta configure SCIM API](scim-okta-configure.png)

1. Select "Enable API Integration", enter the SCIM URL from the auth settings page as the Base URL field. For the API Token, copy the Auth Token value from the auth settings page.

1. Select "Test API Credentials", and confirm the message "the app was verified successfully" displays.

1. Select "Save" to be directed to SCIM App settings.

1. On the Provisioning page, select "To App", then "edit":
   ![Okta Save SCIM Settings](scim-okta-edit.png)

1. Enable both "Create Users" and "Deactivate Users", then "Save" your changes.

As a result of these changes, users who are assigned will be sent an invitation email. When a user is un-assigned, their membership object in Sentry will be deleted.

You can use "Push Groups" to sync and assign groups in Okta; they will be reflected in Sentry teams.

### Configuring organization-level roles (Limited Availability)

<Alert level="note">

Organization role provisioning is in limited availability. If you wish to try this feature out, contact support@sentry.io

</Alert>

You can assign an organization-level role to an okta group

1. Add a new custom attribute to your Okta application profile

a. Navigate your your application settings in Okta

b. Under the "Provisioning" tab, select "Go to Profile Editor"

c. Select "+ Add Attribute"

d. Fill out the form with the following settings

    - Data Type: `string`
    - External name: `sentryOrgRole`
    - External namespace: `urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User`
    - Attribute type: `Group`

2. Assign a group to your okta application

3. In the form, type out the role you want every member of the group to be.

- Group members will be provisioned with the organization default role if the field is left blank
- Invalid role names will prevent group members from being provisioned. To try again, you'll need to remove the group first.
- For security, roles with the `org:admin` permission scope cannot my provisioned through SCIM.

<Alert level="note">

If a user is a member of multiple okta groups, only the attributes set by the first group will be used for the user.

</Alert>

### Known Issues / Troubleshooting

- Sentry does not currently support setting any User attributes other than `userName` and `active`.
- The Import Users feature is not currently supported. Sentry's SCIM API does not at this time support the User `name` attribute fields `firstName` and `lastName`. Instead, we return these with values of `N/A` for compatibility purposes.
- Setting `active` to `false` on a User will delete the organization member record associated with the user.
- The only filter operation supported for resources is `eq`.
- When provisioning a new team, Sentry will both normalize and convert the team `displayName` uppercase to lowercase, and convert spaces to dashes.
- The GET /Groups endpoint will return a maximum of 10000 members in a group, see [SCIM API documentation](/api/scim/) for more information.
