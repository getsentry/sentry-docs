## Installation

1. Log in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Under "Manage Azure Active Directory" (the picture of the shield), click "View". This takes you to the **Organization Overview** page.

1. If you don't require a permission group for Sentry, skip to Step 5.

1. In the search bar, search for "Groups" then navigate to it. From there, create a new group, add an owner and members to the group. Set "Group type" to Office 365. For more details about group creation, see the [Azure docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-groups-create-azure-portal).

1. Return to the **Overview** page. In the search bar, enter `Enterprise Applications` and navigate to it. Click "+ New application". Search for `Sentry` to create the application for Sentry.

1. Paste the App Federation Metadata URL from above and click "Get Metadata".

1. In the next page, enter the following keys in their respective fields to map the attributes from AzureAD to Sentry, and then save them.

    - IdP User ID: `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/name`

    - User Email: `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress`

    - First Name: `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/givenname`

    - Last Name: `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/surname`

1. Sentry will attempt to authenticate and link your account with Azure. After successful authentication, you'll be redirected to Sentry's SSO configuration page, where you can take the following actions:

   - You can share the "Login URL" value, which will be used for SP-initiated SSO, with the users in your organization.
   
   - Scroll down to the bottom and ensure that "Require SSO" is checked if you want to enforce logging in with Okta.
   
   - Set a "Default Role" for new SSO users. Selecting "Member" should cover most use-cases.
   
   - If you made changes, click "Save Settings" to complete your setup.
