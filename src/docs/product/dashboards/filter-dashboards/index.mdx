Once you've created a dashboard, you can filter the information displayed in different ways.

## Global Selection Header

You can specify which projects, environments, and date range you want to zoom in on at the top of the page. This can also be found in other parts of [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) as a top-level filter.

## Filter by Interactive Graph

Time Series visualizations have an interactive graph that allows you to zoom in.
To zoom in, click and drag over the area you want to investigate.
