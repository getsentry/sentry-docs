<Note>

Dashboards are available only if you're in the Early Adopter program. Features available to Early Adopters are still in progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.

If you’re interested in being an Early Adopter, you can turn your organization’s Early Adopter status on/off in General Settings. This will affect all users in your organization and can be turned back off just as easily.

</Note>

Dashboards provide the ability to build custom views of your application's health, including the ability to navigate issues and performance across multiple projects. Dashboards are made up of one or more widgets, and each widget visualizes one or more [Discover queries](/product/discover-queries/).

You can filter the information that's displayed in a dashboard in different ways:

- Global Selection Header: Specify which projects, environments, and date range you want to zoom in on at the top of the page. This can also be found in other parts of [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) as a top-level filter.
- Interactive Graphs: Use the interactive graph function of time series visualizations to zoom in. To do this, click and drag over the area you want to investigate.

Dashboards are shared across users of your organization, and you can customize them, as required. For more information, see [Customize Dashboards](/product/dashboards/customize-dashboards/).
