You can adjust your personal [workflow](#workflow) and [deploy](#deploy) notifications, as well as your personal issue alert settings, in your [account settings](https://sentry.io/settings/account/notifications/). Manage your notifications by navigating to **User Settings > Notifications**. You **cannot configure** quota notifications.

## Alerts

<Note>

This setting does not affect alerts that are configured to send to your email explicitly.

</Note>

In **Notifications**, you can toggle [issue alert](/product/alerts/alert-types/#issue-alerts) notifications on and off, globally.

You can also fine tune your alert notifications on a per-project basis by choosing "Default”, “On”, or “Off”. If you select “Default”, the setting for the project will be the same as your global setting.

### Delivery Method

<Note>

This feature is available only if you're in the Early Adopter program. Features available to Early Adopters are still in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony. If you’re interested in being an Early Adopter, you can turn your organization’s Early Adopter status on/off in General Settings. This will affect all users in your organization and can be turned back off just as easily.

Let us know if you have feedback: [ecosystem-feedback@sentry.io](mailto:ecosystem-feedback@sentry.io).

</Note>

You can decide where you receive personal alert notifications by choosing from the options:
- Send to Email
- Send to [Slack](/product/integrations/notification-incidents/slack/)
- Send to Email and Slack


[Slack](/product/integrations/notification-incidents/slack/) is only available as a delivery method if your organization has the integration installed and your [Slack identity is linked to your Sentry account](/product/integrations/notification-incidents/slack/#linking-your-slack-and-sentry-accounts).

## Workflow

The global settings for workflow notifications are:

- Always
- Only On Issues I Subscribe To
- Never

You can fine tune your workflow notifications on a per-project basis by choosing one of the three options above or "Default”. If you select “Default”, the setting for the project will be the same as your global setting.

## Email Routing

Email routing controls the email address to which your notifications are sent for each project. These notifications default to the email address you provided when you set up your Sentry account. This setting allows you to route emails to an alternative email address on a per-project basis.

## Weekly Reports

Reports contain a summary of your organization's Sentry activity over the last week. You can fine tune your weekly reports by turning reports on or off for each organization.

## Deploy

The global settings for deploy notifications are:

- On
- Only On Deploys With My Commits
- Off

You can fine tune your deploy notifications on a per-organization basis by choosing one of the three options above or "Default”. If you select “Default”, the setting for the organization will be the same as your global setting.
