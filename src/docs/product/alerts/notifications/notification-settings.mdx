You can adjust your personal [workflow](#workflow) and [deploy](#deploy) notifications, as well as your personal issue alert settings, in your [account settings](https://sentry.io/settings/account/notifications/). Manage your notifications by navigating to **User Settings > Notifications**. You **cannot configure** quota notifications.

## Alerts

<Note>

This setting does not affect alerts that are configured to send to your email explicitly.

</Note>

In **Notifications**, you can toggle [issue alert](/product/alerts/alert-types/#issue-alerts) notifications on and off, globally.

You can also fine tune your alert notifications on a per-project basis by choosing "Default”, “On”, or “Off”. If you select “Default”, the setting for the project will be the same as your global setting.

## Workflow

The global settings for workflow notifications are:

- Always
- Only On Issues I Subscribe To
- Never

You can fine tune your workflow notifications on a per-project basis by choosing one of the three options above or "Default”. If you select “Default”, the setting for the project will be the same as your global setting.

### Unsubscribe

To opt out of workflow notifications for a specific issue, click the subscribe bell icon at the top of the issue’s page.

## Email Routing

Email routing controls the email address to which your notifications are sent for each project. These notifications default to the email address you provided when you set up your Sentry account. This setting allows you to route emails to an alternative email address on a per-project basis.

## Weekly Reports

Reports contain a summary of your organization's Sentry activity over the last week. You can fine tune your weekly reports by turning reports on or off for each organization.

## Deploy

The global settings for deploy notifications are:

- On
- Only On Deploys With My Commits
- Off

You can fine tune your deploy notifications on a per-organization basis by choosing one of the three options above or "Default”. If you select “Default”, the setting for the organization will be the same as your global setting.

## My Activity
Use the toggles to control whether or not you receive notifications about:

- Your actions while using [sentry.io](https://sentry.io)
- Any changes on unclaimed issues you've resolved
