Sentry sends you notifications regarding workflow activities, [release deploys](/product/releases/), and [quota usage](/product/accounts/quotas/), as well as weekly reports. These notifications let you know about:

- [Workflow](#workflow-notifications): Activity involving user actions and state changes on issues. This includes activities such as issue resolution, assignment, comments, and regressions.
- [Deploy](#deploy-notifications): When a release you have commits on is deployed.
- [Quota](#quota-notifications): Approaching quotas, exceeded quotas, and spike protection.
- [Weekly Reports](#weekly-reports): A summary of your organization's Sentry activity.

You can manage these notifications in **User Settings > Notifications**.

## Workflow Notifications

Sentry sends workflow notifications to let you know about [issue state](/product/issues/states-triage/) changes. Workflow relates to actions that help you manage your issues, such as changing an issue’s state or commenting on it. By default, Sentry sends these notifications by email to members who are subscribed to the issue (see below for how subscription is determined). Workflow notifications are sent for:

- **Issue Resolved**: When a new issue is spotted in your code, it's in the Unresolved state. The issue state changes to Resolved when a project team member resolves it, either by manually changing its state in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io)) or by submitting a fix, or because of the project’s auto-resolve feature (if configured).
- **Regressions**: A regression happens when the state of an issue changes from Resolved back to Unresolved. An email is sent to all project team members.
- **Comments**: When a team member adds a new comment in the “Activity” tab of the detail page for the issue.
- **Assignment**: When an issue is assigned or unassigned.
- **User feedback**: When an issue has new user feedback. <!--add link here when the product side user feedback content is created-->
- **Processing Issue**: <!-- what does this mean even? -->

You receive workflow notifications when you’re subscribed to an issue, and you subscribe to issues by:

- Clicking the subscribe bell icon on an issue
- Involvement in a commit related to the issue
- Commenting on or bookmarking the issue
- Mention of you or your team in the issue
- You or your team being assigned to the issue

These notifications may have some overlap with alerts that are configured for a project.

## Deploy Notifications

Sentry sends deploy notifications to users who have committed to the release that was deployed. Learn more in the [deploy documentation](/product/releases/setup/#notify-sentry).

## Quota Notifications

Sentry sends quota notifications to all owners of an organization when:

- 80% of the organization's error volume has been depleted **and** there is a projected overage for the billing period. If it’s not projected that your account will go over quota before the end of the billing period, you won’t receive this notification.
- Errors or transactions have exceeded the organization's quota, which includes on-demand capacity

You cannot change or disable these notifications. Learn more in the [full Quotas documentation](/product/accounts/quotas/).

## Weekly Reports
Sentry sends weekly reports every Monday, by email. Reports contain a summary of your organization's Sentry activity over the last week.

## Personal Notification Settings

You can adjust your personal [workflow](#workflow) and [deploy](#deploy) notifications, as well as your personal issue alert settings, in your [account settings](https://sentry.io/settings/account/notifications/). Manage your notifications by navigating to **User Settings > Notifications**. You **cannot configure** quota notifications.

### Alerts

<Note>

This setting does not affect alerts that are configured to send to your email explicitly.

</Note>

In **Notifications**, you can toggle [issue alert](/product/alerts/alert-types/#issue-alerts) notifications on and off, globally.

You can also fine tune your alert notifications on a per-project basis by choosing "Default”, “On”, or “Off”. If you select “Default”, the setting for the project will be the same as your global setting.

### Workflow

The global settings for workflow notifications are:

- Always
- Only On Issues I Subscribe To
- Never

You can fine tune your workflow notifications on a per-project basis by choosing one of the three options above or "Default”. If you select “Default”, the setting for the project will be the same as your global setting.

#### Unsubscribe

To opt out of workflow notifications for a specific issue, click the subscribe bell icon at the top of the issue’s page.

### Email Routing

Email routing controls the email address to which your notifications are sent for each project. These notifications default to the email address you provided when you set up your Sentry account. This setting allows you to route emails to an alternative email address on a per-project basis.

### Weekly Reports

Reports contain a summary of your organization's Sentry activity over the last week. You can fine tune your weekly reports by turning reports on or off for each organization.

### Deploy

The global settings for deploy notifications are:

- On
- Only On Deploys With My Commits
- Off

You can fine tune your deploy notifications on a per-organization basis by choosing one of the three options above or "Default”. If you select “Default”, the setting for the organization will be the same as your global setting.

### My Activity
Use the toggles to control whether or not you receive notifications about:

- Your actions while using [sentry.io](https://sentry.io)
- Any changes on unclaimed issues you've resolved
