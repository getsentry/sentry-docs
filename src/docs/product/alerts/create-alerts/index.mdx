<Note>

The minimum role required to create alerts is member. Sentry users with manager or owner permissions can change the minimum role requirement in **Settings > General Settings > Let Members Create and Edit Alerts**.

</Note>

To create alerts:
1. Navigate to **Alerts** and click "Create Alert Rule".
1. Select your project.
1. Choose what you want to be alerted about. Selecting “Issues” creates an [issue alert](/product/alerts/alert-types/#issue-alerts), while selecting any other option creates a [metric alert](/product/alerts/alert-types/#metric-alerts).

1. Click "Set Conditions".
1. On the alert configuration page, set the conditions of the alert:
    - [Issue Alert Configuration](/product/alerts/create-alerts/issue-alert-config/)
    - [Metric Alert Configuration](/product/alerts/create-alerts/metric-alert-config/)


# Duplicate Alerts

<Note>

  This feature is available only if you're in the Early Adopter program. Features available to Early Adopters are still in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.

  If you’re interested in being an Early Adopter, you can turn your organization’s Early Adopter status on/off in General Settings. This will affect all users in your organization and can be turned back off just as easily.

</Note>

Duplicating alerts works similarly to creating and editing alerts. If the user has the role requirements for creating and editing alerts, they can also duplicate alerts. Users can duplicate both issue and metric alert rules.

To duplicate alerts:
1. Navigate to **Alerts** and click the context menu on the row with the alert rule you want to copy.
1. Click "Duplicate" this will navigate you to the create new alert page with all fields initialized with values from the duplicated alert.
1. Edit the values of the new alert rule to be created.
1. Click "Save Rule" and this will redirect you to the newly created alert rule's detils page.
