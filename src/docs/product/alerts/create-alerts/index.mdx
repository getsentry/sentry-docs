To create alerts:
1. Navigate to **Alerts** and click "Create Alert Rule".
1. Select your project.
1. Choose what you want to be alerted about.

![Choice between alerts about Errors, Performance, or a Custom Metric](sentry-basics/guides/alerts-notifications/create-new-alert-rule.png)

Selecting “Issues” creates an [issue alert](alert-type-page); selecting any other option creates a [metric alert](alert-type-page). These are:
 - Number of Errors
 - Users Experiencing Errors
 - Throughput
 - Transaction Duration
 - Apdex
 - Failure Rate
 - Largest Contentful Display
 - First Input Delay
 - Cumulative Layout Shift
 - Custom Metric

You can also choose to create a custom metric.
1. Click "Set Conditions".
1. On the alert configuration page, set the conditions of the alert. Learn more about each configuration option in the full [Issue Alert Configuration](link) and [Metric Alert Configuration](link) documentation.
