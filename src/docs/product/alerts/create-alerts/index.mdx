To create alerts:
1. Navigate to **Alerts** and click "Create Alert Rule".
1. Select your project.
1. Choose what you want to be alerted about. Selecting “Issues” creates an [issue alert](/product/alerts/alert-types/#issue-alerts), while selecting any other option creates a [metric alert](/product/alerts/alert-types/#metric-alerts).
