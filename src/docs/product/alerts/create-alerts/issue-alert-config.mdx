---

Sentry provides several configuration options to create an issue alert based on your organization's needs.

## Environment

Specify which <PlatformLink to="/configuration/environments/">environment(s)</PlatformLink> will use this particular alert rule. This control filters on the `environment` tag in your events. This filter is helpful because the urgency and workflows you apply to production alerts might differ from those you apply to alerts originating from your QA environment, for example.

The “Environment” dropdown list here has the same environments that are available for the selected project in the global “Environment” dropdown (this does not include hidden environments). Selecting "All Environments" is equivalent to having no environment filter.

## Team

You can choose a team to associate with an alert so that members of that team can edit the alert. Note that you can only make this association if you are a member of the team. If no team is selected, anyone can edit the alert.

## Alert Name

Give your alert a descriptive name, such as the team affected and the topic of the alert. For example, "Frontend Latency", "Backend Failure Rate", or "Billing Apdex".

## "When" Conditions: Triggers

"When" conditions, or triggers, specify what type of activity you'd like monitored for the issue:

- First seen
- Changes state from `resolved` to `unresolved`
- Changes state from `ignored` to `unresolved`
- Seen more than a certain number of times in an interval
- Seen by more than a certain number of unique users in an interval
- An issue affects more than {X} percent of [sessions](/product/releases/health/#session) in {time}. This is an approximation and will trigger when the ratio of the issue’s frequency to the number of sessions exceeds the threshold.

<Note>

The "percent of sessions" alert trigger is available only if you're in the Early Adopter program. Features available to Early Adopters are still in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.

If you’re interested in being an Early Adopter, you can turn your organization’s Early Adopter status on/off in General Settings. This will affect all users in your organization and can be turned back off just as easily.

</Note>

Triggers are optional. If you don’t select a trigger, the "When" conditions are considered met by default. That is, _all_ issues will meet this condition.

Learn more about issue states in [Issue States & Triage](/product/issues/states-triage/).

## "If" Conditions: Filters

Sentry checks "if conditions", or filters, after “When” conditions are met, and these help control noise by filtering out issues that don’t match your specified criteria. You can filter on issue or event properties. If an event filter is specified, it checks only the event that triggered the alert, such as:

- The issue is older or newer than a certain duration.
- The issue has happened at least {X} times.
- The issue is assigned to {no one/a team/a member}.
- The event is from the latest release.
- The event's {attribute} {matches} {value}. Match types: equals, does not equal, starts with, ends with, contains, does not contain, is set, or is not set.
- The event's {tag} {matches} {value}. Match types: equals, does not equal, starts with, ends with, contains, does not contain, is set, or is not set.
- The event's level {matches} {level}. Match types: equal to, less than or equal to, or greater than or equal to.

## “Then” Conditions: Actions

"Then conditions", or actions, specify what should happen when trigger and filter conditions are met:

- Send a notification to either [Issue Owners](/product/error-monitoring/issue-owners/), a team, or a member.
- Send a notification to an integration, which can include these options, depending on which integrations you have installed:
  - Send a [Slack](/product/integrations/notification-incidents/slack/) notification
  - Send a [PagerDuty](/product/integrations/notification-incidents/pagerduty/) notification
  - Send a [Microsoft Teams](/product/integrations/notification-incidents/msteams/) notification
  - Send a notification to all legacy integrations.
  - Send a notification using an [integration](/product/integrations/) built on the [Integration Platform](/product/integrations/integration-platform/)
- Create an issue for an [integration](/product/integrations/), which includes:
  - [Jira](/product/integrations/jira/)
  - [Azure DevOps](/product/integrations/azure-devops)

Learn more about [routing alerts with integrations](/product/alerts/create-alerts/routing-alerts/).

### Issue Owners

[Issue owners](/product/issues/issue-owners/) can receive notifications (emails only) when an alert is triggered. If an issue owner is not configured or not found, either the email notification won’t be sent or it’ll be sent to all project members, depending on the following setting in **[Project] > Settings > Issue Owners**.

## Action Interval (Rate Limit)

The action interval, or rate limit, controls how often the alert rule can be triggered for a particular issue. If alert conditions match an issue, Sentry executes the actions only if they haven't already been executed for that issue within the rate limit period. For example, if an issue meets alert conditions multiple times in a one-minute period, but your frequency threshold is one minute, you’ll only be alerted once.

The available intervals are:

- Minutes: 5, 10, 30, 60
- Hours: 3, 12, 24
- Days: 7, 30

## Project-Level Alert Settings

In **[Project] > Settings > Alerts**, you can configure alert email subject templates and digest settings. Sentry users with owner, manager, or admin permissions and above can change these default notification settings.

### Digests

The digests feature only works for issue alert emails (not notifications sent through integrations), and unlike the [action interval](#action-interval-rate-limit), limits the total number of alert emails sent for the project. This project-level setting allows you to control the minimum and maximum delivery intervals for alerts.
