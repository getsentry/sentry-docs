Sentry provides several configuration options to create a metric alert based on your organization's needs.

## Filters

The following set of filters translates into a [Discover query](/product/discover-queries/) that is displayed in the chart at the top of the alert configuration page.

### Environment

Specify which <PlatformLink to="/configuration/environments/">environment(s)</PlatformLink> will use this particular alert rule. This control filters on the `environment` tag in your events. This filter is helpful because the urgency and workflows you apply to production alerts might differ from those you apply to alerts originating from your QA environment, for example.

The “Env:” dropdown list here has the same environments that are available for the selected project in the global “Environment” dropdown (this does not include hidden environments). Selecting "All" is equivalent to having no environment filter.

### Event Type

For some metric alerts, you can set the event type that you want to be alerted about in the “Events” dropdown:

- `event.type:error` OR `event.type:default`
- `event.type:default`
- `event.type:error`
- `event.type:transaction`

### Tags & Attributes

Add filters in the field provided to narrow down what you'll be alerted about, such as URL, tags, or other event properties.

## Metric (Function + Time Interval)

Depending on the type of alert you’ve selected, you may be able to choose functions and parameters to apply to it. In other cases, the function is built into the alert and the settings aren't displayed. For example, if you select “Number of Users Affected”, that translates to the function, `count_unique(user.id)`. Since editing this function would change the nature of the alert, it is not editable and thus hidden.

### Functions for Alerting

- `count()`
- `count_unique(...)`
- `avg(...)`
- `percentile(...)`
- `failure_rate()`
- `apdex(...)`
- `count()`
- `p50()`
- `p75()`
- `p95()`
- `p99()`
- `p100()`

### Time Interval

Choose the time period over which to evaluate your metric. Your choices range between one minute and one day. Sentry evaluates the specified window each minute. For example, if you specify an hour time window, Sentry evaluates:

- At 3:00pm: 2:00pm - 3:00pm
- At 3:01pm: 2:01pm - 3:01pm
- At 3:02pm: 2:02pm - 3:02pm
- ...

## Thresholds

There are two threshold types:

- Count: a fixed threshold such as when there’s 100 errors in a period of time.
- Percent change: a dynamic threshold such as when there’s 10% more errors in this time period compared to a previous period. These are also referred to as Change Alerts.

By default, alerts use a fixed threshold.

### Change Alerts (Percent change)

<Note>
This feature is available only if your organization is on either a Business or Trial plan.
</Note>

Percent change thresholds are useful when you want to know if the metric is significantly different from normal. To do this, you’ll need to set the time period to compare to. One example could be comparing the number of errors in the last hour to the same time period 1 week ago. If errors jump by 25% in the last hour then an alert will trigger.

### Set Threshold to Trigger Alert

You can set the status of an alert rule when a threshold is met, such as:

- Critical
- Warning
- Resolved

You must set the “Warning” threshold so that it’s triggered before the “Critical” threshold. When Sentry evaluates an alert, the alert’s status is updated to the highest severity trigger that matches. If you don’t set a “Resolved” threshold, the alert automatically resolves when it's no longer breaching the “Critical” or “Warning” conditions. You can also resolve alerts manually.

### Auto-Resolve

By default, metric alerts are resolved automatically when the specified metric is no longer breaching the “Critical” or “Warning” conditions. However, you can set a different resolution threshold. For example, suppose a normal level of errors for your app is less than 2000/minute, and you want to be alerted when that exceeds 5000/minute. You might want the alert to resolve only if the level of errors goes back below 2000/minute, not 5000/minute. By setting the "Resolved" threshold this way, if the error level comes back down to only 4000/minute, which you’d consider problematic even though it’s below your alert threshold, the alert won't resolve.

## Actions

Actions define how you and your team will be alerted:

- Send an email to a member or team. If sent to a member, the member's personal project alert opt-out settings are overridden.
- Send a [Slack](/product/integrations/notification-incidents/slack/) notification.
- Trigger a [PagerDuty](/product/integrations/notification-incidents/pagerduty/) incident.
- Send a [Microsoft Teams](/product/integrations/notification-incidents/msteams/) notification.
- Send a request using [internal integrations](/product/integrations/integration-platform/#internal-integrations).

## Rule Name

Give your alert a descriptive name, such as the team affected and the topic of the alert. For example, "Frontend Latency", "Backend Failure Rate", or "Billing Apdex".

## Team

You can choose a team to associate with an alert so that members of that team can edit this alert. Note that you can only make this association if you are a member of the team. If no team is selected, anybody can edit the alert.
