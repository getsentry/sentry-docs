It’s really important that alerts notify the right people at the right time. Sending too many notifications to too many people risks having those notifications ignored. The following best practices will help you create or fine tune your alerts to minimize noise, while still telling you what you need to know.

## Detecting Important Problems

**Frequency**: Generally, you set alerts to trigger when errors exceed a certain frequency, but frequency isn't everything: a low-frequency error can be more important than a high-frequency one if it's in a more important part of your app.

**Users affected**: Sometimes a very small number of users create lots of errors, so alerting on users affected can be more important than error frequency. However, not all errors that have user counts in Sentry may be actually user-facing, and vice versa. If you filter these types of issues, you avoid being alerted to errors that are not user facing.

**Tags**: Use tags to categorize errors. For example, you can filter on the automatically captured `url` tag to identify business-critical pages, or filter on a custom tag like `customer_type` to treat those alerts with more importance. You can find the list of tags available in your project under **[Project] > Settings > Tags**. The list is an aggregation of all tag keys (default and custom) encountered in events for that project.

## Reducing Noise

<Note>

These best practices help you reduce the noise that can be generated by issue alerts, and do not apply to metric alerts.

</Note>

**Seeing the same alerts**: If you're repeatedly seeing alerts you've seen before, try filtering your issue alerts to issues created in the last few days, using the `The issue is older or newer than...` filter.

**Transient alerts**: To filter out transient issues that happen only a few times in quick succession, and never again, use the `Issue has happened at least {X} times` filter in your issue alert.

**Limit to latest release**: Use the `The event is from the latest release` filter to apply your issue alert only to the latest release.

**Use the “For Review” list**: New issues and issues becoming unresolved are typically something you want to know about, but they can generate a lot of noise. Sentry's [“For Review” tab](/product/issues/states-triage/#mark-reviewed) in the issue list surfaces these issues so you can use email and integrations for higher urgency alerts, while ensuring these low-urgency issues don’t slip through the cracks. We recommend reviewing the "For Review" list once a day. This list surfaces:

- New issues
- Regressions (issue changes state from Resolved -> Unresolved)
- Issues that have met their ignore conditions (issue changes state from Ignored -> Unresolved)

### Ignored Issues

You can ignore issues to reduce noise, however, ignored issues won't trigger an alert when alert conditions are met; they instead become unresolved and appear in the [“For Review” list](/product/issues/states-triage/#mark-reviewed). So if you're worried about missing these issues, create an issue alert using the `An issue changes state from ignored to unresolved` trigger.

## Routing

**Issue owners**: Use [issue owners](/product/issues/issue-owners/) to let Sentry automatically send alerts to the right people, as well as to ease configuration burden. You can configure ownership rules in **[Project] > Settings > Issue Owners**. When there are no matching owners, the alert goes to all project members by default. If this is too broad, and you'd like a specific owner to be the fallback, end your ownership rules with a rule like `*:<owner>`.

**Delivery methods for different priorities**: Use different delivery methods to separate alerts of different priorities. For example, you might route from highest to lowest priority like so:

- High priority: Page (PagerDuty or OpsGenie)
- Medium priority: Chat app (Slack)
- Low priority: Email

The “For Review” tab in the issue list is where you can check on your lowest priority issues without receiving any alerts.

**Build an integration**: If you would like to route alert notifications to solutions with which Sentry doesn't yet have an out-of-the-box integration, you can use our [Integration Platform](/product/integrations/integration-platform/). When you create an integration, it will be available in the alert actions menu. You might want use your own integration for:

- Sending alerts to integrations not supported natively
- Aggregating alerts from your different monitoring systems
- Writing custom rules in the webhook handler to route alerts more intelligently
