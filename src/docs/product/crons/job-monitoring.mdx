Sentry's Cron Monitoring service can notify you and store a timeline of the following check-in events:

- **Missed check-in:** The job didn't execute in the predicted timeframe or frequency. This can happen for various reasons, such as:
  - The job scheduler is misconfigured, skipped, or failed to initiate your job.
  - A timeout failure event when a job sent an initial check-in but failed to send a final check-in.
  - Network issues, such as an outbound firewall or an unstable connection.
  - An invalid request format.
- **Failed check-in:** The job has reported its execution as unsuccessful.
- **Successful check-in:** The job has reported its execution as successful.

To see information about your cron monitor, select "Crons" from the sidebar menu and click on your cron monitor's name.

## Cron Monitor Details

This is where you'll find a daily historical bar chart showing successful, failed, and missed check-ins and a line chart of the runtime average for the job execution.

The "Issues" section shows the issues created from this Cron Monitor. Issues are created when a cron monitor job execution is missed or failed. If you have configured the Sentry SDK for your job, any errors thrown during the job runtime will be shown here as well.

The table of recent check-ins lists previously scheduled jobs and their statuses.

## Multiple Environments

To monitor the same job in different environments, use a shared schedule to send check-ins for multiple environments to one monitor. Each environment will have its own status and set of check-ins.

### Alerting on Specific Environments

To only receive failing or missed monitor alerts for a specific environment or set of environments, [configure the
environment](/product/alerts/create-alerts/issue-alert-config/#environment) for
your monitor alert.

### Existing Limitations:

- It's not currently possible to pause an individual monitor environment.

- It's not currently possible to see an aggregate view of a monitors' status
  across all environments. Each environment will appear as its own row in the
  monitor list.

- Currently, only entire monitors can be removed. Individual monitor environments can't be deleted.

## Pausing Your Cron Monitor

You can pause job monitoring in the header of your cron monitor. When you pause, your monitor will stop recording check-ins and will no longer notify you of any failed or missed check-ins.

Note: Pausing your cron monitor won't pause the execution of your job or change the configuration of your job scheduler.
