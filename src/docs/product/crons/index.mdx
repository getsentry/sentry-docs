With Crons, Sentry helps you maintain your jobs' uptime and performance, delivering alerts and metrics to help you solve errors, detect timeouts, and prevent disruptions to your service.

What are some good use cases of Crons?

- An invoice generation job, where it is critical for each job run to complete successfully and in a timely manner with a predefined scheduled interval and frequency.
- A server cleanup tool, where each job execution must not exceed a pre-defined runtime threshold.
- Any other standalone unit of execution with a finite input.

This step-by-step tutorial walks you through setting up a crons monitoring service. After completing this tutorial, you'll be able to receive alerts if your job fails to run at its scheduled time or doesn't execute successfully.

To use Crons, you must have an existing Sentry account and project. Don't have a Sentry account? Create an account here.
