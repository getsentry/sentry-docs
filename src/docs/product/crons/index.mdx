Sentry Cron Monitoring is currently in open beta and subject to change. Help us make Crons better by letting us know what you think. Respond on [GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/discussions/42283) or write to us at crons-feedback@sentry.io.

</Alert>

Cron Monitors allows you to monitor the uptime and performance of any scheduled, recurring job in Sentry. Once implemented, it'll allow you to get alerts and metrics to help you solve errors, detect timeouts, and prevent disruptions to your service.

## Example Use Cases

- An invoice generation job, where it's critical for each job run to complete successfully and in a timely manner with a predefined, scheduled, interval and frequency.
- A server cleanup tool, where each job execution must not exceed a pre-defined runtime threshold.
- Any other standalone unit of execution with a finite input.

This step-by-step tutorial walks you through setting up a cron monitoring service. After completing this tutorial, you'll be able to receive alerts if your job fails to run at its scheduled time or doesn't execute successfully.

To use Crons, you must have an existing Sentry account and Project set up. If you don't have one, [Create an account here](https://sentry.io/signup/).
