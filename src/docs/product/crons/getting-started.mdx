## Step 1: Create a Cron monitor

Sentry Crons allows you to monitor any job running on a scheduled interval. To get started, first create a new crons monitoring service for one of your projects:

1. First, access the Crons product area by clicking “Crons” in the sidebar.
2. From here, click the "Set Up Cron Monitor" button.
3. Select a project to which you'd like your crons to be attached. The project selected is where any issues in your job execution will be created.
4. Name your job, for example, "Generate daily invoices".
5. [add remainings inputs here]
6. Click on save at the bottom of the page to proceed to the next step.
7. Save your Crons project ID and project DSN, you'll need these later.

## Step 2: Set up health checks

Sentry monitors your job status via regular health checks emitted from your application. A health check constitutes two (2) HTTP "check-in" requests: an initial check-in emitted before the start of your job execution, and a final check-in emitted after your job completes.

Initial check-in
To set up your health checks, you must first execute an initial check-in HTTP POST request to the following endpoint:

```bash
$ curl -X POST \
    'https://sentry.io/api/0/monitors/9d47c17f-9f9d-42b0-9792-499bdf732624/checkins/' \
    --header 'Authorization: DSN {DSN}' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data-raw '{"status": "in_progress"}'
```

`CRONS_ID`:

: Required. The Crons ID is provided in the previous cron monitor creation step.

`PROJECT_DSN`:

: Required. The Project DSN is provided after you create your first cron monitor, and it can also be found on your project's configuration page.

Upon an initial check-in, you will receive a response with a unique identifier for your check-in. Save this ID in your job runtime context to be utilized later:

Final check-in (Required)
After completion of your job, execute a final check-in HTTP PUT request defining it as either a success or failed check-in with the following body:

```bash
$ curl -X PUT \
    'https://sentry.io/api/0/monitors/9d47c17f-9f9d-42b0-9792-499bdf732624/checkins/{checkInId}/' \
    --header 'Authorization: DSN {DSN}' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data-raw '{"status": "ok", "duration": 3000}'
```

`CHECK_IN_ID`:

: Required. The check-in ID is provided in the response to the initial check-in.

`STATUS`:

: Required. The status of your job execution, if it was completed successfully or unsuccessfully. Values accepted are success or failure.

`DURATION`:

: Recommended. The runtime of the job in milliseconds.

Once these health checks are set up, your cron monitor is ready to observe and report on future scheduled job executions.
