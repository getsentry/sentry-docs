## Cron Monitor Isn't Notifying Me of Failures

If your cron monitor isn't sending any notifications, make sure that your alert rule is set up with the appropriate [filters](/product/crons/alerts/#step-1-set-filters) and [alert rule actions](/product/alerts/create-alerts/issue-alert-config/#then-conditions-actions).
