Sentry Crons allows you to monitor the uptime and performance of any scheduled, recurring job. Once implemented, it'll allow you to get alerts and metrics to help you solve errors, detect timeouts, and prevent disruptions to your service.

## Requirements

To begin monitoring your recurring, scheduled job:

- [Install](/product/cli/installation) and [configure](/product/cli/configuration) the Sentry CLI.
    - The authorization token provided requires the `project:write` scope.
- [Create and configure](https://sentry.io/crons/create/) your first Monitor.

## Job Monitoring

Use the Sentry CLI to run your job and notify you if it doesn't start when expected (missed) or if it exceeded its maximum runtime (failed).

```bash {tabTitle: CLI}
sentry-cli monitors run <monitor_id> -- <command> <args>
```

Usage examples:

```bash {tabTitle: Python}
sentry-cli monitors run 63261d96-2027-472a-a8bb-9895dbebd793 -- python path/to/file.py
```

```bash {tabTitle: Node.JS}
sentry-cli monitors run 63261d96-2027-472a-a8bb-9895dbebd793 -- node path/to/file.js
```
