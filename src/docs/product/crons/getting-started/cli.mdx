<Alert level="note" title="Deprecation Notice">

Starting with v2.16.1 of the Sentry CLI, the ability to monitor check-ins using an auth token for authorization has been deprecated. Read on to learn how to update your CLI and use your project's DSN instead.

</Alert>

Sentry Crons allows you to monitor the uptime and performance of any scheduled, recurring job. Once implemented, it'll allow you to get alerts and metrics to help you solve errors, detect timeouts, and prevent disruptions to your service.

## Requirements

To begin monitoring your recurring, scheduled job:

- [Install](/product/cli/installation) the Sentry CLI (min v2.16.1).
- [Create and configure](https://sentry.io/crons/create/) your first Monitor.

## Configuration

The Sentry CLI uses your Monitor's project DSN to authorize check-ins. To set it up, export the `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable:

<SignInNote />

```bash
export SENTRY_DSN=___PUBLIC_DSN___
```

Alternatively, you can add it to your `~/.sentryclirc` config:

<SignInNote />

```ini {filename:~/.sentryclirc}
[auth]
dsn = ___PUBLIC_DSN___
```

Learn more about the CLI's [configuration file](/product/cli/configuration#configuration-file).

## Job Monitoring

Use the Sentry CLI to run your job and notify you if it doesn't start when expected (missed) or if it exceeded its maximum runtime (failed).

```bash {tabTitle: CLI}
sentry-cli monitors run <monitor_slug> -- <command> <args>
```

Usage examples:

```bash {tabTitle: Python}
sentry-cli monitors run my-monitor-slug -- python path/to/file.py
```

```bash {tabTitle: Node.JS}
sentry-cli monitors run my-monitor-slug -- node path/to/file.js
```

### Specifying Monitor Environments (Optional)

If your cron monitor runs in multiple environments you can use the `-e` flag to specify which [Monitor Environment](/product/crons/job-monitoring/#multiple-environments) to send check-ins to.

```bash {tabTitle: Node.JS}
sentry-cli monitors run -e dev my-monitor-slug -- node path/to/file.js
```
