To set up Sentry Crons, use the links below for supported SDKs or use the Sentry CLI. After set up, you'll be able to receive alerts if your job fails to run at its scheduled time or doesn't execute successfully.


## Supported SDKs

- [PHP](/platforms/php/crons/)
  - [Laravel](/platforms/php/guides/laravel/crons/)
- [Python](/platforms/python/crons/)
  - [Celery](/platforms/python/guides/celery/crons/)

<Alert level="note" title="Don't see your platform?">

We are are working on enabling additional platforms for Crons. Meanwhile, you can use the Sentry CLI or via HTTP to set up monitoring for your jobs.
