description: Learn about reprocessing errors with new debug files and source maps.
---

Sentry uses [debug information
files](/platforms/native/data-management/debug-files/) or
[source maps](/platforms/javascript/sourcemaps/) only after they have been uploaded. _Reprocessing_ allows you to apply source maps and debug information files to error events that have already occurred.

<Note>

This feature is available only if you're in the Early Adopter program. Features available to Early Adopters are still in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.
If you’re interested in being an Early Adopter, you can turn your organization’s Early Adopter status on/off in General Settings. This will affect all users in your organization and can be turned back off just as easily.

</Note>

After becoming an Early Adopter, you will find a new button when viewing an issue:

!["Reprocess this issue" button next to Resolve, Ignore, Share, Delete actions in issue details page](reprocessing-btn.png)

The dialog requires two answers:

* _How many events to reprocess_ -- When left empty, all events are reprocessed
  and potentially move to other (new or existing) issues if the stack trace
  changed significantly. If you provide a number, for example, 20, then the 20 most recent events are
  reprocessed, and any remaining events are left as-is.

* _What to do with remaining events_ -- If you choose to reprocess, for example, only 20
  events out of 100, you can choose what happens to the remaining 80 events.
  The default is to keep them where they are (the issue you're viewing).
  Alternately, you may choose to delete them.

After pressing _Reprocess Events_, **the issue will be locked and hidden from
your issue stream while reprocessing is ongoing**. As data is migrated between
issues we allow no actions, such as resolving or assigning the issue, to ensure
data consistency and avoid data loss.

Note that you can still get to the issue manually by searching for
`is:reprocessing` (removing all other search terms) to get around those
restrictions if you have to.

## Caveats

The dialog to start reprocessing notes a few caveats that you
should be aware of and understand prior to kicking off reprocessing.

* **Data glitches.** During reprocessing you may observe temporary data
  inconsistencies across the entire product. You may observe an event belong to
  two issues at once, and appear in Discover queries twice.

  Those inconsistencies disappear the moment reprocessing is complete. However,
  depending on your platform and the amount of events involved, reprocessing may take a
  while.

* **Attachment storage needs to be enabled.** If your events come from
  minidumps or unreal crash reports, you must have [attachment
  storage](/platforms/native/enriching-events/attachments/#crash-reports-and-privacy)
  enabled. **If the original minidump no longer exists in Sentry, sending an
  event through reprocessing will cause it to have no stack trace at all.**

* **Quota applies.** Every event you choose to reprocess will count against
  your plan's quota a second time. Rate limits and spike protection do not
  apply.

* **Debug files don't apply immediately.** When uploading debug information
  files, regardless of whether you upload to your own symbol server or to Sentry, the debug information files are
  applied only one hour after internal caches have expired. Please wait
  at least an hour after uploading DIFs before reprocessing.

* **Alerts do not apply, with caveats.** Issue alerts do not trigger for
  reprocessed events, and the new events are not subject to data forwarding.

  Metric alerts generally do not trigger either; however, they are subject to the
  aforementioned data inconsistencies. If you have created a metric alert with
  a 24-hour measurement window, and an event you reprocess happened in the last
  24 hours, it will temporarily be counted twice while events are reprocessing.
  This may trigger a metric alert.

## Legacy Reprocessing

Sentry can suspend incoming crash reports until all required debug information
files have been uploaded. **This feature is also called Reprocessing.** It can
be configured in _Project Settings > Processing Issues_. By default, this
feature is disabled.

If enabled, crash reports with missing debug files will not be displayed in the
issues stream. Instead, you will receive a warning that events cannot be
processed until all debug files have been uploaded.

We do not recommend enabling this project setting as it does not work properly with minidumps or
Unreal crash reports. Reprocessing existing issues as shown above replaces this functionality.
