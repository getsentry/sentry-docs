Sentry provides several methods to filter data in your project. Using sentry.io to filter events is a simple method since you don't have to <PlatformLink to="/configuration/filtering/">configure and deploy your SDK to filter projects</PlatformLink>.

### Inbound Data Filters

Inbound data filters allow you to determine which errors, if any, Sentry should ignore. Explore these by navigating to **[Project] » Project Settings » Inbound Filters.**

Inbound filters include:

- Common browser extension errors
- Events coming from localhost
- Known legacy browsers errors
- Known web crawlers
- By their error message
- From specific release versions of your code
- From certain IP addresses

Once applied, you can track the filtered events (numbers and cause) using the graph provided at the top of the Inbound Data Filters view.
