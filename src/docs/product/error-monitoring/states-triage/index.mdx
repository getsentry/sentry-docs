An issue can be in one of three states:

1. Unresolved: The default state for all new issues.
2. Ignored: The issue is ignored permanently or until a condition is met to move it to a state of Unignored. [Issue alerts](/product/alerts-notifications/issue-alerts/) are suppressed for ignored issues.
3. Resolved: The issue is resolved because it was fixed. You can also mark an issue as Resolved if you don't expect it to happen again.

The "For Review" tab, or Review List, of the Issues page displays issues when any of the following happens:

- A new issue is created; it's labeled "New Issue"
- A resolved issue re-occurs; it's labeled "Regression"
- An ignored issue meets its ignore conditions; it's labeled "Unignored"

For-review issues are a subset of all unresolved issues.

## Issue Triage

Triaging is the act of deciding what action you want to take on an issue. It typically involves one or more of these actions.

### Assign

You can assign issues to teams or individuals. In a multi-team environment, routing issues to the right people usually starts with assigning it to the right team, which further assigns it to the right member of the team. [Ownership rules](/product/error-monitoring/issue-owners/) allow you to define rules for which teams or individuals should own an issue. You might also see a list of suggested assignees including the owners of suspect commits.

TO DO Confirm meaning in first sentence; does someone have to manually do this reassigning to a team member after it gets assigned to a team?

### Link

Create an issue in an external project management tool like Jira that tracks the Sentry issue, or link an existing one. [Two-way sync](/product/sentry-basics/guides/getting-started/#33-issue-tracking) is available for some tools. Issues linked using [global integrations](/product/integrations/integration-platform/#public-integrations) or [internal integrations](/product/integrations/integration-platform/#internal-integrations) are searchable using the terms `is:linked` and `is:unlinked`.

### Mark Reviewed

Mark the issue as reviewed and [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) removes the reason label (the issue stays in the Unresolved state). Unlike ignoring an issue, this is a way to acknowledge an issue that you intend to fix at some point. This is only available on issues flagged for review)

Note that resolving or ignoring an issue implicitly marks the issue reviewed.

To keep your Review List fresh, [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) automatically marks issues as reviewed if they remain untouched in the list for seven days.

### Resolve

Resolve an issue when it's fixed or you don't expect it to happen again. You can do this manually or by [including the issue ID in a commit](/product/integrations/gitlab/#resolve-via-commit-or-pull-request).

### Ignore

Ignore an issue **permanently** (the default action when you press the button) if it's just noise and you'll likely never care about it. Or ignore it until a condition is met (at which point it becomes Unresolved and flagged for review). You can also set an issue to Ignore if you're working on the issue if you don't want to keep getting alerts.

### Delete

Delete an issue to remove it from the system. A new issue is created if a new instance of the issue (a new event) occurs.

### Delete and Discard

Delete and discard an issue to remove it from the system. A new issue is not created even if a new instance of the issue (a new event) occurs.

<Note>

The Auto Resolve setting defines the amount of time an issue can go without being seen again (that is, no new events on that issue) before it's automatically resolved. To check if this has been defined for a project, go to **[Project] > Settings > General Settings** and check the Event Settings section.

</Note>

While you can work to have zero unresolved issues ("Inbox Zero") by resolving or ignoring all issues, this usually isn't feasible for any non-trivial production application. However, it is feasible to have zero for-review issues by triaging the Review List. We recommend triaging these issues once a day to keep your issues manageable.


TO DO Figure out a home for these pieces of search information (if at all)
- `assigned:X` returns issues assigned to X
- `assigned_or_suggested:X` returns issues assigned to X, or where X is an owner determined by ownership rules, or where X is a [suspect committer](product/releases/suspect-commits/)
