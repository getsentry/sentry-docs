The Issues page is where you can find information about important groups of errors in your application. Filter by properties such as browser, device, impacted users, or whether the error is unhandled. You can then inspect issue details to better understand the problem and [triage](/product/error-monitoring/issue-details/) effectively.

## Error Events and Issues

A typical application sends a large number of events to Sentry. To make them manageable, we group similar events into issues based on the event stack trace and other information. You can think of an issue as a single bug or problem with your app. This grouping of events into issues allows you to see how frequently a problem is happening and how many users it's affecting. With this information, you can then make decisions about what to do.

From the Issues page, you can begin to triage an issue. Learn more about triaging issues and their different states in [Issue States and Triage](/product/error-monitoring/states-triage/).

For each issue, the page displays:

- Error type and message
- Brief description of the issue
- Associated project
- Issue timing, such as last and first time seen
