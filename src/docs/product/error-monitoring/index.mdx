Sentry's Error Monitoring features are enabled when you [configure your SDK](/error-reporting/configuration/). To take advantage of all the monitoring features in Sentry, learn how to use the data provided:

- [Dashboards](/product/error-monitoring/dashboards/): Sentry's Dashboards help you gain detailed perspectives of your application's health by providing filtering tools to navigate your issues across multiple projects in a single view. Dashboards are available if you're on a Business plan or a Trial.

- [Issue Ownership Rules](/product/error-monitoring/issue-owners/): Rules for Issue Ownership help you decide which user or team should own an issue, resembling a typical code owners file in a repository. Learn how to automatically assign issues to their respective owners, or alert the owners about the issue, allowing you to find the developer with the most context about a fix.
