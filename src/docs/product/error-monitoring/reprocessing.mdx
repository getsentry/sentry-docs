Sentry can suspend incoming crash reports until all required debug information
files have been uploaded. This feature is called _Reprocessing_. It can be
configured in _Project Settings > Processing Issues_. By default, this feature
is disabled.

If enabled, crash reports with missing debug files will not be displayed in the
issues stream. Instead, you will receive a warning that events cannot be
processed until all debug files have been uploaded.

Once an issue is shown in the issues stream, it is no longer processed. Even
with enabled reprocessing, new file uploads will not effect such events.

At the moment, this feature only applies to iOS crashes sent with the Cocoa SDK
and is not compatible with Symbol Servers.
