If you don't already have performance monitoring enabled, use the link below to quickly set up access to our [Performance Monitoring](/product/performance/) features. Performance Monitoring helps you see everything from macro-level [metrics](/product/performance/metrics/) to micro-level [spans](/product/performance/event-detail/), and you'll be able to cross-reference [transactions with related issues](/product/performance/transaction-summary/), customize [queries](/product/discover-queries/query-builder/) based on your personal needs, and substantially more.

<Alert>

Customers on legacy plans must add transaction events to their subscription in order to access our performance monitoring features. For general questions about performance monitoring with Sentry and for information about how you can add transactions to your plan, please contact [support@sentry.io](mailto:support@sentry.io). To start a performance monitoring trial and for information on volume pricing, please contact [sales@sentry.io](mailto:sales@sentry.io).
