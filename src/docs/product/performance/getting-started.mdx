After this quick setup, you'll have access to [Performance](/product/performance/). This tool will empower you to see everything from macro-level [metrics](/product/performance/metrics/) to micro-level [spans](/product/performance/event-detail/), but you'll be able to cross-reference [transactions with related issues](/performance-monitoring/performance/transaction-summary/), customize [queries](/product/discover-queries/query-builder/) based on your personal needs, and substantially more.
