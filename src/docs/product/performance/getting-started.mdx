After this quick setup, you'll have access to [Performance](/product/performance/). This tool will empower you to see everything from macro-level [metrics](/product/performance/metrics/) to micro-level [spans](/product/performance/event-detail/), but you'll be able to cross-reference [transactions with related issues](/product/performance/transaction-summary/), customize [queries](/product/discover-queries/query-builder/) based on your personal needs, and substantially more.

Sentry's Performance features are now generally available. Customers on any of our legacy plans will need to add transaction events to their subscription to access Performance. For more details about access to these features, feel free to reach out at [performance-feedback@sentry.io](mailto:performance-feedback@sentry.io).
