description: "Get started with Sentry's Performance Monitoring. This quick setup will empower you to see everything from macro-level metrics to micro-level spans, and you'll be able to cross-reference transactions with related issues and customize queries."

If you don't already have performance monitoring enabled, use the link below to quickly set up access to our [Performance Monitoring](/product/performance/) features. Performance Monitoring helps you see everything from macro-level [metrics](/product/performance/metrics/) to micro-level [spans](/product/performance/event-detail/), and you'll be able to cross-reference [transactions with related issues](/product/performance/transaction-summary/), customize [queries](/product/discover-queries/query-builder/) based on your personal needs, and substantially more.

<Alert>

Customers on any of our legacy plans will need to add transaction events to their subscription to access our performance monitoring features. For more details about access to these features, feel free to reach out at [performance-feedback@sentry.io](mailto:performance-feedback@sentry.io).
