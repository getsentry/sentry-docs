Every transaction has a summary view that gives you a better understanding of its overall health. With this view, you'll find graphs, instances of these events, stats, facet maps, related errors, and more.

## Overview

### Filter and Search

While you can use the search field to narrow down your events, you can also filter by http, db, browser, and resource by toggling between operations in the "Filter" menu. This filtering is reflected in the rest of the page, which provides you with more targeted drill-downs.

### Graphs

- **Duration Breakdown:** By graphing [P50](/product/performance/metrics/#p50-threshold), [P75](/product/performance/metrics/#p75-threshold), [P95](/product/performance/metrics/#p95-threshold), [P99](/product/performance/metrics/#p99-threshold), and P100 durations distinctly, you can utilize this display to see their transaction performance over time. Toggle the display of each segment by clicking on the legend (including Releases). Also, zoom in on specific slices to investigate spikes or possible performance regressions from a release.

- **Latency Histogram:** Visualize the frequency of transactions that occur within each response time segment. This histogram view can help you understand the shape of transaction response times and quickly see outliers. Click on specific segments to drill down for more granularity.

- **Duration Percentiles:** This graph shows the [average transaction duration](/product/performance/metrics/#average-transaction-duration) across distinct percentiles. For example, see how different the P50 and P99 response time durations are for a given transaction and understand the rate of increase between segments.

- **Trends:** This graph uses a modified version of [ASAP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.00983.pdf) smoothing. The Trends graph shows the unsmoothed data of the Display data, along with a smoothed version of that data.

- **Web Vitals:** This graph displays the [P75 threshold](/product/performance/metrics/#p75-threshold) of [First Paint](/product/performance/web-vitals/#first-paint-fp), [First Contentful Paint](/product/performance/web-vitals/#first-contentful-paint-fcp), [Largest Contentful Paint](/product/performance/web-vitals/#largest-contentful-paint-lcp), and [First Input Delay](/product/performance/web-vitals/#first-input-delay-fid) over time. This view helps you understand how the web vitals associated with the transaction are performing over time.

### Transaction Table

On initial load, the table displays slow occurrences of the transaction along with the Event ID, User, [Operations Breakdown](/product/sentry-basics/tracing/event-detail/#operations-breakdown), Total Transaction Duration, and Timestamp of the event. Click on the Event ID to open the [event detail](/product/sentry-basics/tracing/event-detail/) or the Trace ID to view the [full trace](/product/sentry-basics/tracing/trace-view). Other sets of transactions you can browse through are below.

- Fastest Transactions
- Slow Transactions (p95)
- Outlier Transactions (p100)
- Recent Transactions

The table also updates dynamically if you change any of the selections in the global header or when you drill in on a latency segment (applicable when viewing the Latency Histogram).

When viewing transactions, you may want to create more curated views. Click "Open in Discover" above the table to create a custom query to investigate further. For more details, see the full documentation for the Discover [Query Builder](/product/discover-queries/query-builder/).

_Note_: Currently, only transaction data - the transaction name and any attributes the transaction inherits from its root span - is searchable. Data contained in spans other than the root span is not indexed and therefore cannot be searched.

### Suspect Tags

<Note>

This feature is available only if you're in the Early Adopter program. Features available to Early Adopters are still in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.

If you’re interested in being an Early Adopter, you can turn your organization’s Early Adopter status on/off in General Settings. This will affect all users in your organization and can be turned back off just as easily.

</Note>

The transaction summary includes a list of suspect tags that often correspond to slower transactions. By default, we sort tags by the total time lost. The list includes additional information:

- **Tag Key**: The tag category (for example, device, geo)
- **Tag Value**: The specific tag value (for example, Android, South America)
- **Avg (Tag) Duration**: Provides the average duration for a transaction with this tag
- **Comparison to Avg**: Indicates how much slower or faster this tag is than the average duration of this transaction
- **Total Time Lost**: Calculates how much total time you've lost in the selected time range when comparing the average tag duration to the average transaction duration

To investigate why these tags are affecting performance, click on the tag value to filter the transaction summary further.

### Related Issues

This table will show you all related issues. In other words, any errors that are associated with this transaction. Click "Open in Issues" to see the full list.

### Sidebar

The sidebar contains helpful supplementary information about this transaction's [User Misery](/product/performance/metrics/#user-misery), [Apdex](/product/performance/metrics/#apdex), [Throughput](/product/performance/metrics/#throughput-total-tpm-tps), [Latency](/product/performance/metrics/#latency), and more. You'll also find a Tag Summary (facet map) for a list of common tags related to this transaction.


## Web Vitals

Frontend transactions will have a "Web Vitals" tab. Clicking on the tab will take you to the [Web Vitals page](/product/performance/web-vitals), where you can see a detailed view of the web vitals associated with this transaction.

This feature is available only if you're in the Early Adopter program. Features available to Early Adopters are still in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony. If you’re interested in being an Early Adopter, you can turn your organization’s Early Adopter status on/off in General Settings. This will affect all users in your organization and can be turned back off just as easily.

</Note>

The **Tags** tab displays a list of suspect tag keys that often correspond to slower transactions. Toggle through them to have the corresponding tag values reflected in the heat map. Similar to a histogram, events are distributed by duration. Click on any purple box to view a list of events or continue to filter down the events by adding values to the filter in the table below the heat map.

</Note>

The table in **All Events** tab offers a full list of transactions broken down similar to the abbreviated table in the overview. Filters are carried across from other views. You can also narrow the events down by percentile.

## Additional Actions

### Starring Key Transactions

If you find an important transaction you want to return to, click "Star for Team" in the upper right corner and mark it as a key transaction for any of your teams. This will be saved so you can view this from your [Performance Homepage](/product/performance/). The key transactions you mark will be shared with members of the same team and each team can have up to 100 key transactions.

### Creating Alerts
To create a metric alert rule for this transaction, click [Create Alert](/product/alerts-notifications/metric-alerts/) at the top of the page.
