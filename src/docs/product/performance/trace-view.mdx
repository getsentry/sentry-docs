<Note>

This feature is available only if you're in the Early Adopter program. Features available to Early Adopters are still in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.

If you’re interested in being an Early Adopter, you can turn your organization’s Early Adopter status on/off in General Settings. This will affect all users in your organization and can be turned back off just as easily.

</Note>

From Performance, Issues, and Discover, you can drill down into a single [trace](/product/performance/distributed-tracing) and traverse all of the transactions in that trace. This will accelerate your ability to debug slow services, identify related errors, and root out other bottlenecks.

Currently, the trace view will only show up to 100 transactions from the trace. Additional transactions can be found through [Discover](/product/discover-queries).

## Trace View

The trace view provides a split view. On the left, you can view the trace's transaction tree. On the right, you can view a representation of each transaction as a colored rectangle. The first row lists the trace itself, with all other spans descending from that trace.

You can display these views from:
- [Transaction Summary](/product/performance/transaction-summary/): Select the [Performance Homepage](/product/performance/), the affected transaction, then click a trace ID.
- [Event Details](/product/performance/event-detail/): Click the trace ID beneath the quick trace on the top right.
- [Issue Details](/product/issues/issue-details/): Click "View Full Trace" above the quick trace.
- [Query Builder](/product/discover-queries/query-builder/): Build a query with the trace column, then click a trace ID in the table.

Trace IDs are linked to the corresponding Trace Detail.

## Transaction Details

Clicking a transaction row expands the details of that transaction to view many of the attached properties, such as tags and other field data. With the transaction name, you can view the [Transaction Summary](/product/performance/transaction-summary/) of that transaction across traces. Click "View Summary" to see that summary. As well with the transaction ID, you can see the [event details](/product/performance/event-detail/) of that transaction by clicking on "View Transaction".

## Troubleshooting

### Orphan Traces and Broken Subtraces
In a fully instrumented system, a span in one service will connect to a transaction in a subsequent service. For a variety of reasons, a transaction in a service may not arrive in Sentry. When Sentry encounters these types of transactions within a trace, we link the transactions with a dashed line since they can no longer be directly connected to the root.

Broken subtraces may be caused by:
- [Ad blockers](/platforms/javascript/troubleshooting/#dealing-with-ad-blockers) may prevent transactions in browsers being sent, but HTTP requests to backend projects will still create child transactions
- [Rate-limiting](/product/accounts/quotas/#limiting-events) on a project may cause only some events to be sent to Sentry
- [Project permissions](/product/accounts/membership/#restricting-access) may mean you do not have access to transactions in another project

### Multiple Roots

Each trace ID should have only one root, a transaction without any parents. Included instrumentation should prevent multiple roots; however, if the trace ID of your transactions are being set using custom instrumentation, you may encounter multiple roots.
