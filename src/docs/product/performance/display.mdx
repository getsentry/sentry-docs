The Display dropdown automatically selects a set of [metrics](../metrics/) and table columns based on the platform of your project. For example, a JavaScript project defaults to Display: Frontend (Pageload). You can change the Display selection, but some modes may not be applicable to the platform.

### Display: All

Display: All mode shows [Apdex](../metrics/#apdex) and [TPM](../metrics/#throughput-total-tpm-tps). You can configure the Apdex threshold in **Settings > Performance**.

### Display: Frontend (Pageload)

Display: Frontend (Pageload) mode shows [Web Vitals](../web-vitals/) and LCP information. Additionally, transactions are automatically filtered by `transaction.op:pageload`. This generally corresponds to all browser page transitions that are not handled internally in SPA frameworks, such as React or Vue.

### Display: Frontend (Other)

Display: Frontend (Other) mode shows duration information. Additionally, transactions are automatically filtered by `transaction.op:!pageload`. This generally corresponds to page transitions handled internally in SPA frameworks, such as React or Vue. Note that if you've selected a backend project, this mode also displays backend transactions.

### Display: Backend

Display: Backend mode shows duration, throughput, failure rate, and Apdex information. You can configure the Apdex threshold in **Settings > Performance**. Note that if you've selected a frontend project, this mode also displays frontend non-pageload transactions.
