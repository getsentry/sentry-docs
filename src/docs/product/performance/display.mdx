The Display dropdown automatically selects a set of [metrics](../metrics/) and table columns based on the platform of your project. For example, a JavaScript project defaults to Display to Frontend (Pageload). You can change the Display, but some modes may not be applicable as they do not apply to the platform.

### Display: All

Display: All mode shows [Apdex](product/performance/metrics/#apdex) and [TPM](/product/performance/metrics/#throughput-total-tpm-tps). The Apdex threshold can be configured in **[Project] > Settings**.

### Display: Frontend (Pageload)

In Display: Frontend (Pageload) mode, [Web Vitals](../web-vitals/) and LCP information are shown. Additionally, transactions are automatically filtered by `transaction.op:pageload`. This generally corresponds to all browser page transitions that are not handled internally in SPA frameworks, such as React or Vue.

### Display: Frontend (Other)

In Display: Frontend (Other) mode, duration information is shown. Additionally, transactions are automatically filtered by `transaction.op:!pageload`. This generally corresponds to page transitions handled internally in SPA frameworks, such as React or Vue. Note that if a backend project is selected, this mode will also display backend transactions.

### Display: Backend

In Display: Backend mode, duration, throughput, failure rate, and Apdex information is shown. The Apdex threshold can be configured in the **[Project] > Settings**.  Note that if a frontend project is selected, this mode will also display frontend non-pageload transactions.
