The Display dropdown automatically selects a set of [metrics](metrics/) and table columns based on the platform of the selected project. For example, selecting a JavaScript project will set the Display to Frontend (Pageload). You can also manually change the Display, but note that some modes may not be applicable. For example, the Web Vitals shown in Frontend (Pageload) mode only reflect pageload transactions.

### Display: All

In Display: All mode, Apdex and TPM are shown. The Apdex threshold can be configured in the project settings.

### Display: Frontend (Pageload)

In Display: Frontend (Pageload) mode, [web vitals](web-vitals/) and LCP information are shown. Additionally, transactions are automatically filtered by `transaction.op:pageload`. This generally corresponds to all browser page transitions that are not handled internally in SPA frameworks such as React or Vue.

### Display: Frontend (Other)

In Display: Frontend (Other) mode, duration information is shown. Additionally, transactions are automatically filtered by `transaction.op:!pageload`. This generally corresponds to page transitions handled internally in SPA frameworks such as React or Vue. Note that if a backend project is selected, this mode will also display backend transactions.

### Display: Backend

In Display: Backend mode, duration, throughput, failure rate, and apdex information is shown. The Apdex threshold can be configured in the project settings.  Note that if a frontend project is selected, this mode will also display frontend non-pageload transactions.
