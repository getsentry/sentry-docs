Mobile Vitals are a set of metrics to measure how fast your app starts, the duration of HTTP requests, the number of slow and frozen frames, how fast your views are loading, and more. Each data point provides insights into the overall performance of your mobile application.

These metrics, as a core part of Sentry's performance monitoring, give you the details you need to not only prioritize critical performance issues but trace the issue down to the root cause to solve them faster.

These vitals are summarized in several graphs for a quick overview of how each transaction is performing for your users.

## App Start

App start metrics provide insight into how long your application takes to launch. The SDKs app start instrumentation adds a span from the app launch to the first auto-generated UI transaction or adds spans for different phases, depending on the platform. To track app starts, Sentry measures *cold starts* and *warm starts*.

- **Cold Start**: A cold start refers to when the app launches for the first time, after a reboot or update. The app is not in memory and no process exists.
- **Warm Start**: A warm start refers to when the app has already launched at least once and is partially in memory. For instance: The user backs out of your app, but then re-launches it. The process may have continued to run, but the app must recreate the activity from scratch.

On iOS, Apple recommends your app take at most 400ms to render the first frame. On Android, the [Google Play console](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/vitals/launch-time#av) warns you when a cold start takes longer than 5 seconds or a warm start longer than 2 seconds.

The exact definitions differ slightly per platform. For more details, so please check out our [iOS](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/apple/guides/ios/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/) and [Android](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/apple/guides/ios/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/) docs.
The SDKs differentiate between a cold and a warm start and don't track hot starts/resumes.

## Slow and Frozen Frames

To track the responsiveness of the UI, Sentry measures *slow frames* and *frozen frames*.  Typically, a phone or tablet renders 60 frames per second (fps). At 60 fps, every frame has 16.67 ms to render.

- **Slow Frames**: Slow frames refer to when the app takes more than 16 ms (Android) or 16.67 ms (iOS) to render a frame.
- **Frozen Frames**: Frozen frames are frames that take longer than 700 ms to render.

The frame rate can also be higher, especially as 120 fps displays are becoming more popular.
