description: "Performance Monitoring helps you to see everything from macro-level metrics to micro-level spans, and you'll be able to cross-reference transactions with related issues, and customize queries."
---

The Performance Monitoring homepage is the main view where you can search or browse for transaction data. Filter by search conditions or choose from a list of sortable transactions in the table. As soon as a transaction of interest has been rooted out, you can investigate further by clicking it for its [summary view](/product/performance/transaction-summary/).

## Filter by Search Conditions

The search bar operates similarly to the one in the Discover [Query Builder](/product/discover-queries/query-builder/#filter-by-search-conditions). For example, you can refine your transaction search to a specific release by using `release:` as a key field and assigning the version as a value.

## Display Filter

A display filter can be found next to the search bar. This  automatically selects a set of [metrics](/product/performance/metrics/) and table columns based on the platform of your project. For example, a JavaScript project defaults to a Frontend (Pageload) display. You can change the selected display, but some modes may not be applicable to the platform.

### All Transactions

All Transactions will be selected by default. The table will include all frontend and backend transactions.

### Frontend (Pageload)

Frontend (Pageload) puts an emphasis on [Web Vitals](/product/performance/web-vitals/). The transactions are automatically filtered to only include `transaction.op:pageload`. This generally corresponds to all browser page transitions that are not handled internally in SPA frameworks, such as React or Vue.

### Frontend (Other)

Frontend (Other) includes any other frontend transaction that is not a pageload. The filter `transaction.op:!pageload` automatically gets added. This generally corresponds to page transitions handled internally in SPA frameworks, such as React or Vue. Note that if you've selected a backend project, this mode also displays backend transactions.

### Backend

Backend puts an emphasis on duration, throughput, failure rate, and Apdex. Note that if you've selected a frontend project, this mode also displays frontend non-pageload transactions.

## Graphs

Compare graphs side by side to find any relevant correlations. For example, if an Apdex score dips significantly during a given time period, you'll be able to visualize whether throughput spiked in the same time interval. The global header and search conditions will also enable you to filter these graphs even more. The display options are listed below:

- [Apdex](/product/performance/metrics/#apdex)
- [Transactions Per Minute (TPM)](/product/performance/metrics/#throughput-total-tpm-tps)
- [Failure Rate](/product/performance/metrics/#failure-rate)
- [p50 Duration](/product/performance/metrics/#p50-threshold)
- [p95 Duration](/product/performance/metrics/#p95-threshold)
- [p99 Duration](/product/performance/metrics/#p99-threshold)

## Transaction Table

Below the graphs are a table of transactions that may be filtered down based on global header and search condition filters. The [Display Filter](/product/performance/#display-filter) will automatically set what appears in the table columns. Here are a few of the common columns shown in the tables.

- Transaction Name
- Project
- Operation
- [TPM](/product/performance/metrics/#throughput-total-tpm-tps)
- [P50](/product/performance/metrics/#average-transaction-duration)
- [P95](/product/performance/metrics/#p95-threshold)
- [Failure Rate](/product/performance/metrics/#failure-rate)
- [Apdex](/product/performance/metrics/#apdex)
- Unique Users
- [User Misery](/product/performance/metrics/#user-misery)

If you have transactions you frequently return to, you can mark up to 10 transactions as a key transaction by clicking the star in the corresponding row. Clicking the star ensures that these key transactions are always surfaced to the top of the list. You can also mark a transaction as a key transaction in its corresponding [summary view](/product/performance/transaction-summary/#key-transaction).
