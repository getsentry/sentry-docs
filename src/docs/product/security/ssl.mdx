Sentry's API, dashboard, and event submission require a minimum TLS version of 1.2 to communicate securely.

Sentry provides a suite of protocols and ciphers that focus on giving our users a balance of security and compatibility. Our servers will negotiate a cipher to the most secure combination the client can support in the preferential order specified below. The set of ciphers depends on the endpoint and negotiated TLS version.

### sentry.io and \*.ingest.sentry.io

TLS versions 1.2 and 1.3 are supported for both Sentry's API, dashboard, and legacy event submission (via `sentry.io`), and for event ingestion domains (via `*.ingest.sentry.io`).

Supported ciphers:

#### TLS 1.3

- TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
- TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
- TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256

#### TLS 1.2

- TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
- TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
- TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
- TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
- TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
- TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
- TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
- TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
- TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
- TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA

This suite of protocols and ciphers represents Sentry's official support; however, clients may experience an agreement on individual ciphers that exceed the strength ratings of those listed above.

## Certificate Pinning

At the moment, Sentry uses Digicert and Let's Encrypt as certificate authorities for all TLS certificates. If this needs to be changed, we will publish an announcement on [status.sentry.io](https://status.sentry.io/).

Here are corresponding root CA certificates if you would like to pin them in your applications:
