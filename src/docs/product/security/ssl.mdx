Sentry's API, Dashboard, and Event Submission requires a minimum TLS version of 1.0 to communicate securely.

By the end of February, 2021, Sentry's API and Dashboard will require a minimum TLS version of 1.2.

Sentry provides a suite of protocols and ciphers that focus on giving our users a balance of security and compatibility. Our servers will negotiate a cipher to the most secure combination the client can support in the following preferential order:

- TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
- TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
- TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
- TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
- TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
- TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
- TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
- TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
- TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA

This suite of protocols and ciphers represents Sentry's official support; however, clients may experience an agreement on individual ciphers that exceed the strength ratings of those listed above.
