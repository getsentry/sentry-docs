By default, Relay logs errors to the configured logger. You can enable error
reporting to your project in Sentry in the Relay configuration file:

```yaml
sentry:
  enabled: true
  dsn: <your_dsn>
```

## Configuration

Stats can be submitted to a StatsD server by configuring the `metrics` key. The key
can be set to an `ip:port` tuple:

```yaml
metrics:
  statsd: 127.0.0.1:8126
  prefix: mycompany.relay
```

`statsd`

: Configures the host and port of the StatsD client. We recommend running a
  StatsD client on the same host as Relay for performance reasons.

`prefix`

: Configures a prefix that is prepended to all reported metrics. By default, all
  metrics are reported with a `"sentry.relay"` prefix.

`hostname_tag`

: Adds a tag of the given name and sets it to the hostname of the machine that
  is running Relay. This configuration is useful to separate multiple Relays. For example, setting this to:

  ```yaml
  metrics:
    hostname_tag: pod_name
  ```

  The above example adds a `"pod_name"` tag set to the host name for
  every metric.

## Metrics

Relay emits the following metrics:
