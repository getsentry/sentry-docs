Sentry uses a minimalist approach to documentation. Our docs have one goal: help customers gain mastery _quickly_. Minimalism in documentation puts the reader at the center of the content. Our audience is reading the documentation to solve a problem or finalize a setup or to understand. Thus, think **very critically** about the content that is provided, especially on a primary page.

## Use This Test

Ask these questions as you're developing content:

- Is this information critical to helping a developer get up and running? If not, consider moving it to a subpage with a link to it from the primary page (or, as suggested by one of our engineering managers, "cool, I can bookmark this for later").

- Is this obvious from the UI? Our UI is largely self-documenting, so we don't need to explain what's already evident.

## What Goes Where?

Our content has some pretty clear divisions:

- Platform content - instrument and configure your SDK
- Product content - look at all the data ingested into Sentry

And within those primary categories:

- Reference: What you need to know
- Action: What you can do (modify, filter, and so forth)

If you're uncertain, [ask](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-docs/issues).

## Writing for Sentry

Keep these concepts in mind when contributing to docs:

1. Technical accuracy is our primary consideration. Our content helps every developer diagnose, fix, and optimize their code.
2. Use inclusive language, which we discuss more fully [here](https://develop.sentry.dev/inclusion/).
3. Feedback is a gift - share your PR so we can improve our content.
