Our setup script assumes you have [Volta][volta] and [pre-commit][pre-commit] installed.

If you prefer not to use Volta, make sure you're using Node 18.

Run our setup script to get started:

```bash
# Install Homebrew and everything mentioned above
# Clone the sentry-docs repo, and then navigate into the cloned files
./bin/bootstrap
```

Once you have the required system dependencies:

```bash
# Install or update application dependencies
make
```

Now run the development webserver:

```bash
yarn start
```

You will now be able to access docs via http://localhost:3000.

## Linting

A few linters are available. Run `yarn lint` to apply them all.

Some lints can be autofixed with eslint

```bash
yarn lint:eslint:fix
```

Additionally we use prettier to format our code and markdown. Run prettier if you get linting errors in CI:

```bash
yarn lint:prettier:fix
```

## Faster builds

To disable image thumbnail generation, set `DISABLE_THUMBNAILS=1` before running `yarn start` or `yarn build`. Images will not work while in this mode, but builds will be significantly faster.
