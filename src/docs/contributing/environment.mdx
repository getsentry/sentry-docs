You will need [Yarn][yarn], [Volta][volta], and [pre-commit][pre-commit] installed. If you don't have opinions about the process, this will get you going:

```bash
# Install Homebrew and everything mentioned above
bin/bootstrap
```

Once you have the required system dependencies:

```bash
# Install or update application dependencies
make
```

Now run the development webserver:

```bash
yarn start
```

You will now be able to access docs via [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

[yarn]: https://yarnpkg.com/
[volta]: https://volta.sh/
[pre-commit]: https://pre-commit.com/

## Linting

A few linters are available. Run `yarn lint` to apply them all.

Additionally we use prettier to format our code. Run prettier if you get linting errors in CI:

```bash
yarn prettier:fix
```

If you want to run prettier on mdx and markdown files, run

```bash
yarn prettier:fix:all
```

## Faster builds

To disable image thumbnail generation, set `DISABLE_THUMBNAILS=1` before running `yarn start` or `yarn build`. Images will not work while in this mode, but builds will be significantly faster.
