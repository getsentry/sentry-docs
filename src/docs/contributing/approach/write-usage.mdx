The Usage section of the content covers how to manually capture events and message. In most cases, the SDK will adopt the common content, which is stored in `/platforms/common/usage/` - feel free to peruse the files in that directory to help answer questions.

<Alert >

DO NOT change the common content. That change will ripple across all SDKs that rely on the common content. Instead, open an issue on  GitHub with questions/suggestions.

</Alert >

Most of these pages are pretty self-evident, so only basic information is provided. But please ask questions, if any arise, by opening an issue on GitHub.
