title: How to Write - Enriching Events

The Enriching Events section of the content covers how customers can add context to the data sent to Sentry. In most cases, the SDK will adopt the common content, which is stored in `/platforms/common/enriching-events/` - feel free to peruse the files in that directory to answer any questions.

<Alert >

DO NOT change the common content. That change will ripple across all SDKs that rely on the common content. Instead, open an issue on  GitHub with questions/suggestions.

</Alert >

Most of these pages are pretty self-evident, so only basic information is provided. But please ask questions by opening an issue on GitHub.

## Start Here

Determine if the page applies:

- If the content *does not apply*, add the SDK to `notSupported` list in the frontmatter of the file. This will turn off the display of the content for this SDK.
- If the content *does apply*, add the `include` file to the correct directory as noted for each page. If the code sample is not provided, the page will display a big gray box requesting customers open an issue for the missing sample.

### Add Context

This file is `context.mdx`. It explains how to enable custom contexts. Add the code sample to this directory:

- `/src/includes/set-context/`

If the SDK can pass context directly, add it to the list of supported SDKs immediately above "Passing Context Directly".

### Identify Users

This file is `identify-user.mdx`. It explains how to capture the user. Add the code samples to these directories:

- `/src/includes/set-user/`
- `/src/includes/unset-user/`

### Set Transaction Name

This file is `transaction-name.mdx`. It explains how to override the transaction name. Add the code sample to this directory:

- `/src/includes/set-transaction-name/`

If the SDK can control the starting and stopping of transactions, add it to the list of supported SDKs that refers customers to our tracing docs.

### Customize Tags

This file is `tags.mdx`. It explains how to customize tags for an event. Add the code sample to this directory:

- `/src/includes/set-tag/`

If the SDK doesn't bind tags to the current scope, add it to the list of SDKs that don't support this option.

### Attachments

This file is `/attachments/index.mdx`. It explains attaching files along with the event. Add the code sample to this directory:

- `/src/includes/add-attachment/`

If the SDK is part of the native family, add it to the list of SDKs that support the native content regarding:

- Debug information files and built-in support for native crashes
- Large crash reports
- The section on "Crash Reports and Privacy"
- The paragraph regarding limiting crash reports per issue

### Breadcrumbs

This file is `breadcrumbs.mdx`. It explains manual breadcrumbs. Add the code sample to manually add record a breadcrumb to this directory:

- `/src/includes/breadcrumbs-example/`
- `/src/includes/before-breadcrumb/`

One nuance:

- Update, as appropriate, the supported SDK list in the `PlatformSection supported` that precedes "The available breadcrumb keys..."

### User Feedback

This file is `user-feedback.mdx`. It explains how to use the embeddable JS widget. Add the code sample to this directory:

- `/src/includes/user-feedback-example-widget/`

    <Note>

    This is a good example of our adaptable common content model, since this widget doesn't make sense for Java; the Java content uses the same file name, which overrides the common content to display content specific to the user feedback API.

    </Note>

### Scopes

This file is `scopes.mdx`. It explains managing scopes. Add the code samples to these directories:

- `/src/includes/configure-scope/`
- `/src/includes/unset-user/`
- `/src/includes/with-scope/`
