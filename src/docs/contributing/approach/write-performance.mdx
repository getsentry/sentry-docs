The Performance section of the content covers performance instrumentation for our SDKs. In most cases, the SDK will adopt the common content, which is stored in `/platforms/common/performance/` - feel free to peruse the files in that directory to help answer any questions. **However,** each SDK will have its _own_ page devoted to what instrumentation is included. We do not develop common content for this page, just its structure.

<Alert >

DO NOT change the common content. That change will ripple across all SDKs that rely on the common content. Instead, open an issue on GitHub with questions or suggestions.

## Start Here

Determine if the page applies:

- If the content **does not apply**, add the SDK to `notSupported` list in the frontmatter of the file. This will turn off the display of the content for this SDK.
- If the content **does apply**, add the `include` file to the correct directory as noted for each page. If the code sample is not provided, the page will display a big gray box requesting that customers open an issue for the missing sample.

### Set Up

The set up page is where readers may start, though the note at the beginning directs into the instrumentation content, if applicable. The reader path depends on whether the SDK has already been instrumented for performance monitoring in the refreshed Getting Started page. For folks adopting this feature later, this page covers how to set up.

We expect this content to apply to all SDKS.

This file is `index.mdx`. It explains how to install or set up (if appropriate) as well as how to enable tracing.

To develop content for this file:

1. Determine if the SDK needs an installation step or a property set to enable tracing. If so, add the SDK to `Supported` list in the `<PlatformSection>`, then add a code sample to `performance/enable-tracing/`. If not, add the SDK to `notSupported` list, which will prevent the **Enable Tracing** heading from displaying for this SDK.

2. Add a code sample to `/src/includes/performance/configure-sample-rate/` that covers how to set sample rates.

3. Determine if you want to have users verify using our custom instrumentation. If so, add the SDK to `Supported` list in the `<PlatformSection>`. If not, add the SDK to `notSupported` list, which will prevent the `<PlatformLink>` to the Custom Instrumentation page from displaying for this SDK.

4. Determine if the paragraph regarding pageload and navigation applies to the SDK. If so, add the SDK to `Supported` list in the `<PlatformSection>`. If not, add the SDK to `notSupported` list, which will prevent the content from displaying for this SDK.

### Custom Instrumentation

We expect this content to apply to all SDKS.

This file is `custom-instrumentation.mdx`. It explains how to manually instrument transactions.

To develop content for this file, add code samples to these directories:

- `/src/includes/enable-manual-instrumentation/`
- `/src/includes/performance/add-spans-example/`
- `/src/includes/performance/retrieve-transaction/`

Then determine whether to provide a code sample illustrating how to connect errors and spans. If so, add the SDK to `Supported` list in the `<PlatformSection>`, then add a code sample `/src/includes/performance/connect-errors-spans/`.

### Included Instrumentation

This page does not use common content. It covers what instrumentation is provided when tracing is enabled for this SDK.

Populate the `sdk_name/common/performance/` directory with the file `included-instrumentation.mdx`.

### Troubleshooting

This file is `troubleshooting-performance.mdx`. It explains corner cases and how to solve known issues.

1. Determine if the SDK needs an illustration of how to group transactions. If so, add the SDK to `Supported` list in the `<PlatformSection>`, then add a code sample to `performance/group-transaction-example/`. If not, add the SDK to `notSupported` list, which will prevent the **Group Transactions** heading from displaying for this SDK.

2. Add an example to `src/includes/performance/control-data-truncation/`

### Connecting Services

This page does not currently use common content. It covers an example of how to connect frontend and backend services. In future, we may determine that it's useful to expand the content beyond the JS-specific focus.

### Sampling

Guidelines TBD.
