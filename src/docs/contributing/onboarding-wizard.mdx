The docs repository is responsible for a piece of functionality in the Sentry product most commonly referred to as _the Wizard_. More precisely, the product pulls in documentation about SDK configuration in part of its project creation / onboarding process.

The content for the onboarding wizard is located in `src/wizard`, and follows slightly different rules than other pages:

- It is markdown _only_. MDX is not currently supported.
- It is exported as plain HTML (encoded as JSON), thus styles need to exist within Sentry itself.
- The exposed frontmatter is specific to the wizard.

## Directory Structure

The directory structure directly influences how content is exposed within onboarding. It takes the form of:

```bash
src/wizard
src/wizard/{platform}/index.md
src/wizard/{platform}/{guide}.md
```

The `index.md` is exposed as the root platform instructions, and `{guide}.md` is exposed as a child integration of the platform. This functions similarly to the [platform pages](../platforms).

## Page Format

Each page consists of some wizard-specific frontmatter, as well as a markdown body:

```markdown {filename:src/wizard/platform/index.md}
---
name: Platform Name
doc_url: Permalink for this page
type: framework
support_level: production
---

This is my content.
```

<Note>

Wizard content is only supported with native markdown (not MDX), thus only with a `.md` extension.
