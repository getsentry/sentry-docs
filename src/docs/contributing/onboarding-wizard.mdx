The docs repository is responsible for a piece of functionality in the Sentry product most commonly referred to as _the Wizard_. More precisely, the product pulls in documentation about SDK configuration in part of its project creation / onboarding process.

The content for the onboarding wizard is located in `src/wizard`, and follows slightly different rules than other pages:

- It is markdown _only_. MDX is not currently supported.
- It is exported as plain HTML (encoded as JSON), thus styles need to exist within Sentry itself.
- The exposed frontmatter is specific to the wizard.

## Adding Guides

To add a guide of a new platform, follow the next steps:

1. Write the guide, follow the guidelines of the [Directory Structure](#directory-structure) and [Page Format](#page-format).
2. If required, add an icon to [`platformicons`](https://github.com/getsentry/platformicons). If added, you also need to add a [platform to icon mapping](https://github.com/getsentry/platformicons/blob/master/src/platformIcon.tsx), bump the package version and update its version in repositories that use it ([`sentry`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry) and [`docs`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-docs)).
3. Add the platform to Sentry:
    - Add it to the corresponding category in [`platformCategories`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/blob/master/static/app/data/platformCategories.tsx).
    - Add the platform to the tests in [`_platforms`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/blob/master/tests/fixtures/integration-docs/_platforms.json).
    - It may be required to be added to platform-specific places, such as `isEventFromBrowserJavaScriptSDK` in [this `utils` file](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/blob/master/static/app/components/events/interfaces/spans/utils.tsx).

## Directory Structure

The directory structure directly influences how content is exposed within onboarding. It takes the form of:

```bash
src/wizard
src/wizard/{platform}/index.md
src/wizard/{platform}/{guide}.md
```

The `index.md` is exposed as the root platform instructions, and `{guide}.md` is exposed as a child integration of the platform. This functions similarly to the [platform pages](../platforms).

## Page Format

Each page consists of some wizard-specific frontmatter, as well as a markdown body:

```markdown {filename:src/wizard/platform/index.md}
---
name: Platform Name
doc_url: Permalink for this page
type: framework
support_level: production
---

This is my content.
```

<Note>

Wizard content is only supported with native markdown (not MDX), thus only with a `.md` extension.
