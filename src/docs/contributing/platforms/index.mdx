title: Platform Portals
noindex: true

Platform content lives in `src/platforms` and follows some specific rules to generate content. The content is rendered using the same features as all other [pages](../), but has some additional functionality exposed to clone content and encapsulate platforms as portals.

Directory structure has meaning within the platforms directory, and looks something akin to:

```
[platformName]/
  child.mdx
  childTwo/
    index.mdx
  common/
    aSharedPage.mdx
  guides/
    [guideName]/
      uniqueChild.mdx
      childTwo/
        index.mdx
```

Platforms will generate a list of "guides", and inherit all content within common. Given the above example, we end up with a variety of semi-duplicated URLs:

```
/platforms/platformName/
/platforms/platformName/child/
/platforms/platformName/childTwo/
/platforms/platformName/aSharedPage/
/platforms/platformName/guides/guideName/
/platforms/platformName/guides/guideName/child/
/platforms/platformName/guides/guideName/uniqueChild/
/platforms/platformName/guides/guideName/childTwo/
/platforms/platformName/guides/guideName/aSharedPage/
```

This is generated by inheriting all content with the `common/` directory, then adding (or overriding with) content from the siblings (or children as we'd call them). In the above example, you'll see `aSharedPage` is loaded at two different URLs, and `childTwo` is overwritten by `guideName`.

The sidebar on platform pages (handled by `<PlatformSidebar>`) will generate with the Guide, or the Base Platform being the primary section, in addition to a list of other guides available in a section below it. This means that all content is focused on the current guide (usually a framework) they're in, ensuring ease of navigation.

## Globally Shared Content

In addition to platform-shared content (via `common/`) you can also defined globally shared content (shared by all platforms and guides). This is done by placing the content into the top-level `/platforms/common/` path. It works very much the same as the platform-level common content.

## Platform-Specific Components

There are a number of components that aid the development of platform specific pages, as well as behave differently when a platform is active. For more information, see [components](../components/).

## SDK information

SDK information (based on Sentry's release registry) can be automatically embedded on platform pages in the sidebar.

To achieve this, you will need to define the `sdk` value in the frontmatter of the platform (or guide) `index.mdx` file:

```markdown
---
title: Angular
sdk: "sentry.javascript.angular"
---
```
