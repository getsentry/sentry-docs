title: Markdown Variables
noindex: true
---

A transformation is exposed to both Markdown and MDX files which supports processing variables in a Django/Jekyll-style way. The variables available are globally scoped and configured within `gatsby-config.js` (via `gatsby-remark-variables`).

For example:

```markdown
JavaScript SDK: {{ packages.version('sentry.browser.javascript') }}
```

In this case, we expose `packages` as an instance of `PackageRegistry` which is why there is a `packages.version` function available. Additional, we expose a default context variable of `page` which contains the frontmatter of the given markdown node. For example, `{{ page.title }}`.

When a function call is invalid (or errors), or doesn't match something in the known scope, it will simple render it as a literal value instead. So for example:

```markdown
setFingerprint('{{ default }}')
```

Will render as:

```markdown
setFingerprint('{{ default }}')
```

This is because there is no entity scoped to `default` in the template renderer. Additionally - in this case - we also add the `default` expression to the exclusion list in our configuration, as it is commonly use in our documentation.

## `packages`

The `packages` helper is an instance of `PackageRegistry` and exposes several methods.

### `packages.version`

Returns the latest version of the given package.

```javascript
packages.version('sentry.javacript.browser');
```

You may also optionally specify a fallback for if the package isn't found (or there's an upstream error):

```javascript
packages.version('sentry.javacript.browser', '1.0.0');
```

### `packages.checksum`

Returns the checksum of a given file in a package.

```javascript
packages.checksum('sentry.javacript.browser', 'bundle.min.js', 'sha384');
```
