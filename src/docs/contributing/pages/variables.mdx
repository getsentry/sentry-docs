title: Markdown Variables
noindex: true

A transformation is exposed to both Markdown and MDX files which supports processing variables in a Django/Jekyll-style way. The variables available are globally scoped and configured within `gatsby-config.js` (via `gatsby-remark-variables`).

For example:

```markdown {tabTitle:Replacment}
JavaScript SDK: {{@inject packages.version("sentry.javascript.browser") }}
```

```markdown {tabTitle:Source}
JavaScript SDK: {{\@inject packages.version("sentry.javascript.browser") }}
```

In this case, we expose `packages` as an accessor in the package registry which is why there is a `packages.version` function available. Additional, we expose a default context variable of `page` which contains the frontmatter of the given markdown node. For example, `{{\@inject page.title }}`.

When a variable call is invalid (or errors), or doesn't match something in the known scope, it will produce an error. If you need to escape an expression you can add a leading `\` to the `@inject`.

## `packages`

The `packages` helper is an instance of `PackageRegistry` and exposes several methods.

### `packages.version`

Returns the latest version of the given package.

```{tabTitle:Source}
{{\@inject packages.version("sentry.javascript.browser") }}
```

You may also optionally specify a fallback for if the package isn't found (or there's an upstream error):

```{tabTitle:Source}
{{\@inject packages.version("sentry.javascript.browser", "1.0.0") }}
```

### `packages.checksum`

Returns the checksum of a given file in a package.

```{tabTitle:Source}
{{\@inject packages.checksum("sentry.javascript.browser", "bundle.min.js", "sha384") }}
```
