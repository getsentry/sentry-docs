## Markdown vs MDX

:pray: that MDX v2 fixes this.

MDX has its flaws. When rendering components, any text inside of them is treated as raw text (_not_ markdown). To work around this you can use the `<markdown>` tag, but it also has its issues. Generally speaking, put an empty line after the opening tag, and before the closing tag.

```jsx
// don't do this as parsing will hit weird breakages
<markdown>foo bar</markdown>
```

```jsx
// do this
<markdown>foo bar</markdown>
```
