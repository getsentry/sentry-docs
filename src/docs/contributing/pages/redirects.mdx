title: Redirects
noindex: true
---

Redirects are supported via yaml frontmatter in `.md` and `.mdx` files:

```yaml
---
redirect_from:
  - /performance-monitoring/discover/
---

```

These will be generated as both client-side (using an empty page with a meta tag) and server-side (nginx rules).

## Vercel

Because docs.sentry.io is hosted on Vercel, there are also some wider-reaching redirects implemented to cover legacy URLs which cannot be re-implemented using `redirect_from`. See `vercel.json` for these.
