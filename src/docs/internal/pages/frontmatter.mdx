title: Frontmatter
noindex: true
---

Frontmatter a YAML-formatted blob defined at the top of every markdown or mdx file:

```markdown
---
title: Doc Title
---

Markdown or MDX content
```

Standard frontmatter will apply on nearly every page:

`title`

: Document title - used in `<title>` as well as things like search titles.

`noindex` (false)

: Set this to true to disable indexing (robots, algolia) of this content.

`notoc` (false)

: Set this to true to disable table of contents rendering.

`draft` (false)

: Set this to true to mark this page as a draft, and hide it from various other components.

`keywords` ([])

: A list of keywords for indexing with search.

`description`

: A description to use in the `<meta>` header, as well as in auto generated page grids.

`sidebar_order` (10)

: The order of this page in auto generated sidebars and grids.

Much of the other functionality for pages is also driven via frontmatter, such as:

- [Redirects](../redirects/)
- [Search](../search/)
