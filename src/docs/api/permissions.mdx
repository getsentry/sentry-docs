If you're building on top of Sentry's API (i.e using [Auth Tokens](/api/auth/)), you'll need certain scopes to access
different API endpoints.

If you're looking for information on membership roles please visit the
[membership](/accounts/membership/) documentation.

### Organizations

|               |             |
| :-:           | :-:         |
| **GET**       | `org:read`  |
| **PUT/POST**  | `org:write` |
| **DELETE**    | `org:admin` |

### Projects

|              |                 |

| **GET**      | `project:read`  |
| **PUT/POST** | `project:write` |
| **DELETE**   | `project:admin` |


<Alert level="warning" title="Note"><markdown>


The `project:releases` scope will give you access to both **project**
and **organization** release endpoints. The available endpoints are listed in the
[Releases](/api/releases/) section of the API Documentation.

**PUT/DELETE** methods only apply to updating/deleting issues.
Events in sentry are immutable and can only be deleted by deleting the whole issue.

| **GET/PUT/POST/DELETE**  | `project:releases` |


<Alert level="warning" title="Note"><markdown>


Be aware that if you're using `sentry-cli` to [manage your releases](/cli/releases/), you'll need a token which also has `org:read` scope.
