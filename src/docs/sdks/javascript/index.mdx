On this page, we provide concise information to get you up and running with Sentry's JavaScript SDK, automatically reporting errors and exceptions in your application.

**Note:** If you don't already have an account and Sentry project established, head over to [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io/signup/), then return to this page.

In the right place? We also offer documentation for:

- [Node.js](/platforms/node)
- [React](/platforms/javascript/react)
- [Angular](/platforms/javascript/angular)

## Install

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your application’s runtime. Add the Sentry SDK as a dependency using `yarn` or `npm`:

```bash
# Using yarn
$ yarn add @sentry/browser

# Using npm
$ npm install @sentry/browser
```

The quickest way to get started is to use the CDN hosted version of the JavaScript browser SDK:

<JsCdnTag />

**Note:** If you have Content Security Policy (CSP) set up on your site, you will need to add the `script-src` of wherever you're loading the SDK from, and the origin of your DSN. For example:

* `script-src: https://browser.sentry-cdn.com`
* `connect-src: *.sentry.io`

## Configure

`init` Sentry as soon as possible:

```JavaScript
Sentry.init({ dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___' });
```

Once this is done, all unhandled exceptions are automatically captured by Sentry.

**Important:** Note your DSN. The *DSN* (Data Source Name) tells the SDK where to send events. If you forget it, view *Settings -> Projects -> Client Keys (DSN)* in the Sentry web UI.

## Verify Setup

Verify your setup by intentionally sending an error that breaks your application. For example, in JavaScript, calling an undefined function throws an exception:

```JavaScript
myUndefinedFunction();
```

Resolve the created error by logging in to Sentry, then opening your project. On the **Issue Details** page, scroll down to the Exception stack trace and view the error.

## Capture Errors

A few key terms to know as we proceed:
- An *event* is one instance of sending data to Sentry. Generally, this data is an error or exception.
- An *issue* is a grouping of similar events.
- The reporting of an event is called *capturing*.
When an event is captured, it’s sent to Sentry.

By including and configuring Sentry, our JavaScript SDK automatically attaches global handlers to *capture* uncaught exceptions and unhandled promise rejections, as described in the official ECMAScript 6 standard.  You can disable this default behavior by changing the `onunhandledrejection` option to `false` in your GlobalHandlers integration and manually hook into each event handler, then call `Sentry.captureException` or `Sentry.captureMessage` directly.

You may also need to manage your configuration if you are using a third-party library to implement promises. Also, keep in mind that browsers may take security measures when serving script files from different origins that can block error reporting.

Learn more about how to manually capture errors or enable message capture with Sentry's JavaScript SDK in [Capture Errors](/sdks/javascript/config/capture).

### Automatically Enrich Error Data

Events sent by the JavaScript SDK to Sentry are enriched with data that helps identify the source of the event. Much of this data is sent automatically - including the error context and environment - as well as the trail of events that led up to the event, which we call breadcrumbs. You don't need to configure these, though you may modify them.

Learn more about the data sent to with events in [Enrich Event Data](/sdks/javascript/errors/intro/).

### Set the Release Version

When you configure Sentry to include the version of your application, Sentry can tell you about regressions as well as detailed information about the suspect commit.

Use the `process.env.npm_package_version`:

```JavaScript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
  release: 'my-project-name@' + process.env.npm_package_version,
});
```

After you inform Sentry of a new release, you will see information about it, such as new issues and regressions introduced in the release.

Learn more about what releases can do, including using a repository integration, creating the release and associated commits, and telling Sentry when you deploy a release in [our documentation for Releases](/workflow/releases/).

### Upload Source Maps

Sentry supports un-minifying JavaScript via source maps. This lets you view source code context obtained from stack traces in their original untransformed form, which is particularly useful for debugging minified code (for example, UglifyJS), or transpiled code from a higher-level language (for example, TypeScript, ES6).

We **highly recommend** you incorporate source maps to receive the full benefit of error tracking and monitoring.

When you’re using the Sentry JavaScript SDK, the SDK automatically fetches the source code and source maps by scraping the URLs within the stack trace. If you need to disable the JavaScript source fetching, log in to Sentry and toggle off `Allow JavaScript source fetching` in your organization's settings for Security & Privacy. See our [source maps documentation](/platforms/javascript/sourcemaps) to learn more.

Upload source maps using either our [Webpack plugin](/platforms/javascript/sourcemaps/#webpack) or the [Sentry CLI](cli/). Sourcemaps can be generated by [Uglify JS](/platforms/javascript/sourcemaps/#uglifyjs), [System JS](/platforms/javascript/sourcemaps/#systemjs), or [TypeScript](/platforms/javascript/sourcemaps/#typescript).

## Monitor Performance

Performance Monitoring helps you see everything from macro-level metrics to micro-level spans, and you’ll be able to cross-reference transactions with related issues, customize queries based on your personal needs, and substantially more.

To get started with performance monitoring using Sentry’s JavaScript SDK, first install the `@sentry/browser` and `@sentry/apm` packages:

```bash
# Using yarn
$ yarn add @sentry/browser @sentry/apm

# Using npm
$ npm install @sentry/browser @sentry/apm
```

Alternatively, instead of `npm` packages, you can use our pre-built CDN bundle that combines both `@sentry/browser` and `@sentry/apm`:

<JsCdnTag apm={true}/>

Next, initialize the integration in your call to `Sentry.init`:

```javascript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/browser';
import { Integrations as ApmIntegrations } from '@sentry/apm';
Sentry.init({
  dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
  release: 'my-project-name@' + process.env.npm_package_version,
  integrations: [
    new ApmIntegrations.Tracing(),
  ],
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0, // Be sure to lower this in production
});
```

Performance data is transmitted using a new event type called “transactions”, which you can learn about in [Distributed Tracing](/performance-monitoring/distributed-tracing). To capture transactions, you must install the performance package and configure your SDK to set the `tracesSampleRate` configuration to a nonzero value. The example configuration above will transmit 100% of captured transactions; lower this value in production to avoid consuming your quota too quickly.
