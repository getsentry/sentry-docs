title: Breadcrumbs
excerpt: ""

Sentry uses _breadcrumbs_ to create a trail of events that happened prior to an issue. These events are often similar to traditional logs, but can record more rich, structured data.

## What Sentry Sends Automatically

SDKs will automatically start recording breadcrumbs by enabling integrations, such as `Sentry.Integrations.Breadcrumbs`. Learn more in our documentation for [Default Integrations](sdks/javascript/integrations/default/). In addition, the JavaScript SDK will automatically record all location changes and automatically records certain events, such as changes to the URL and XHR requests to add context to an error.

Each crumb in the trail includes:

Message

: A string describing the event. It is rendered as text with all whitespace preserved. Often used as a drop-in for a traditional log message.

Data

: A key-value mapping of metadata around the event. This is often used instead of message, but may be used in addition. The Sentry UI will display all the data sent.

Category

: A category under which to label the event. This crumb is similar to a logger name, and will let you more easily understand the area an event took place, such as `auth`.

Level

: The severity of an event. The level is set to one of five values, which are, in order of severity: `fatal`, `error`, `warning`, `info`, and `debug.error`.  The default is `info`.

Type

: A semi-internal attribute `type` can control the type of the breadcrumb. By default all breadcrumbs are recorded as `default`, which makes them appear as a log entry. Other types are available that influence how they are rendered:

  * `default`: The default breadcrumb rendering.
  * `http`: Renders the breadcrumb as HTTP request.
  * `error`: Renders the breadcrumb as a hard error.

  _The type is not exclusively used to customize the rendering. We do not recommend changing the type from the default._

Timestamp

: A timestamp representing when the breadcrumb occurred. The format is either a string as defined in RFC 3339 or a numeric (integer or float) value representing the number of seconds that have elapsed since the Unix epoch.

### Modify Breadcrumbs

Developers who want to modify the breadcrumbs interface can read about this in detail using the developer documentation devoted to the [Breadcrumbs Interface](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/event-payloads/breadcrumbs/). Manual breadcrumb recording and customization of breadcrumbs are documented on this page.

### Manual Breadcrumbs

You can manually add breadcrumbs whenever something interesting happens. For example, you might manually record a breadcrumb if the user authenticates or another state change happens.

This example is for an application that sometimes throws an error after the screen resizes.

```JavaScript
// `debounce` function comes from a 3rd party library like Lodash or can be implemented manually
window.addEventListener('resize', debounce(function (event) {
  Sentry.addBreadcrumb({
    category: 'ui',
    message: 'New window size:' + window.innerWidth + 'x' + window.innerHeight,
    level: 'info'
  });
}));
```

### Customize Breadcrumbs

SDKs customize breadcrumbs through the `before_breadcrumb` hook. This hook passes an already assembled breadcrumb assembled breadcrumb and, in some SDKs, an optional hint. The function can modify the breadcrumb or decide to discard it entirely.
