Integrations extend the functionality of our JavaScript SDK to cover common libraries and environments automatically.

- **[Default Integrations](/sdks/javascript/integrations/default)**

    Learn more about system integrations `InboundFilters`, `FunctionToString`, `Breadcrumbs`, `GlobalHandlers`, `LinkedErrors`, `UserAgent` that are enabled by default to integrate into the standard library or the interpreter itself.

- **[Pluggable Integrations](/sdks/javascript/integrations/plugin)**

    Learn more about pluggable integrations `ExtraErrorData`, `CaptureConsole`, `Dedupe`, `Debug`, `RewriteFrames`, `ReportingObserver`, which are snippets of code that augment functionality for specific applications and/or frameworks.

- **[Adding a Custom Integration](/sdks/javascript/integrations/custom)**

    Learn how you can enable a custom integration.

## Framework Integrations

These integrations build upon the functions available in the JavaScript SDK. The functions are specific to the framework, and must be installed separately.
