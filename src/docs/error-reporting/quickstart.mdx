For an overview of what Sentry does, take a look at the Sentry [workflow](https://blog.sentry.io/2018/03/06/the-sentry-workflow).

Sentry is designed to be both simple to get off the ground and powerful to grow into. If you have never used Sentry before, this tutorial helps you get started.

Getting started with Sentry is a three step process:

1.  [Sign up for an account](https://sentry.io/signup/)
2.  [Install your SDK](#pick-a-client-integration)
2.  [Configure your SDK](#configure-the-sdk)

## Install an SDK {#pick-a-client-integration}

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your application’s runtime. These are platform specific and allow Sentry to have a deep understanding of how your application works.

## Configure the SDK {#configure-the-sdk}

After you completed setting up a project in Sentry, you’ll be given a value which we call a _DSN_, or _Data Source Name_. It looks a lot like a standard URL, but it’s actually just a representation of the configuration required by the Sentry SDKs. It consists of a few pieces, including the protocol, public key, the server address, and the project identifier.

## Capturing your first event

Once you have Sentry integrated into your project, you probably want to verify that everything is working as expected before deploying it.

## Next Steps

Now that you’ve got basic reporting set up, you’ll want to explore adding additional context to your data.
