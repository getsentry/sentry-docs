title: "Server-side Fingerprinting"

Server-side fingerprinting is also configured with a config similar to
[grouping enhancements](/data-management/event-grouping/grouping-enhancements/),
but the syntax is slightly different. The matchers are the same
but instead of flipping flags, a fingerprint is assigned that overrides the
default grouping entirely.

These rules can be configured on a per-project basis under _Project Settings > General Settings > Grouping Settings_.

```
(matcher:expression)+ -> list, of, values
```

All values are matched against, and in the case of stack traces, all frames are considered.
If all matches in a line match, then the fingerprint is applied. The syntax follows
the syntax from Discover queries. If you want to negate the match, you can prefix
the expression with an exclamation mark (`!`).

The matchers are:

`type`

: matches on an exception type

`value`

: matches on an exception value

`message`

: matches on a log message. This will also automatically check for the additional exception value.

`logger`

: matches on the name of the logger.

`level`

: matches on the log level.

`tags.tag_name`

: matches on the value of the tag `tag_name`.

The matchers also include the following from Custom Grouping Enhancements. See [grouping enhancements](/data-management/event-grouping/grouping-enhancements/#rules) for more info on how they work:

- `family`
- `path`
- `module`
- `function`
- `package`
- `app`

Don't forget that you can also use the variables `{{ function }}`, `{{ default }}`, `{{ transaction }}`, `{{ type }}`, `{{ function }}`, `{{ module }}`, `{{ package }}`, `{{ logger }}`, `{{ level }}`, and
`{{ tags.tag_name }}` to customize fingerprinting as you can if the client
submits them. See also [SDK Fingerprinting](../sdk-fingerprinting/).

## Examples

```ini {tabTitle:Fingerprinting Config}
# force all errors of the same type to have the same fingerprint
type:DatabaseUnavailable -> system-down
type:RedisConnectionError -> system-down

# force all events with a certain message to be matched together
message:"unexpected i/o error: *" -> io-error

# group all TimeoutError exceptions by the transaction that caused them
type:TimeoutError -> {{ transaction }}

# group all JavaScript errors in a module by the topmost module and
# function name
path:**/some-module/** -> {{ module }}, {{ function }}

# force all memory allocation errors to be grouped together
family:native function:malloc -> memory-allocation-error

# group all allocation errors by the package (dylib, executable)
# that caused them
function:*alloc* -> {{ package }}

# group all messages of some loggers by logger name and log level.
logger:myproject.noisy.* -> noisy, {{ logger }}, {{ level }}
```
