On this page, we get you up and running with Sentry's Capacitor SDK, so that it will automatically report errors and exceptions in your application.

The Capacitor SDK can be used with any framework that supports Capacitor.

## Install

The Capacitor SDK is currently available for Android devices.
To install the Capacitor SDK, use npm or yarn:

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install --save @sentry/capacitor @sentry/tracing
```

```bash {tabTitle:Yarn}
yarn add @sentry/capacitor @sentry/tracing
```

Add the plugin declaration to your `MainActivity.java` file

```groovy {filename:MainActivity.java}
import io.sentry.capacitor.SentryCapacitor;

public class MainActivity extends BridgeActivity {
  @Override
  public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

    // Initializes the Bridge
    this.init(savedInstanceState, new ArrayList<Class<? extends Plugin>>() {{
      add(SentryCapacitor.class);
    }});
  }
}
```

## Configure

You should `init` the SDK as soon as possible during your app's creation phase.

```javascript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/capacitor';
import { Integrations } from '@sentry/tracing';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // To set your release version
  release: "my-project-name@" + process.env.npm_package_version,
  integrations: [new Integrations.BrowserTracing()],

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for performance monitoring.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

## Verify

One way to verify your setup is by capturing a test exception on app load:


```javascript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/capacitor';

Sentry.captureException("my test exception");
```
