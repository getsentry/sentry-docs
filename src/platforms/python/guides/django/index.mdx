Sentry's [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) integration adds support for the Django Framework. It enables automatic reporting of errors and exceptions as well as performance monitoring. In order to get started using the integration, you should have a [Sentry account](https://sentry.io) and a project set up.

<Note>

If you're using Python 3.7., Django applications with Channels 2.0 will be correctly instrumented. Older versions of Python will require the installation of [aiocontextvars](https://pypi.org/project/aiocontextvars/).

</Note>

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI with the `django` extra:

```bash
pip install --upgrade 'sentry-sdk[django]'
```

## Configure

To configure the Sentry SDK, initialize in your `settings.py` file.

```python {filename:settings.py}
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",

    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for performance monitoring.
    # We recommend adjusting this value in production,
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
)
```

## Verify

This snippet includes an intentional error, so you can test that everything is working as soon as you set it up:

```python
from django.urls import path

def trigger_error(request):
    division_by_zero = 1 / 0

urlpatterns = [
    path('sentry-debug/', trigger_error),
    # ...
]
```

Visiting this route will trigger an error that will be captured by Sentry.

## Behavior

### Issue Reporting

- If you use `django.contrib.auth` and you have set `send_default_pii=True` in your call to `init`, user data (current user id, email address, username) is attached to error eventa.
- Request data is attached to all events: **HTTP method, URL, headers, form data, JSON payloads**. Sentry excludes raw bodies and multipart file uploads.
- Logs emitted by any logger are recorded as breadcrumbs by the [Logging](/platforms/python/guides/logging/) integration (this integration is enabled by default).

### Performance Monitoring

The following parts of your FastAPI project are monitored:

- Middleware stack
- Signals
- Database queries
- Redis commands

<Note>

The parameter `traces_sample_rate` needs to be set when initializing the Sentry SDK for performance measurements to be recorded.

</Note>
