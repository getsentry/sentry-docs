The Django integration adds support for the [Django Web Framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
from Version 1.6 upwards.

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk`:

```bash
$ pip install --upgrade sentry-sdk
```

## Configure

To configure the SDK, initialize it with the Django integration in your `settings.py` file:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.django import DjangoIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    integrations=[DjangoIntegration()],

    # If you wish to associate users to errors (assuming you are using
    # django.contrib.auth) you may enable sending PII data.
    send_default_pii=True
)
```

## Verify

Verify your Sentry installation by creating a route that triggers an error:

```py
from django.urls import path

def trigger_error(request):
    division_by_zero = 1 / 0

urlpatterns = [
    path('sentry-debug/', trigger_error),
    # ...
]
```

Visiting this route will trigger an error that will be captured by Sentry.

## A note on Django Channels

A Django application using [Channels 2.0](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) will be correctly instrumented under Python 3.7. For older versions of Python you'll have to install `aiocontextvars` from PyPI or your application will not start.

If you experience memory leaks in your channels consumers while using the SDK, you need to wrap your entire application in Sentry's [ASGI middleware](/platforms/python/guides/asgi/).

Unfortunately the SDK is not able to do so by itself, as [Channels is missing some hooks for instrumentation](https://github.com/django/channels/issues/1348).

## Behavior

- All exceptions leading to an Internal Server Error are reported.

- Request data is attached to all events: **HTTP method, URL, headers, form data, JSON payloads**. Sentry excludes raw bodies and multipart file uploads. Sentry also excludes personally identifiable information (such as user ids, usernames, cookies, authorization headers, IP addresses) unless you set `send_default_pii` to `True`.

- Each request has a separate scope. Changes to the scope within a view, for example setting a tag, will only apply to events sent as part of the request being handled.

- If you use `django.contrib.auth` and have set `send_default_pii=True` in your call to `init`, user data (current user id, email address, username) is attached to the event.

- The Sentry Python SDK will attach SQL queries as breadcrumbs.

- Logging with any logger will create breadcrumbs when the [Logging](/platforms/python/guides/logging/)
  integration is enabled (done by default).

## Options

You can pass the following keyword arguments to `DjangoIntegration()`:

- `transaction_style`:

  ```python
  def my_function(request):
      return "ok"

  urlpatterns = [
      url(r"^myurl/(?P<myid>\d+)/$", my_function)
  ]
  ```

  In the above code, you would set the transaction to:

  - `/myurl/{myid}` if you set `transaction_style="url"`. This matches the behavior of the old Raven SDK.
  - `my_function` if you set `transaction_style="function_name"`

  The default is `"url"`.

## User Feedback

You can use the user feedback feature with this integration. For more information see [User Feedback](enriching-events/user-feedback/).

## Reporting other status codes

In some situations, it might make sense to report `404 Not Found` and other errors besides uncaught exceptions (`500 Internal Server Error`) to Sentry. You can achieve this by writing your own Django view for those status codes. For example:

```python

# urls.py

handler404 = 'mysite.views.my_custom_page_not_found_view'

# views.py

from django.http import HttpResponseNotFound
from sentry_sdk import capture_message


def my_custom_page_not_found_view(*args, **kwargs):
    capture_message("Page not found!", level="error")

    # return any response here, e.g.:
    return HttpResponseNotFound("Not found")
```

The error message you send to Sentry will have the usual request data attached.
