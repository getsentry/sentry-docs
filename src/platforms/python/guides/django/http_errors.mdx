If you want to report `404 Not Found` and other errors besides uncaught exceptions (`500 Internal Server Error`) to Sentry, you can write your own Django view for those status codes. For example:

```python

# urls.py

handler404 = 'mysite.views.my_custom_page_not_found_view'

# views.py

from django.http import HttpResponseNotFound
from sentry_sdk import capture_message


def my_custom_page_not_found_view(*args, **kwargs):
    capture_message("Page not found!", level="error")

    # return any response here, e.g.:
    return HttpResponseNotFound("Not found")
```

The error message you send to Sentry will have the usual request data attached.

Refer to [Customizing Error Views](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/http/views/#customizing-error-views) from the Django documentation for more information. You can also view our [troubleshooting information](../troubleshooting/).
