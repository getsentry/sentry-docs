_(New in version 0.7.11)_

The Falcon integration adds support for the [Falcon Web Framework](https://falconframework.org/).
The integration has been confirmed to work with Falcon 1.4 and 2.0.

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI with the `falcon` extra:

```bash
pip install --upgrade 'sentry-sdk[falcon]==0.16.2'
```

## Configure

To configure the SDK, initialize it with the integration before your app has been initialized:

```python
import falcon
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.falcon import FalconIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    integrations=[FalconIntegration()]
)

api = falcon.API()
```

## Behavior

- The Sentry Python SDK will install the Falcon integration for all of your apps. The integration hooks into the base `falcon.API` class via monkey patching.

- All exceptions leading to an Internal Server Error are reported.

- Request data is attached to all events: **HTTP method, URL, headers, form data, JSON payloads**. Sentry excludes raw bodies and multipart file uploads. Sentry also excludes personally identifiable information (such as user ids, usernames, cookies, authorization headers, IP addresses) unless you set `send_default_pii` to `True`.

- Each request has a separate scope. Changes to the scope within a view, for example setting a tag, will only apply to events sent as part of the request being handled.

## Options

You can pass the following keyword arguments to `FalconIntegration()`:

- `transaction_style`:

  ```python
  class MessageResource:
      def on_get(self, req, resp, message_id):
          msg = database.get_message(message_id)
          resp.media = msg.as_json()

  app = falcon.API()
  app.add_route("/message/{message_id}", MessageResource())
  ```

  In the above code, you would set the transaction to:

  - `/myurl/b48a7686-ad8c-4c94-8c3b-412ec7f25db2123` if you set `transaction_style="path"`.
  - `/myurl/{message_id}` if you set `transaction_style="uri_template"`

  The default is `"uri_template"`.
