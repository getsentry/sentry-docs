The Sanic integration adds support for the [Sanic Web Framework](https://sanicframework.org). We support the following versions, which are known to work with the SDK:

- `0.8`
- `18.12 LTS`
- `19.12 LTS`
- `21.3`, `21.6`, `21.9`, `21.12 LTS`
- `22.6

_\* Starting with Sanic v21, `sentry-sdk` v1.3.0 or higher is required_

The SDK will support any Sanic version of the form `x.12` (LTS versions). If the latest version of Sanic is not explicitly listed here, it _might_ not be supported.

A Python version of 3.6 or greater is also required.

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI:

```bash
pip install --upgrade sentry-sdk
```

If you're on Python 3.6, you also need the `aiocontextvars` package:

```bash
pip install --upgrade aiocontextvars
```

## Configure

To configure the SDK, initialize it with the integration before or after your app has been initialized:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.sanic import SanicIntegration
from sanic import Sanic

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    integrations=[
        SanicIntegration(),
    ],

    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for performance monitoring.
    # We recommend adjusting this value in production,
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
)

app = Sanic(__name__)
```

## Behavior

- The Sentry Python SDK will install the Sanic integration for all of your apps.

- All exceptions leading to an Internal Server Error are reported.

- Request data is attached to all events: **HTTP method, URL, headers, form data, JSON payloads**. Sentry excludes raw bodies and multipart file uploads. Sentry also excludes personally identifiable information (such as user ids, usernames, cookies, authorization headers, IP addresses) unless you set `send_default_pii` to `True`.

- Each request has a separate scope. Changes to the scope within a view, for example setting a tag, will only apply to events sent as part of the request being handled.

- Logging with any logger will create breadcrumbs when
  the [Logging](/platforms/python/guides/logging/)
  integration is enabled (done by default).
