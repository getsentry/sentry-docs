The Sanic integration adds support for the [Sanic Web Framework](https://sanicframework.org).

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI with the `sanic` extra:

```bash
pip install --upgrade sentry-sdk[sanic]
```

If you're on Python 3.6, you also need the `aiocontextvars` package:

```bash
pip install --upgrade aiocontextvars
```

## Configure

If you have the `sanic` package in your dependencies, the Bottle integration will be enabled automatically. There is nothing to do for you except initializing the Sentry SDK.

<SignInNote />

```python
from sanic import Sanic
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for performance monitoring.
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
)

app = Sanic(__name__)
```

## Verify

```python
from sanic import Sanic
from sanic.response import text

sentry_sdk.init(...)  # same as above

app = Sanic(__name__)

@app.get("/")
async def hello_world(request):
    1 / 0  # raises an error
    return text("Hello, world.")`
```

When you point your browser to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) a error event will be sent to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

## Behavior

- The Sentry Python SDK will install the Sanic integration for all of your apps.

- All exceptions leading to an Internal Server Error are reported.

- Request data is attached to all events: **HTTP method, URL, headers, form data, JSON payloads**. Sentry excludes raw bodies and multipart file uploads. Sentry also excludes personally identifiable information (such as user ids, usernames, cookies, authorization headers, IP addresses) unless you set `send_default_pii` to `True`.

- Each request has a separate scope. Changes to the scope within a view, for example setting a tag, will only apply to events sent as part of the request being handled.

- Logging with any logger will create breadcrumbs when
  the [Logging](/platforms/python/guides/logging/)
  integration is enabled (done by default).

## Supported Versions

- Sanic: 0.8+
- Python: 3.6+ (Sanic 0.8+), 3.7+ (Sanic 21.0+)
