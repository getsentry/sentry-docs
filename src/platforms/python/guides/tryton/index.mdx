_(New in version 0.14.0)_

The Tryton integration adds support for the [Tryton Framework Server](https://www.tryton.org/).

To configure the SDK, initialize it with the integration in a custom wsgi.py script:

```python
# wsgi.py
import sentry_sdk
import sentry_sdk.integrations.trytond

sentry_sdk.init(
    desn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    integrations=[sentry_sdk.integrations.trytond.TrytondWSGIIntegration()]
)

from trytond.application import app as application

# ...
```

In Tryton>=5.4 an error handler can be registered to respond the client
with a custom error message including the Sentry event id instead of a traceback.

```python
# wsgi.py
# ...

from trytond.exceptions import TrytonException
from trytond.exceptions import UserError

@application.error_handler
def _(app, request, e):
    if isinstance(e, TrytonException):
        return
    else:
        event_id = sentry_sdk.last_event_id()
        data = UserError('Custom message', f'{event_id}\n{e}')
        return app.make_response(request, data)

```

## Behavior

- The Sentry Python SDK will install the Tryton integration. The integration hooks to the TrytonWSGI class' instance.

- All uncaught exceptions not inherited from Tryton exceptions are reported.

- Request data is attached to all events: **HTTP method, URL, headers, form data, JSON payloads**. Sentry excludes raw bodies and multipart file uploads. Sentry also excludes personally identifiable information (such as user ids, usernames, cookies, authorization headers, IP addresses) unless you set `send_default_pii` to `True`.

Each request has a separate scope. Changes to the scope within a view, for example setting a tag, will only apply to events sent as part of the request being handled.
