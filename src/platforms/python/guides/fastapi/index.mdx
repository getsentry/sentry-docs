The FastAPI integration adds support for the [FastAPI Framework](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).

The Sentry SDK automatically enables support for FastAPI if you have the `fastapi` Python package installed in your project. There are no configuration options you need to add when initializing the Sentry SDK as everything works out of the box.

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI with the `fastapi` extra:

```bash
pip install --upgrade 'sentry-sdk[fastapi]'
```

## Configure

To configure the SDK, initialize it with the integration before your app has been initialized:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

import sentry_sdk


sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",

    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for performance monitoring.
    # We recommend adjusting this value in production,
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
)

app = FastAPI()
```

## Verify

This snippet includes an intentional error, so you can test that everything is working as soon as you set it up:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI


app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/sentry-debug")
async def trigger_error():
    division_by_zero = 1 / 0

```

Visiting `"/sentry-debug"` will trigger an error that will be captured by Sentry.

## Behavior

- All exceptions leading to an Internal Server Error are reported.

- Request data is attached to all events: **HTTP method, URL, headers, form data, JSON payloads**. Sentry excludes raw bodies and multipart file uploads. Sentry also excludes personally identifiable information (such as user ids, usernames, cookies, authorization headers, IP addresses) unless you set `send_default_pii` to `True`.

- If a `traces_sample_rate` is set, then performance information is also reported, which you can see on the **Performance** page of [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

## Options

If you want to change the default behavior of the FastAPI integration, you need to instantiate the integration by hand and pass it to Sentry's `init` function.

Because FastAPI is based on the Starlette framework, both integrations `StarletteIntegration` and `FastApiIntegration`, must be instantiated.

You can pass the keyword argument `transaction_style` to `StarletteIntegration()` and `FastApiIntegration()`.

With this option, you can influence how the transactions are named in Sentry. For example:

```python
sentry_sdk.init(
    # ...
    integrations=[
        StarletteIntegration(transaction_style="endpoint"),
        FastApiIntegration(transaction_style="endpoint"),
    ],
)

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/catalog/product/{product_id}")
async def product_detail(product_id):
    return {...}
```

In the above code, the transaction name will be:

- `"/catalog/product/{product_id}"` if you set `transaction_style="url"`
- `"product_detail"` if you set `transaction_style="endpoint"`

The default is `"url"`.
