_(New in version : 0.6.3)_

The Tornado integration adds support for the [Tornado Web Framework](https://www.tornadoweb.org/). A Tornado version of 5 or greater and Python 3.6 or greater is required.

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI:

```bash
pip install --upgrade sentry-sdk
```

If you're on Python 3.6, you also need the `aiocontextvars` package:

```bash
pip install --upgrade aiocontextvars
```

## Configure

Initialize the SDK before starting the server:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.tornado import TornadoIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    integrations=[TornadoIntegration()]
)

# Your app code here, without changes

class MyHandler(...):
    # ...
```

## Behavior

- The Tornado integration will be installed for all of your apps and handlers.

- All exceptions leading to a Internal Server Error are reported.

- Request data is attached to all events: **HTTP method, URL, headers, form data, JSON payloads**. Sentry excludes raw bodies and multipart file uploads. Sentry also excludes personally identifiable information (such as user ids, usernames, cookies, authorization headers, IP addresses) unless you set `send_default_pii` to `True`.

- Each request has a separate scope. Changes to the scope within a view, for example setting a tag, will only apply to events sent as part of the request being handled.

- Logging with any logger will create breadcrumbs when
  the [Logging](/platforms/python/guides/logging/)
  integration is enabled (done by default).
