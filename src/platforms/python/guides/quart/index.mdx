_(New in version ???)_

The Quart integration adds support for the [Quart Web Framework](https://gitlab.com/pgjones/quart). We support Quart >= 0.16.1.

_* Requires `sentry-sdk` ??? or higher_

A Python version of 3.7 or greater is also required.

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI:

```bash
pip install --upgrade sentry-sdk
```

## Configure

To configure the SDK, initialize it with the integration before or after your app has been initialized:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.quart import QuartIntegration
from quart import Quart

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    integrations=[QuartIntegration()]
)

app = Quart(__name__)
```

## Behavior

- The Sentry Python SDK will install the Quart integration for all of your apps.

- All exceptions leading to an Internal Server Error, from before/after serving functions, and background tasks are reported.

- Request data is attached to all events: **HTTP method, URL, headers**. Sentry also excludes personally identifiable information (such as user ids, usernames, cookies, authorization headers, IP addresses) unless you set `send_default_pii` to `True`.

- Each request has a separate scope. Changes to the scope within a view, for example setting a tag, will only apply to events sent as part of the request being handled.

- Logging with any logger will create breadcrumbs when
  the [Logging](/platforms/python/guides/logging/)
  integration is enabled (done by default).
