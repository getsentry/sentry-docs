The ASGI middleware can be used to instrument any [ASGI](https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)-compatible web framework to attach request data for your events.

<Note>

If you use an ASGI framework please use our specific integrations for [FastAPI](/platforms/python/guides/fastapi/), [Starlette](/platforms/python/guides/starlette/), [Sanic](/platforms/python/guides/sanic/), [Quart](/platforms/python/guides/quart/), [Falcon](/platforms/python/guides/falcon/) instead of this ASGI middleware.

</Note>

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.asgi import SentryAsgiMiddleware

from myapp import asgi_app

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",

    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for performance monitoring.
    # We recommend adjusting this value in production,
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
)

asgi_app = SentryAsgiMiddleware(asgi_app)
```

The middleware supports both ASGI 2 and ASGI 3 transparently.

## Behavior

- Request data is attached to all events: **HTTP method, URL, headers**. Sentry excludes raw bodies and multipart file uploads. Sentry also excludes personally identifiable information (such as user ids, usernames, cookies, authorization headers, IP addresses) unless you set `send_default_pii` to `True`.

- Each request has a separate scope. Changes to the scope within a view, for example setting a tag, will only apply to events sent as part of the request being handled.

- The ASGI middleware does not behave like a regular integration. It is not initialized through an extra parameter to `init` and is not attached to a client. When capturing or supplementing events, it just uses the currently active hub.
