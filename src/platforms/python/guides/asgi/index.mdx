_(New in version 0.10.2)_

The ASGI middleware can be used to instrument any [ASGI](https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)-compatible web framework to attach request data for your events.

This can be used to instrument, for example [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/middleware/) or [Django Channels 2.0](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.asgi import SentryAsgiMiddleware

from myapp import asgi_app

sentry_sdk.init(dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___")

asgi_app = SentryAsgiMiddleware(asgi_app)
```

The middleware supports both ASGI 2 and ASGI 3 transparently.

## Behavior

- Request data is attached to all events: **HTTP method, URL, headers, form data, JSON payloads**. Sentry excludes raw bodies and multipart file uploads. Sentry also excludes personally identifiable information (such as user ids, usernames, cookies, authorization headers, IP addresses) unless you set `send_default_pii` to `True`.

- Each request has a separate scope. Changes to the scope within a view, for example setting a tag, will only apply to events sent as part of the request being handled.

- The ASGI middleware does not behave like a regular integration. It is not initialized through an extra parameter to `init` and is not attached to a client. When capturing or supplementing events, it just uses the currently active hub.
