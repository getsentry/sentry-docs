The Celery integration adds support for the [Celery Task Queue System](https://docs.celeryq.dev/).

Just add `CeleryIntegration()` to your `integrations` list:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.celery import CeleryIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn='___PUBLIC_DSN___',
    integrations=[
        CeleryIntegration(),
    ],

    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for performance monitoring.
    # We recommend adjusting this value in production,
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
)
```

Additionally, the Sentry Python SDK will set the transaction on the event to the task name, and it will improve the grouping for global Celery errors such as timeouts.

The integration will automatically report errors from all celery jobs.

Generally, make sure that the **call to `init` is loaded on worker startup**, and not only in the module where your tasks are defined. Otherwise, the initialization happens too late and events might end up not being reported.

## Standalone Setup

If you're using Celery standalone, there are two ways to set this up:

- Initializing the SDK in the configuration file loaded with Celery's `--config` parameter
- Initializing the SDK by hooking it to either the [`celeryd_init`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/signals.html?#celeryd-init) or [`worker_init`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/signals.html?#worker-init) signals

  ```python
  import sentry_sdk
  from celery import Celery, signals

  app = Celery("myapp")

  #@signals.worker_init.connect
  @signals.celeryd_init.connect
  def init_sentry(**_kwargs):
      sentry_sdk.init(dsn="...")
  ```

## Setup With Django

If you're using Celery with Django in a conventional setup, have already initialized the SDK in [your `settings.py` file](/platforms/python/guides/django/#configure), and have Celery using the same settings with [`config_from_object`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/django/first-steps-with-django.html), you don't need to initialize the SDK separately for Celery.

## Verify

To verify if your SDK is initialized on worker start, you can pass `debug=True` to see extra output when the SDK is initialized. If the output appears during worker startup and not only after a task has started, then it's working properly.

<Alert level="info" title="Note on distributed tracing">

Sentry uses custom message headers for distributed tracing. For Celery versions 4.x, with [message protocol of version 1](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/internals/protocol.html#version-1), this functionality is broken, and Celery fails to propagate custom headers to the worker. Protocol version 2, which is the default since Celery version 4.0, is not affected.

The fix for the custom headers propagation issue was introduced to Celery project ([PR](https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/6374)) starting with version 5.0.1. However, the fix was not backported to versions 4.x.
