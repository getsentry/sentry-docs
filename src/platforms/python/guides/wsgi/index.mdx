_(New in version 0.6.0)_

It is recommended to use an <Link to="/platforms/python">integration for your particular WSGI framework if available</Link>, as those are easier to use and capture more useful information.

If you use a WSGI framework not directly supported by the SDK, or wrote a raw WSGI app, you can use this generic WSGI middleware. It captures errors and attaches a basic amount of information for incoming requests.

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.wsgi import SentryWsgiMiddleware

from myapp import wsgi_app

sentry_sdk.init(dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___")

wsgi_app = SentryWsgiMiddleware(wsgi_app)
```

## Behavior

- Request data is attached to all events: **HTTP method, URL, headers, form data, JSON payloads**. Sentry excludes raw bodies and multipart file uploads. Sentry also excludes personally identifiable information (such as user ids, usernames, cookies, authorization headers, IP addresses) unless you set `send_default_pii` to `True`.

Each request has a separate scope. Changes to the scope within a view, for example setting a tag, will only apply to events sent as part of the request being handled.

- The WSGI middleware does not behave like a regular integration. It is not initialized through an extra parameter to `init` and is not attached to a client. When capturing or supplementing events, it just uses the currently active hub.
