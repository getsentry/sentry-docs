The Flask integration adds support for the [Flask Web Framework](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/).

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI with the `flask` extra:

```bash
pip install --upgrade 'sentry-sdk[flask]'
```

## Configure

To configure the SDK, initialize it with the integration before or after your app has been initialized:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from flask import Flask
from sentry_sdk.integrations.flask import FlaskIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    integrations=[FlaskIntegration()]
)

app = Flask(__name__)
```

## Verify

Verify your Sentry installation by creating a route that triggers an error:

```py
@app.route('/debug-sentry')
def trigger_error():
    division_by_zero = 1 / 0
```

Visiting this route will trigger an error that will be captured by Sentry.

## Behavior

- The Sentry Python SDK will install the Flask integration for all of your apps. It hooks into Flask’s signals, not anything on the app object.

- All unhandled exceptions will be reported. Note that `@app.errorhandler(Exception)` will prevent all exceptions from being sent to Sentry while `@app.errorhandler(500)` will not.

- Request data is attached to all events: **HTTP method, URL, headers, form data, JSON payloads**. Sentry excludes raw bodies and multipart file uploads. Sentry also excludes personally identifiable information (such as user ids, usernames, cookies, authorization headers, IP addresses) unless you set `send_default_pii` to `True`.

- Each request has a separate scope. Changes to the scope within a view, for example setting a tag, will only apply to events sent as part of the request being handled.

- If you use `flask-login` and have set `send_default_pii=True` in your
  call to `init`, user data is attached to the event. Apart from the user ID
  we will try to access the attributes `email` and `username` on your user
  object to capture some more data.

- Logging with `app.logger` or _any_ logger will create breadcrumbs when
  the [Logging](/platforms/python/guides/logging/)
  integration is enabled (done by default).

## Options

You can pass the following keyword arguments to `FlaskIntegration()`:

- `transaction_style`:

  ```python
  @app.route("/myurl/<foo>")
  def myendpoint():
      return "ok"
  ```

  In the above code, you would set the transaction to:

  - `/myurl/&lt;foo&gt;` if you set `transaction_style="url"`. This matches the behavior of the old Raven SDK.
  - `myendpoint` if you set `transaction_style="endpoint"`

  The default is `"endpoint"`.

## User Feedback

You can use the user feedback feature with this integration. For more information see [User Feedback](enriching-events/user-feedback/).
