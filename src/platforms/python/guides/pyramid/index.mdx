_(New in version 0.5.0)_

The Pyramid integration adds support for the [Pyramid Web Framework](https://trypyramid.com/). It requires Pyramid 1.6 or later.

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI:

```bash
pip install --upgrade sentry-sdk
```

## Configure

To configure the SDK, initialize it with the integration before or after your app has been created:

```python
import sentry_sdk

from sentry_sdk.integrations.pyramid import PyramidIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    integrations=[PyramidIntegration()]
)

from pyramid.config import Configurator

with Configurator() as config:
    # ...
```

## Behavior

- The Sentry Python SDK will install the Pyramid integration for all of your apps. The integration hooks into Pyramid itself, not any of your apps specifically.

- The SDK will report all exceptions leading to an Internal Server Error. These two kinds of exceptions are:

  - exceptions that are not handled by any exception view
  - exceptions whose exception view returns a status code of 500 (Pyramid version 1.9+ only)

- Request data is attached to all events: **HTTP method, URL, headers, form data, JSON payloads**. Sentry excludes raw bodies and multipart file uploads. Sentry also excludes personally identifiable information (such as user ids, usernames, cookies, authorization headers, IP addresses) unless you set `send_default_pii` to `True`.

- Each request has a separate scope. Changes to the scope within a view, for example setting a tag, will only apply to events sent as part of the request being handled.

- Logging with _any_ logger will create breadcrumbs when
  the [Logging](/platforms/python/guides/logging/)
  integration is enabled (done by default).

## Options

You can pass the following keyword arguments to `PyramidIntegration()`:

- `transaction_style`:

  ```python
  config.add_route("myroute", "/myurl/{id}")
  config.add_view(myfunction, route_name="myroute")
  ```

  In the above code, you can set the transaction to:

  - `/myurl/{id}` if you set `transaction_style="route_pattern"`
  - `myroute` if you set `transaction_style="route_name"`

  The default is `"route_name"`.
