[Loguru](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru#readme) is a package for stupidly simple logging. The most of the work in
integration is handled by [`logging`](/platforms/python/guides/logging) integration, so the most of the examples there
will work with loguru.

Integration supports `0.5.0` (released in 2020-05-17) and upper.

The installation of integration is handled automatically on `sentry_sdk.init()` call. The same as with logging, you can
control what levels will be sent to Sentry.

```python
import sentry_sdk
from loguru import logger

# You can also import our enum with log levels, as it isn't in loguru itself.
from sentry_sdk.integrations.loguru import LoggingLevels, LoguruIntegration

# All of this is already happening by default!
sentry_loguru = LoguruIntegration(
    level=LoggingLevels.INFO.value,        # Capture info and above as breadcrumbs
    event_level=LoggingLevels.ERROR.value  # Send errors as events
)
sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    integrations=[
        sentry_loguru,
    ],

    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for performance monitoring.
    # We recommend adjusting this value in production,
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
)
```

## Usage

```python
from loguru import logger

logger.debug("I am ignored")
logger.info("I am a breadcrumb")
logger.error("I am an event", extra=dict(bar=43))
logger.exception("An exception happened")
```

- There will be an error event with the message `"I am an event"`.
- `"I am a breadcrumb"` will be attached as a breadcrumb to that event.
- `bar` will end up in the event's `extra` attributes.
- `"An exception happened"` will send the current exception from `sys.exc_info()` with the stack trace and everything to the Sentry Python SDK. If there's no exception, the current stack will be attached.
- The debug message `"I am ignored"` will not surface anywhere. To capture it, you need to lower `level` to `DEBUG` in `LoguruIntegration` args.

## Ignoring a logger

Sometimes a logger is extremely noisy and spams you with pointless errors. You can completely ignore that logger by calling `ignore_logger`:

```python
# As most of the logic is proxied to `logging` integration, we use it instead of `loguru` integration.
from sentry_sdk.integrations.logging import ignore_logger


ignore_logger("a.spammy.logger")

logger = logging.getLogger("a.spammy.logger")
logger.error("hi")  # no error sent to sentry
```

You can also use `before-send` and `before-breadcrumb` to ignore
only certain messages. See [_Filtering Events_](configuration/filtering/) for more information.

## Options

You can pass the following keyword arguments to `LoggingIntegration()`:

- `level` (default `INFO`): The Sentry Python SDK will record log records with a level higher than or equal to `level` as breadcrumbs. Inversely, the SDK completely ignores any log record with a level lower than this one. If a value of `None` occurs, the SDK won't send log records as breadcrumbs.

- `event_level` (default `ERROR`): The Sentry Python SDK will report log records with a level higher than or equal to `event_level` as events. If a value of `None` occurs, the SDK won't send log records as events.

<Alert level="info" title="Note">

Because of the Loguru's architecture, The Sentry Python SDK will log only levels provided into `LoguruIntegration`. So if your main logger (that outputs to stdout) configured to log trace messages too, you will not see them in Sentry reports.

</Alert>

## Handler classes

Instead of using `LoguruIntegration`, you can use two regular logging `logging.Handler` subclasses that the integration exports (`LoguruEventHandler` and `LoguruBreadcrumbHandler`).

**Usually, you don't need this.** You _can_ use this together with `default_integrations=False` if you want to opt into what the Sentry Python SDK captures. However, correctly setting up logging is difficult. Also, an opt-in approach to capturing data will miss errors you may not think of on your own.

See the [API documentation](https://getsentry.github.io/sentry-python/integrations.html#module-sentry_sdk.integrations.loguru) for more information.
