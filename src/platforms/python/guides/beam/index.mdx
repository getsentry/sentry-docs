_(New in version 0.11.0)_

The Beam integration currently parses the functions in [ParDo](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/release-2.13.0/sdks/python/apache_beam/transforms/core.py#L991) to return exceptions in their respective setup, start_bundle, process, and finish_bundle functions.

**This integration is experimental.** It may be removed in minor versions. When enabling this integration, expect to see incorrect server_name and ip due to some distributed properties within Beam.

A Beam version of 2.12 or later is required.

Add `BeamIntegration()` to your `integrations` list:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.beam import BeamIntegration

sentry_sdk.init("___PUBLIC_DSN___", integrations=[BeamIntegration()])
```

## Behavior

- The functions get injected with an inspect function to patch getting the [function signature](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/release-2.13.0/sdks/python/apache_beam/transforms/core.py#L288L298).

- The integration requires sentry to be installed on all the worker computers using a `--requirements_file`.

- The main computer invoking the pipeline requires the same version of sentry as the worker nodes.
