_(New in version 0.7.9)_

The Bottle integration adds support for the [Bottle Web Framework](https://bottlepy.org/).
Currently it works well with the stable version of Bottle (0.12).
However the integration with the development version (0.13) doesn't work properly.

1. Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI with the `bottle` extra:

   ```bash
   $ pip install --upgrade 'sentry-sdk[bottle]==0.16.2'
   ```

2. To configure the SDK, initialize it with the integration before your app has been initialized:

   ```python
   import sentry_sdk

   from bottle import Bottle, run
   from sentry_sdk.integrations.bottle import BottleIntegration

   sentry_sdk.init(
       dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
       integrations=[BottleIntegration()]
   )

   app = Bottle()
   ```

<!-- TODO-ADD-VERIFICATION-EXAMPLE -->

## Behavior

- The Sentry Python SDK will install the Bottle integration for all of your apps. The integration hooks into base Bottle class.

- All exceptions leading to an Internal Server Error are reported.

- Request data is attached to all events: **HTTP method, URL, headers, form data, JSON payloads**. Sentry excludes raw bodies and multipart file uploads. Sentry also excludes personally identifiable information (such as user ids, usernames, cookies, authorization headers, IP addresses) unless you set `send_default_pii` to `True`.

Each request has a separate scope. Changes to the scope within a view, for example setting a tag, will only apply to events sent as part of the request being handled.

## Options

You can pass the following keyword arguments to `BottleIntegration()`:

- `transaction_style`:

  ```python
  @app.route("/myurl/<foo>")
  def myendpoint():
      return "ok"
  ```

  In the above code, you would set the transaction to:

  - `/myurl/<foo>` if you set `transaction_style="url"`.
  - `myendpoint` if you set `transaction_style="endpoint"`

  The default is `"endpoint"`.
