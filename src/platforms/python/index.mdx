On this page, we provide concise information to get you up and running with Sentry's Python SDK, automatically reporting errors and exceptions in your application.

<Note><markdown>

If you don't already have an account and Sentry project established, head over to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/signup/), then return to this page.

## Install

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your application’s runtime. These are platform specific and allow Sentry to have a deep understanding of how your application works.

Install our Python SDK using `pip`:

```bash
$ pip install --upgrade sentry-sdk
```

The SDK provides support for Python 2.7 and 3.4 or later. [Integrations](#integrations) with specific frameworks (particularly asynchronous ones) may impose additional requirements though.

## Configure

After you’ve completed setting up a project in Sentry, Sentry will give you a value which we call a DSN or Data Source Name. It looks a lot like a standard URL, but it’s just a representation of the configuration required by the Sentry SDKs. It consists of a few pieces, including the protocol, public key, the server address, and the project identifier.

Import and initialize the Sentry SDK early in your application’s setup:

```python
import sentry_sdk
sentry_sdk.init(dsn='___PUBLIC_DSN___')
```

### Verify

Great! Now that you’ve completed setting up the SDK, maybe you want to quickly test out how Sentry works. Start by capturing an exception:

```python
sentry_sdk.capture_exception(Exception("This is an example of an error message."))
```

Once the exception is captured, you'll see the error in your Sentry dashboard.

## Usage

In Python you can either capture a caught exception or the one currently held in `sys.exc_info()` by not passing an argument:

```python
from sentry_sdk import capture_exception

try:
    a_potentially_failing_function()
except Exception as e:
    # Alternatively the argument can be omitted
    capture_exception(e)
```

## Monitor Performance

To get started with performance monitoring using Sentry's Python SDK, first install `sentry_sdk`:

```bash
pip install --upgrade sentry-sdk
```


Next, initialize the integration in your call to `sentry_sdk.init`:

```python
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    traces_sample_rate=1.0 # be sure to lower this in production to prevent quota issues
)
```

Performance data is transmitted using a new event type called "transactions", which you can learn about in [Distributed Tracing](/performance-monitoring/distributed-tracing/#traces-transactions-and-spans). **To capture transactions, you must install and configure your SDK to set the `traces_sample_rate` option to a nonzero value.** The example configuration above will transmit 100% of captured traces. Be sure to lower this value in production otherwise you could burn through your quota quickly.
