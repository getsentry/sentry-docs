description: GQL GraphQL client integration
---

The [GQL](https://gql.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) integration allows you to monitor all GraphQL requests that your Python application makes using the `gql` library. Specifically, this integration reports every [`TransportQueryError`](https://gql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/transport_exceptions.html#gql.transport.exceptions.TransportQueryError) to Sentry and provides additional context including:

- The URL the request was made to
- The GraphQL query which caused the error
- The `errors` information that the GraphQL server returns

## Install

Make sure you have the latest version of the Sentry SDK installed:

```bash
pip install --upgrade sentry-sdk
```

## Configure

To enable the integration, add `GQLIntegration()` to your `integrations` list, like so:

<SignInNote />

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.gql import GQLIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    integrations=[
        GQLIntegration(),
    ],
    # Uncomment the following line to send GraphQL
    # queries and error information to Sentry:
    #
    # send_default_pii=True,
)
```

## Data Privacy and the GQL Integration

To ensure data privacy, the SDK avoids sending any information that may potentially contain personally identifiable information (PII) by default. See the docs for the [`send_default_pii` flag](/platforms/python/configuration/options/#send-default-pii) for more information.

For the GQL integration, this policy means that the SDK **doesn't send** the GraphQL queries and the `errors` information that the GraphQL server returns, unless you override the default configuration via the `send_default_pii` flag.

<Alert level="warning">

Before enabling the `send_default_pii` flag, ensure you've configured Sentry's [sensitive data scrubbing](/platforms/python/data-management/sensitive-data/) tools to scrub all PII.

</Alert>

To have Sentry record the GraphQL queries and the `errors` information returned by the GraphQL server, uncomment the `send_default_pii=True` line in the code snippet above.
