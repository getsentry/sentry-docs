_(New in version 0.10.0)_

The Redis integration hooks into the [Redis client for Python](https://pypi.org/project/redis/) and logs all Redis commands as <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/">breadcrumbs</PlatformLink>.

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.redis import RedisIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn='___PUBLIC_DSN___',
    integrations=[RedisIntegration()]
)
```
