The [Redis](https://redis.io/) integration hooks into the [Redis client for Python](https://pypi.org/project/redis/) and logs all Redis commands as <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/">breadcrumbs</PlatformLink>.

## Install

```bash
pip install --upgrade 'sentry-sdk'
```

## Configure

If you have the `redis` Python package in your dependencies, the Redis integration will be enabled automatically. There is nothing to do for you except initializing the Sentry SDK.

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.redis import RedisIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn='___PUBLIC_DSN___',
)
```

## Behavior

With Redis integration the following information will be available to you on Sentry.io:

- Performance information about requests to redis will be available in the waterfall diagram in the Performance section on Sentry.io.
- Redis commands will be added as breadcrumbs.
- If `send_default_pii` is set to `True` you will also see the data used in your redis requests.
- Data of the `AUTH` command will never be collected.

## Integration Options

If you want to change the default behavior of the Redis integration, you need to instantiate the integration manually to pass options to the integration and then pass it to Sentry's init function.

<ConfigKey name="max_data_size">

By default `RedisIntegration()` will trim data collected after `1024` characters. You can change this behavior with the `max_data_size` parameter:

- When you set `max_data_size` to a value that evaluates to `False` (like `0` or `None`) no trimming will take place.
- You can set `max_data_size` to an integer to control how many characters should be collected.

Example for disabling data trimming, the whole Redis command will be recorded:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.redis import RedisIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn='___PUBLIC_DSN___',
    integrations=[
        RedisIntegration(max_data_size=None),
    ]
)
```

Example of keeping just a maximum of 50 characters of Redis commands:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.redis import RedisIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn='___PUBLIC_DSN___',
    integrations=[
        RedisIntegration(max_data_size=50),
    ]
)
```

</ConfigKey>
