The [Loguru](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru#readme) integration lets you capture log messages and send them to Sentry.

Most of the work is handled by the [`logging`](/platforms/python/guides/logging) integration, so most of the examples there will work with loguru.

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI with the `loguru` extra.

```bash
pip install --upgrade 'sentry-sdk[loguru]'
```

## Configure

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.loguru import LoguruIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    integrations=[
        LoguruIntegration(),
    ],
)
```


## Behavior

By default log records with a level of `INFO` or higher will be added as breadcrumbs to Sentry events. For log records with a level of `ERROR` or higher a Sentry issue will be created:

```python
from loguru import logger

logger.debug("I am ignored")
logger.info("I am a breadcrumb")
logger.error("I am an event", extra=dict(bar=43))
logger.exception("An exception happened")
```

- There will be an error event with the message `"I am an event"`.
- `"I am a breadcrumb"` will be attached as a breadcrumb to that event.
- `bar` will end up in the `extra` attributes of that event.
- `"An exception happened"` will send the current exception from `sys.exc_info()` with the stack trace to the Sentry. If there's no exception, the current stack will be attached.
- The debug message `"I am ignored"` will not be captured by Sentry. To capture it, you need to lower `level` to `DEBUG` in `LoguruIntegration`.

### Ignoring a logger

Sometimes a logger can be noisy. You can ignore that logger by calling `ignore_logger`:

```python
# As most of the logic is proxied to `logging` integration, we use it instead of `loguru` integration.
from sentry_sdk.integrations.logging import ignore_logger

ignore_logger("a.spammy.logger")

# and with loguru (in `a.spammy.logger` module)
from loguru import logger
logger.error("hi")  # again, no record
```

You can also use `before-send` and `before-breadcrumb` to ignore only certain messages. See <PlatformLink to="/configuration/filtering/">Filtering Events</PlatformLink> for more information.

## Options

You can pass the following keyword arguments to `LoguruIntegration()`:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from loguru import logger

from sentry_sdk.integrations.loguru import LoguruIntegration
from sentry_sdk.integrations.loguru import LoggingLevels

sentry_loguru = LoguruIntegration(
    level=LoggingLevels.INFO.value,        # Capture info and above as breadcrumbs
    event_level=LoggingLevels.ERROR.value  # Send errors as events
)

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    integrations=[
        sentry_loguru,
    ],
)
```

<ConfigKey name="level">

The Sentry Python SDK will record log records with a level higher than or equal to `level` as breadcrumbs. Inversely, the SDK completely ignores any log record with a level lower than this one. If set to `None`, the SDK won't send log records as breadcrumbs.

- Default: `INFO`

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="event_level">

The Sentry Python SDK will report log records with a level higher than or equal to `event_level` as events. If set to `None`, the SDK won't send log records as events.

- Default: `ERROR`


</ConfigKey>
