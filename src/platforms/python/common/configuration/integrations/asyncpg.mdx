The asyncpg integration captures queries from
[asyncpg](https://github.com/MagicStack/asyncpg), which can be viewed in Sentry's **Performance** page.

## Install

To get started, install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI.

```bash
pip install --upgrade sentry-sdk[asyncpg]
```

## Configure

Add `AsyncPGIntegration()` to your `integrations` list:

<SignInNote />

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.asyncpg import AsyncPGIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for performance monitoring.
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
    integrations=[
        AsyncPGIntegration(),
    ],
)
```

## Verify

```python
import asyncpg

async def main():
    sentry_sdk.init(...)  # same as above

    with sentry_sdk.start_transaction(name="testing_sentry"):
        conn = await asyncpg.connect(DATABASE_URL)
        await conn.fetch("SELECT * FROM pg_catalog.pg_tables;")
        await conn.close()

asyncio.run(main())
```

This will create a transaction called `testing_sentry` in the Performance section of Sentry and will create spans for the `connect` and the `SELECT` operations.

It takes a couple moments until the data shows up in Sentry.

## Supported Versions

- asyncpg: 0.23+
