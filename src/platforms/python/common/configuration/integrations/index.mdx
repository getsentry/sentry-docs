Sentry provides a number of integrations which are designed to add automatic instrumentation to your application.

The Sentry Python SDK also tries to automatically enable integrations that fit the Python modules you have installed. If you have a popular web framework like [Django](/platforms/python/guides/django/), [Flask](/platforms/python/guides/flask/), [FastAPI](/platforms/python/guides/fastapi/) or others installed, the Sentry SDK will enable the respective integrations by default for you without any further configuration.

If you don't want integrations to be enabled automatically, set the `default_integrations` parameter to `False`. Learn more about <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#integration-configuration">integration options</PlatformLink>.
