The [HTTPX](https://www.python-httpx.org/) integration instruments outgoing HTTP requests using either the sync or the async HTTPX clients.

Use this integration to create spans for outgoing requests and ensure traces are properly propagated to downstream services.

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI with the `httpx` extra.

```bash
pip install --upgrade 'sentry-sdk[httpx]'
```

## Configure

Add `HttpxIntegration()` to your `integrations` list:

<SignInNote />

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.httpx import HttpxIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    integrations=[
        HttpxIntegration(),
    ],
)
```

## Options

You can pass the following keyword arguments to `HttpxIntegration()`:

- `capture_graphql_errors`:

If enabled, the SDK will automatically create an error event whenever the response
  to a request to an endpoint called `/graphql` contains an `errors` array. The
  error event will have both the request and the response content if the SDK has
  been set up with `send_default_pii=True` (which is the default). If you don't want to capture client GraphQL errors, set `send_default_pii=False`.

  The default is `True`. Set to `False` to stop capturing client GraphQL errors.

## Supported Versions

- HTTPX: 0.16+
- Python: 3.6+
