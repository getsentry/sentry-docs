_(New in version 1.2.0)_

The HTTPX integration instruments outgoing HTTP requests using either the sync or the async [HTTPX](https://www.python-httpx.org/) clients.

Use this integration to create spans for outgoing requests and ensure traces are properly propagated to downstream services.

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.httpx import HttpxIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    integrations=[HttpxIntegration()]
)
```
