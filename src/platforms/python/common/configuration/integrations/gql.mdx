The [gql](https://gql.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) integration allows you to monitor all GraphQL requests that your Python application makes using the `gql` library. Specifically, this integration reports every [`TransportQueryError`](https://gql.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/transport_exceptions.html#gql.transport.exceptions.TransportQueryError) to Sentry and provides additional context including the URL the request was made to, GraphQL query which caused the error, and the `errors` information that the GraphQL server returns.

## Install

Make sure you have the latest version of the Sentry SDK installed:

```bash
pip install --upgrade sentry-sdk
```

## Configure

To enable the integration, add `GQLIntegration()` to your `integrations` list, like so:

<SignInNote />

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.gql import GQLIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    integrations=[
        GQLIntegration(),
    ],
    # Uncomment the following line to send GraphQL
    # queries and error information to Sentry:
    #
    # send_default_pii=True,
)
```

### Data Privacy & The `gql` Integration

To ensure data privacy, the [SDK avoids sending any information which may potentially contain personally identifiable information (PII)](/platforms/python/configuration/options/#send-default-pii) by default.

For the `gql` integration, this policy means that the SDK **refrains from sending the GraphQL queries and the `errors` information** that the GraphQL server returns unless you override the default configuration via the `send_default_pii` flag.

<Alert level="warning">
  Prior to enabling the <code>send_default_pii</code> flag, please ensure that
  you have configured Sentry's{" "}
  <a href="/platforms/python/data-management/sensitive-data/">
    sensitive data scrubbing
  </a>{" "}
  tools properly to scrub all PII.
</Alert>

If you would like Sentry to record the GraphQL queries and the `errors` information returned by the GraphQL server, you can uncomment the `send_default_pii=True` line in the code snippet above.
