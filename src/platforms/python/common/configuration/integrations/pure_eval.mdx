This integration uses [`pure_eval`](https://github.com/alexmojaki/pure_eval) to safely evaluate additional expressions in the source code and display their values alongside other local variables.

<Note>

**This integration is experimental.** It may be removed in minor versions.

</Note>

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI with the `pure_eval` extra or `pip install pure_eval executing asttokens`.

```bash
pip install --upgrade 'sentry-sdk[pure_eval]'
```

## Configure

Add `PureEvalIntegration()` to your `integrations` list:

<SignInNote />

from sentry_sdk.integrations.pure_eval import PureEvalIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dns="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    integrations=[
        PureEvalIntegration(),
    ],
)
```
