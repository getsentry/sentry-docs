<!-- NOTE: Due to being in common, redirects are in vercel.json -->

The SQLAlchemy integration captures queries from
[SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) as breadcrumbs. The integration is
being tested with SQLAlchemy 1.2 or later.

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI with the `sqlalchemy` extra.

```bash
pip install --upgrade 'sentry-sdk[sqlalchemy]'
```

## Configure

Add `SqlalchemyIntegration()` to your `integrations` list:

<SignInNote />

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.sqlalchemy import SqlalchemyIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    integrations=[
        SqlalchemyIntegration(),
    ],
)
```

## Supported Versions

- SQLAlchemy: 1.2+
- Python: 2.7+
