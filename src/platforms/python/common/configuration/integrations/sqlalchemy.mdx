_(New in version 0.11.0)_

The SQLAlchemy integration captures queries from
[SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) as breadcrumbs. The integration is
being tested with SQLAlchemy 1.2 or later.

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.sqlalchemy import SqlalchemyIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    integrations=[SqlalchemyIntegration()]
)
```
