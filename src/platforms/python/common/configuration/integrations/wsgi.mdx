If you use a WSGI framework not directly supported by the SDK, or wrote a raw WSGI app, you can use this generic WSGI middleware. It captures errors and attaches a basic amount of information for incoming requests.

<Note>

If you use an WSGI framework, please use our specific integrations for [Flask](/platforms/python/guides/flask/), [Bottle](/platforms/python/guides/bottle/), [Falcon](/platforms/python/guides/falcon/), [Pyramid](/platforms/python/guides/pyramid/), and [Tryton](/platforms/python/guides/tryton/) instead of this WSGI middleware as those are easier to use and capture more useful information.

</Note>

## Install

```bash
pip install --upgrade 'sentry-sdk'
```

## Configure

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.wsgi import SentryWsgiMiddleware

from myapp import wsgi_app

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",

    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for performance monitoring.
    # We recommend adjusting this value in production,
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
)

wsgi_app = SentryWsgiMiddleware(wsgi_app)
```

## Behavior

- Request data is attached to all events: **HTTP method, URL, headers**. Sentry excludes raw bodies and multipart file uploads. Sentry also excludes personally identifiable information (such as user ids, usernames, cookies, authorization headers, IP addresses) unless you set `send_default_pii` to `True`.

Each request has a separate scope. Changes to the scope within a view, for example setting a tag, will only apply to events sent as part of the request being handled.

- The WSGI middleware does not behave like a regular integration. It is not initialized through an extra parameter to `init` and is not attached to a client. When capturing or supplementing events, it just uses the currently active hub.

## Supported Versions

- Python: 2.7+
