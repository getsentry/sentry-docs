Event and Breadcrumb `hints` are objects containing various information used to put together an event or a breadcrumb. These hints are passed as the `hint` parameter to `before_send` and `before_breadcrumb` (as well as event processors) as a dictionary. More than one hint can be supplied, but this is rare.

`exc_info`

: If you set this hint, then it's an exc info tuple in the form `(exc_type, exc_value, tb)`. This can be used to extract additional information from the original error object.

`log_record`

: This hint is passed to breadcrumbs and contains the log record that created it. It can be used to extract additional information from the original `logging` log record that is not extracted by default. Likewise, it can be useful to discard uninteresting breadcrumbs.

`httplib_request`

: An `httplib` request object for breadcrumbs created from HTTP requests.
