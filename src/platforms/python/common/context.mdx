Sentry supports additional context with events. Often this context is shared
among any issue captured in its lifecycle, and includes the following
components:

**Structured Contexts**

: Structured contexts are typically set automatically.

[**User**](#capturing-the-user)

: Information about the current actor.

[**Tags**](#tagging-events)

: Key/value pairs which generate breakdown charts and search filters.

[**Level**](#setting-the-level)

: An event's severity.

[**Fingerprint**](#setting-the-fingerprint)

: A value used for grouping events into issues.

[**Unstructured Extra Data**](#extra-context)

: Arbitrary unstructured data which the Sentry SDK stores with an event sample.

Sentry will try its best to accommodate the data you send it, but large context
payloads will be trimmed or may be truncated entirely. For more details see the
[data handling SDK documentation](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/data-handling/)

## Setting Context

In addition to the structured context that Sentry understands, you can send arbitrary key/value pairs of data which the Sentry SDK will store alongside the event. These are not indexed, and the Sentry SDK uses them to add additional information about what might be happening.

`.set_context()` will take an object as the second argument and place the object inside `contexts` in the event payload.

```python
from sentry_sdk import configure_scope

with configure_scope() as scope:
    scope.set_context("my_cool_data", {"foo": "bar"})
```

## Extra Context

`.set_extra()` is similar to `.set_context()`, however it doesn't have reserved keys.

```python
from sentry_sdk import configure_scope

with configure_scope() as scope:
    scope.set_extra("character_name", "Mighty Fighter")
```

## Unsetting Context

Context is held in the current scope and thus is cleared out at the end of each operation — request, etc. You can also append and pop your own scopes to apply context data to a specific code block or function. Typically, unsetting context happens within an integration. For more information, see our [Python integrations](#integrations).

There are two different scopes for unsetting context — a global scope which Sentry does not discard at the end of an operation, and a scope that can be created by the user.

```python
from sentry_sdk import configure_scope, push_scope, capture_exception

# This will be changed for all future events
with configure_scope() as scope:
    scope.user = some_user

with push_scope() as scope:
    # This will be changed only for the error caught inside and automatically discarded afterward
    scope.user = some_user
    capture_exception(...)
```

## Identifying the User

Sending users to Sentry will unlock many features, primarily the ability to
drill down into the number of users affecting an issue, as well as to get a
broader sense about the quality of the application.

```python
from sentry_sdk import configure_scope

with configure_scope() as scope:
    scope.user = {"email": "john.doe@example.com"}
```

Users consist of a few critical pieces of information which are used to
construct a unique identity in Sentry. Each of these is optional, but
one **must** be present for the Sentry SDK to capture the user:

`id`

: Your internal identifier for the user.

`username`

: The user's username. Generally used as a better label than the internal ID.

`email`

: An alternative, or addition, to a username. Sentry is aware of email addresses
and can show things like Gravatars, unlock messaging capabilities, and more.

`ip_address`

: The IP address of the user. If the user is unauthenticated, providing the IP
address will suggest that this is unique to that IP. If available, we will
attempt to pull this from the HTTP request data.

Additionally, you can provide arbitrary key/value pairs beyond the reserved
names, and the Sentry SDK will store those with the user.

### Tagging Events

Tags are key/value pairs assigned to events that can be used for breaking down
issues or quick access to finding related events.

Most SDKs generally support configuring tags by configuring the scope:

```python
from sentry_sdk import configure_scope

with configure_scope() as scope:
    scope.set_tag("page_locale", "de-at")
```

For more information, see the [Tagging Events section](/enriching-error-data/additional-data/#tags) in Context.

## Setting the Level

You can set the severity of an event to one of five values: fatal, error, warning, info, and debug. error is the default, fatal is the most severe, and debug is the least severe.

```python
from sentry_sdk import configure_scope

with configure_scope() as scope:
    scope.level = 'warning'
```

## Setting the Fingerprint

Sentry uses a fingerprint to decide how to group errors into issues.

For some very advanced use cases, you can override the Sentry default grouping using the `fingerprint` attribute. In supported SDKs, this attribute can be passed with the event information and should be an array of strings.

If you wish to append information, thus making the grouping slightly less aggressive, you can do that as well by adding the special string `{{default}}` as one of the items.

For code samples, see the [Grouping & Fingerprints](/data-management/event-grouping/?platform=python#use-cases) page.
