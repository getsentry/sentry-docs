On this page, we get you up and running with Sentry's SDK.

Sentry's Python SDK enables automatic reporting of errors and performance data in your application.

Don't already have an account and Sentry project established? Head over to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/signup/), then return to this page.

<Note>

If you are still using our legacy "Raven" SDK, you can access the <Link rel={`nofollow`} to={`/platforms/python/legacy-sdk/`}>legacy SDK documentation</Link>, until further notice. Migrating from older versions is documented [here](./migration/).

</Note>

## Install

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your applicationâ€™s runtime.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-install" />

## Configure

Configuration should happen as early as possible in your application's lifecycle.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-config" />


## Verify

This snippet includes an intentional error, so you can test that everything is working as soon as you set it up.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-verify" />

To view and resolve the recorded error, log into [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and open your project. Clicking on the error's title will open a page where you can see detailed information and mark it as resolved.
