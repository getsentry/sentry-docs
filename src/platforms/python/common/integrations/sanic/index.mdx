The Sanic integration adds support for the [Sanic Web Framework](https://sanic.dev/).

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI with the `sanic` extra:

```bash
pip install --upgrade sentry-sdk[sanic]
```

If you're on Python 3.6, you also need the `aiocontextvars` package:

```bash
pip install --upgrade aiocontextvars
```

## Configure

If you have the `sanic` package in your dependencies, the Sanic integration will be enabled automatically when you initialize the Sentry SDK.

<SignInNote />

```python
from sanic import Sanic
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for performance monitoring.
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
)

app = Sanic(__name__)
```

### Configuration options

If you're using performance monitoring, you can configure the Sanic integration to not send transactions for requests that resulted in certain HTTP statuses using the `unsampled_statuses` option.

By default, the Sanic integration generates transactions for all requests, except requests that result in a 404 HTTP status. To generate transactions for all HTTP statuses, including 404, or change which HTTP statuses don't generate transactions, you can manually instantiate the Sanic integration when initializing the Sentry SDK, like so:

```python
from sanic import Sanic
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.sanic import SanicIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",

    # Configure the Sanic integration so that we
    # generate transactions for all HTTP statuses,
    # including 404
    integrations=[SanicIntegration(unsampled_statuses=None)]

    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for performance monitoring.
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
)
```

To specify a different set of HTTP statuses for which no transactions should be generated, set `unsampled_statuses` to a set containing the HTTP statuses that don't generate transactions. For example, if you wish to have no transactions for requests resulting in a 200 or 404 HTTP status, use `SanicIntegration(unsampled_statuses={200, 400})`.

## Verify

```python
from sanic import Sanic
from sanic.response import text

sentry_sdk.init(...)  # same as above

app = Sanic(__name__)

@app.get("/")
async def hello_world(request):
    1 / 0  # raises an error
    return text("Hello, world.")`
```

When you point your browser to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) an error event will be sent to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

## Behavior

- The Sentry Python SDK will install the Sanic integration for all of your apps.

- All exceptions leading to an Internal Server Error are reported.

- Request data is attached to all events: **HTTP method, URL, headers, form data, JSON payloads**. Sentry excludes raw bodies and multipart file uploads. Sentry also excludes personally identifiable information (such as user ids, usernames, cookies, authorization headers, IP addresses) unless you set `send_default_pii` to `True`.

- Each request has a separate scope. Changes to the scope within a view, for example setting a tag, will only apply to events sent as part of the request being handled.

- Logging with any logger will create breadcrumbs when
  the [Logging](/platforms/python/integrations/logging/)
  integration is enabled (done by default).

## Supported Versions

- Sanic: 0.8+
- Python: 3.6+ (Sanic 0.8+), 3.7+ (Sanic 21.0+)
