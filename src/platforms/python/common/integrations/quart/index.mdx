The Quart integration adds support for the [Quart Web Framework](https://gitlab.com/pgjones/quart).

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI with the `quart` extra:

```bash
pip install --upgrade sentry-sdk[quart]
```

## Configure

To configure the SDK, initialize it with the integration before or after your app has been initialized:

<SignInNote />

```python
from quart import Quart

import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.quart import QuartIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for performance monitoring.
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
    integrations=[
        QuartIntegration(),
    ],
)

app = Quart(__name__)
```

# Verify

```python
from quart import Quart

sentry_sdk.init(...)  # same as above

app = Quart(__name__)

@app.route("/")
async def hello():
    1/0  # raises an error
    return {"hello": "world"}

app.run()
```

When you point your browser to [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/) a transaction in the Performance section of [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) will be created. Additionally, an error event will be sent to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and will be connected to the transaction.

It takes a couple of moments for the data to appear in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

## Behavior

- The Sentry Python SDK will install the Quart integration for all of your apps.

- All exceptions leading to an Internal Server Error, from before/after serving functions, and background tasks are reported.

- Request data is attached to all events: **HTTP method, URL, headers**. Sentry also excludes personally identifiable information (such as user IDs, usernames, cookies, authorization headers, IP addresses) unless you set `send_default_pii` to `True`.

- Each request has a separate scope. Changes to the scope within a view, for example setting a tag, will only apply to events sent as part of the request being handled.

- Logging with any logger will create breadcrumbs when the [Logging](/platforms/python/integrations/logging/) integration is enabled (done by default).

## Supported Versions

- Quart: 0.16.1+
- Python: 3.7+
