description: "Learn about the gRPC integration and how it adds support for the grpcio grpc client and server."
---

The [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) integration instruments all incoming requests and outgoing unary-unary, unary-stream grpc
requests using grpcio channels.

Use this integration to start or continue transactions for incoming grpc requests, create spans for outgoing requests,
and ensure traces are properly propagated to downstream services.

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI with the `grpcio` extra.

```bash
pip install --upgrade 'sentry-sdk[grpcio]'
```

## Configure

Add appropriate interceptor to your grpc stub/server:

<SignInNote />

### Server

```python
import grpc

import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.grpc.server import ServerInterceptor

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for performance monitoring.
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
)

...

server = grpc.server(
    thread_pool=...,
    interceptors=[ServerInterceptor()],
)
```

### Client

```python
import grpc

import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.grpc.client import ClientInterceptor

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for performance monitoring.
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
)

...

with grpc.insecure_channel("example.com:12345") as channel:
    channel = grpc.intercept_channel(channel, *[ClientInterceptor()])
```

## Verify

### Server

If you added the interceptor as described above, the server will create a transaction that will show up in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

It takes a couple of moments for the data to appear in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

### Client

```python
import grpc

sentry_sdk.init(...)  # same as above

...

with sentry_sdk.start_transaction(op="function", name="grcp_client"):
    with grpc.insecure_channel("example.com:12345") as channel:
        channel = grpc.intercept_channel(channel, *[ClientInterceptor()])
        stub = helloworld_pb2_grpc.GreeterStub(channel)
        response = stub.SayHello(helloworld_pb2.HelloRequest(name="you"))

```

This will create a transaction called `testing_sentry` in the Performance section of [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and will create a span for the call to the `SayHello` method on the server.

It takes a couple of moments for the data to appear in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).
