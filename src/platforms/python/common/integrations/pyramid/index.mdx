The Pyramid integration adds support for the [Pyramid Web Framework](https://trypyramid.com/).

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI:

```bash
pip install --upgrade sentry-sdk
```

## Configure

If you have the `pyramid` package in your dependencies, the Pyramid integration will be enabled automatically when you initialize the Sentry SDK.

<SignInNote />

```python
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for performance monitoring.
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
)

from pyramid.config import Configurator

with Configurator() as config:
    # ...
```

## Verify

```python
from wsgiref.simple_server import make_server
from pyramid.config import Configurator
from pyramid.response import Response

sentry_sdk.init(...)  # same as above

def hello_world(request):
    1/0  # raises an error
    return Response('Hello World!')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    with Configurator() as config:
        config.add_route('hello', '/')
        config.add_view(hello_world, route_name='hello')
        app = config.make_wsgi_app()

    server = make_server('0.0.0.0', 6543, app)
    server.serve_forever()
```

When you point your browser to [http://localhost:6543/](http://localhost:6543/) an error event will be sent to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

## Behavior

- The Sentry Python SDK will install the Pyramid integration for all of your apps. The integration hooks into Pyramid itself, not any of your apps specifically.

- The SDK will report all exceptions leading to an Internal Server Error. These two kinds of exceptions are:

  - exceptions that are not handled by any exception view
  - exceptions whose exception view returns a status code of 500 (Pyramid version 1.9+ only)

- Request data is attached to all events: **HTTP method, URL, headers, form data, JSON payloads**. Sentry excludes raw bodies and multipart file uploads. Sentry also excludes personally identifiable information (such as user ids, usernames, cookies, authorization headers, IP addresses) unless you set `send_default_pii` to `True`.

- Each request has a separate scope. Changes to the scope within a view, for example setting a tag, will only apply to events sent as part of the request being handled.

- Logging with _any_ logger will create breadcrumbs when
  the [Logging](/platforms/python/integrations/logging/)
  integration is enabled (done by default).

## Options

By adding `PyramidIntegration` to your `sentry_sdk.init()` call explicitly, you can set options for `PyramidIntegration` to change its behavior:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.pyramid import PyramidIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for performance monitoring.
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
    integrations=[
        PyramidIntegration(
            transaction_style="route_pattern",
        )
    ]
)
```

You can pass the following keyword arguments to `PyramidIntegration()`:

- `transaction_style`:

  ```python
  config.add_route("myroute", "/myurl/{id}")
  config.add_view(myfunction, route_name="myroute")
  ```

  In the above code, you can set the transaction to:

  - `/myurl/{id}` if you set `transaction_style="route_pattern"`
  - `myroute` if you set `transaction_style="route_name"`

  The default is `"route_name"`.

## Supported Versions

- Pyramid: 1.6+
