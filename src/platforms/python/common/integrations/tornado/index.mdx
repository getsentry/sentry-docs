The Tornado integration adds support for the [Tornado Web Framework](https://www.tornadoweb.org/).

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI with the `tornado` extra:

```bash
pip install --upgrade sentry-sdk[tornado]
```

If you're on Python 3.6, you also need the `aiocontextvars` package:

```bash
pip install --upgrade aiocontextvars
```

## Configure

If you have the `tornado` package in your dependencies, the Tornado integration will be enabled automatically when you initialize the Sentry SDK.

<SignInNote />

```python
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for performance monitoring.
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
)

class MainHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    # ...
```

## Verify

```python
import asyncio
import tornado

sentry_sdk.init(...)  # same as above

class MainHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    def get(self):
        1/0  # raises an error
        self.write("Hello, world")

def make_app():
    return tornado.web.Application([
        (r"/", MainHandler),
    ])

async def main():
    app = make_app()
    app.listen(8888)
    await asyncio.Event().wait()

asyncio.run(main())
```

When you point your browser to [http://localhost:8888/](http://localhost:8888/) a transaction in the Performance section of [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) will be created. Additionally, an error event will be sent to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and will be connected to the transaction.

It takes a couple of moments for the data to appear in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

## Behavior

- The Tornado integration will be installed for all of your apps and handlers.

- All exceptions leading to a Internal Server Error are reported.

- Request data is attached to all events: **HTTP method, URL, headers, form data, JSON payloads**. Sentry excludes raw bodies and multipart file uploads. Sentry also excludes personally identifiable information (such as user ids, usernames, cookies, authorization headers, IP addresses) unless you set `send_default_pii` to `True`.

- Each request has a separate scope. Changes to the scope within a view, for example setting a tag, will only apply to events sent as part of the request being handled.

- Logging with any logger will create breadcrumbs when
  the [Logging](/platforms/python/integrations/logging/)
  integration is enabled (done by default).

## Supported Versions

- Tornado: 5+
- Python: 2.7+
