---

The Cloud Resource Context integration adds information about the cloud platform your app runs to errors and performance events. Currently [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) and [Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute) are supported.

## Install

To install it, run:

```bash
pip install --upgrade 'sentry-sdk'
```

## Configure

Add `CloudResourceContextIntegration()` to your `integrations` list:

<SignInNote />

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.cloud_resource_context import CloudResourceContextIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for performance monitoring.
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
    integrations=[
        CloudResourceContextIntegration(),
    ],
)
```

## Verify

Trigger an error in the code running in your cloud and see the error and performance data show up in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io). It takes a couple of moments for the performance data to show up in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

## Behavior

When the SDK starts up, information from the cloud provider the app is running in is retrieved and added to all error and performance events sent to Sentry.
The [developer documentation](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/event-payloads/contexts/#runtime-context) lists all the information that's being added.

In AWS EC2 the context looks like this:

In Google Cloud Platform GCE the context looks like this:

## Supported Versions

- Python: 3.6+
- Cloud platforms: Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine
