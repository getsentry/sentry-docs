The GNU backtrace integration parses native stack trace produced by [`backtrace_symbols`](https://linux.die.net/man/3/backtrace_symbols) from error messages and concatenates them with the Python traceback.

It is currently tested to work with server exceptions raised by [`clickhouse-driver`](https://github.com/mymarilyn/clickhouse-driver).

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI.

```bash
pip install --upgrade 'sentry-sdk'
```

## Configure

Add `GnuBacktraceIntegration()` to your `integrations` list:

<SignInNote />

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.gnu_backtrace import GnuBacktraceIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    integrations=[
        GnuBacktraceIntegration(),
    ],
)
```

## Verify

The GNU backtrace integration is tested with server exceptions raised by [`clickhouse-driver`](https://github.com/mymarilyn/clickhouse-driver).

Other libraries must emit exceptions that have backtrace-compatible values for the GNU backtrace integration to parse the exceptions.
