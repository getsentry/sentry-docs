Sentry Crons allows you to monitor the uptime and performance of any scheduled, recurring job. Once implemented, it'll allow you to get alerts and metrics to help you solve errors, detect timeouts, and prevent disruptions to your service.

## Celery Beat Auto Discovery

Use the Celery integration to monitor your [Celery periodic tasks](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/periodic-tasks.html) and get notified when a task is missed (or doesn't start when expected), if it fails due to a problem in the runtime (such as an error), or if it fails by exceeding its maximum runtime.

First, set up your Celery beat schedule:

```python
# tasks.py
from celery import Celery
from celery.schedules import crontab


app = Celery('tasks', broker='...')
app.conf.beat_schedule = {
    'set-in-beat-schedule': {
        'task': 'tasks.tell_the_world',
        'schedule': crontab(hour='10', minute='15'),
        'args': ("Some important message!", ),
    },
}
```

Initialize Sentry in the `celeryd_init` or `beat_init` signal. Make sure to set `monitor_beat_tasks=True` in `CeleryIntegration`:

<SignInNote />

```python
# tasks.py
from celery import signals

import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.celery import CeleryIntegration


#@signals.beat_init.connect
@signals.celeryd_init.connect
def init_sentry(**kwargs):
    sentry_sdk.init(
        dsn='___PUBLIC_DSN___',
        integrations=[CeleryIntegration(monitor_beat_tasks=True)],  # ðŸ‘ˆ
        environment="local.dev.grace",
        release="v1.0",
    )
```

Once Sentry Crons is set up, tasks in your Celery beat schedule will be auto-discoverable, and telemetry data will be captured when a task is started, when it finishes, and when it fails.

Start your Celery beat and worker services and see your tasks being monitored at [https://sentry.io/crons/](https://sentry.io/crons/).

<Note>

You don't need to create Cron Monitors for your tasks on Sentry.io, we'll do it for you.

### Excluding Celery Beat Tasks from Auto Discovery

You can exclude Celery Beat tasks from being auto-instrumented. To do this, add a list of tasks you want to exclude as option `exclude_beat_tasks` when creating `CeleryIntegration`. The list can contain simple strings with the full task name, as specified in the Celery Beat schedule, or regular expressions to match multiple tasks.

<SignInNote />

```python
    exclude_beat_tasks = [
        "some-task-a",
        "payment-check-.*",
    ]

    sentry_sdk.init(
        dsn='___PUBLIC_DSN___',
        integrations=[
            CeleryIntegration(
                monitor_beat_tasks=True,
                exclude_beat_tasks=exclude_beat_tasks),
            ],
        environment="local.dev.grace",
        release="v1.0",
    )
```

In this example the task `some-task-a` and all tasks with a name starting with `payment-check-` will be ignored.

For more information, see the documentation for <PlatformLink to="/#options">options on CeleryIntegration</PlatformLink>.

## Manual Task Monitoring

We provide a lightweight decorator to make monitoring individual tasks easier. To use it, add `@sentry_sdk.monitor` to your Celery task (or any function), then supply a `monitor_slug` of a monitor created previously on Sentry.io. Once this is done, every time the task (or function) is executed, telemetry data will be captured when a task is started, when it finishes, and when it fails.

<Note>

Make sure the Sentry `@sentry_sdk.monitor` decorator is below Celery's `@app.task` decorator.

```python
# tasks.py
from celery import Celery, signals

import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.celery import CeleryIntegration


app = Celery('tasks', broker='...')


@signals.celeryd_init.connect
def init_sentry(**kwargs):
    sentry_sdk.init(
        dsn='___PUBLIC_DSN___',
        integrations=[CeleryIntegration()],
        environment="local.dev.grace",
        release="v1.0",
    )


@app.task
@sentry_sdk.monitor(monitor_slug='<monitor-slug>')  # ðŸ‘ˆ this is the new line.
def tell_the_world(msg):
    print(msg)
```
