The [HTTPX](https://www.python-httpx.org/) integration instruments outgoing HTTP requests using either the sync or the async HTTPX clients.

Use this integration to create spans for outgoing requests and ensure traces are properly propagated to downstream services.

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI with the `httpx` extra.

```bash
pip install --upgrade 'sentry-sdk[httpx]'
```

## Configure

<SignInNote />

```python
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for performance monitoring.
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
)
```

The HTTPX integration is enabled automatically if you have the `httpx` package installed.

## Verify

```python
import httpx

def main():
    sentry_init(...)  # same as above
    with sentry_sdk.start_transaction(name="testing_sentry"):
        r1 = httpx.get("https://sentry.io/")
        r2 = httpx.post("http://httpbin.org/post")

main()
```

This will create a transaction called `testing_sentry` in the Performance section of [sentry.io](https://sentry.io), and create spans for the outgoing HTTP requests.

It takes a couple of moments for the data to appear in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).
