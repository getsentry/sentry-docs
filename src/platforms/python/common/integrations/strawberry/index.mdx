The Strawberry integration captures errors and operations from the
[Strawberry GraphQL library](https://strawberry.rocks/). These can then be viewed
in [Sentry](https://sentry.io).

## Install

To get started, install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI.

```bash
pip install --upgrade sentry-sdk
```

## Configure

Add `StrawberryIntegration()` to your `integrations` list:

<SignInNote />

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.strawberry import StrawberryIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for performance monitoring.
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
    integrations=[
        # XXX Make sure to set async_execution to True or False!
        StrawberryIntegration(async_execution=True),
    ],
)
```

## Verify

```python
import strawberry

# XXX
```

This will create a transaction called `testing_sentry` in the Issues section of [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

It takes a couple of moments for the data to appear in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

## Options

The Strawberry integration can capture request and response payload
for each GraphQL error that happens. Since these may contain sensitive data, the
SDK needs to be initialized with the
[send_default_pii](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/configuration/options/#send-default-pii) option set to `True`;
otherwise no request or response data will be attached.

```python
sentry_sdk.init(
    # same options as above
    send_default_pii=True,
)
```

## Supported Versions

- strawberry-graphql: 0.208+
