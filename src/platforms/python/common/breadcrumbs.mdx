Sentry will automatically record certain events, such as changes to the URL and XHR requests to provide context to an error.

You can manually add breadcrumbs on other events or disable breadcrumbs.

```python
from sentry_sdk import add_breadcrumb

add_breadcrumb(
    category='auth',
    message='Authenticated user %s' % user.email,
    level='info',
)
```
