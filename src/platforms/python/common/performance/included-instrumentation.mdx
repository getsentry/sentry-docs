description: "Learn what instrumentation is included to capture transactions."
---

Many integrations for popular frameworks automatically capture transactions. If you already have any of the following frameworks set up for Sentry error reporting, you will start to see traces immediately:

- All WSGI-based web frameworks (Django, Flask, Pyramid, Falcon, Bottle)
- Celery
- AIOHTTP web apps
- Redis Queue (RQ)

Spans are instrumented for the following operations within a transaction:

- Database queries that use SQLAlchemy or the Django ORM
- HTTP requests made with requests or the stdlib
- Spawned subprocesses
- Redis operations

If you want to automatically enable all relevant transactions, you can use this alternative configuration:

```python
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    _experiments={"auto_enabling_integrations": True}
)
```
