Many integrations for popular frameworks automatically capture transactions. If you already have any of the following frameworks set up for Sentry error reporting, you will start to see traces immediately:

- All WSGI-based web frameworks (Django, Flask, Pyramid, Falcon, Bottle)
- Celery
- AIOHTTP web apps
- Redis Queue (RQ)

Spans are instrumented for the following operations within a transaction:

- Database queries that use SQLAlchemy or the Django ORM
- HTTP requests made with requests or the stdlib
- Spawned subprocesses
- Redis operations

Spans are only created within an existing transaction. If you're not using any of the supported frameworks, you'll need to <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation/">create transactions manually</PlatformLink>.
