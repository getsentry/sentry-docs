### HTTP headers

By default the Sentry SDK does not send any HTTP headers.

You can turn on sending of HTTP headers by setting `send_default_pii=True` in the `sentry_sdk.init()` call.

When sending of HTTP is enabled we have a [Denylist](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/blob/master/sentry_sdk/integrations/_wsgi_common.py#L19-L26) to filter out headers that contain sensitive data.

### Cookies

By default the Sentry SDK does not send any Cookies.

You can turn on sending of HTTP headers by setting `send_default_pii=True` in the `sentry_sdk.init()` call.

We try to remove all cookies that contain sensitive information (like the Session ID and CSRF Token cookies in Django)

### Information about logged-in user<br/>

By default the Sentry SDK does not send any information about the logged-in user.

You can turn on sending information about the currently logged-in user (information like email address, user id, username) by setting `send_default_pii=True` in the `sentry_sdk.init()` call.

### Users' IP address

By default the Sentry SDK does not send the users IP address.

You can turn on sending the users IP address by setting `send_default_pii=True` in the `sentry_sdk.init()` call.

### Request URL

The full request URL of outgoing and incoming HTTP requests is always sent to Sentry.

### Request query string

The full request query string of outgoing and incoming HTTP requests is always sent to Sentry.

### Request body

Sending of the request body to sentry depends on a couple of things:

- The type of the request body: JSON and form bodies are sent, raw request bodies are always removed. Uploaded files in request bodies are never sent to Sentry.
- The size of the request body: There is the option ["request_bodies"](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/configuration/options/#request-bodies) that is by default set to `medium` meaning that larger request bodies are removed.
- You can set `request_bodies` to `"never"` to prevent bodies to be sent to Sentry alltogether.

### Local variables in stack trace

When sending unhandled errors and exceptions to sentry the names and values of local variables that where set when the error occured are sent to Sentry.

You can prevent local variables to be sent to Sentry by setting `include_local_variables=False` in the `sentry_sdk.init()` call.

(Turn off with ["with_locals"](/platforms/python/configuration/options/#with-locals) option.)

### Performance spans

### Template Content

(In case an error happens in a template, a few lines before and after the line of the error are sent.)

### SQL Queries
