By default, Sentry error events will not get trace context unless you configure the scope with the transaction, as illustrated in the example below.

<Note>

Node.js profiling is currently in alpha. Alpha features are still in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony. If you have any questions or feedback, please email us at [profiling@sentry.io](mailto:profiling@sentry.io). If you’re adopting Profiling in a high-throughput environment, we recommend testing prior to deployment to ensure that your service’s performance characteristics maintain expectations.

</Note>

```javascript
const Sentry = require("@sentry/node");
// Note: You MUST import @sentry/tracing package before @sentry/profiling-node
require("@sentry/tracing");
const {ProfilingIntegration} = require("@sentry/profiling-node");

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    // Add our Profilling integration
    new ProfilingIntegration(),
  ],
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  // Set sampling rate for profiling
  profilesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

const transaction = Sentry.startTransaction({
  op: "transaction",
  name: "My Transaction",
});

// Any code executed between startTransaction and transaction.finish
// will now be automatically profiled.

transaction.finish();
```


## How does it work?

Under the hood, sentry profiler leverages V8's [CpuProfiler](https://v8docs.nodesource.com/node-18.2/d2/d34/classv8_1_1_cpu_profiler.html) to collect stack samples. This means that sentry/profiling-node is written as a [native addon](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/addons.html) for Node and will not run in environments like Deno or Bun. Profiling enhances tracing by providing profiles for the individual transactions - this allows you to look at higher level performance information like transaction and span durations before diving deeper and looking at profiles.

## Runtime flags

Profiling package enables you to run the profiler in either eager or lazy [mode](https://v8docs.nodesource.com/node-18.2/d2/dc3/namespacev8.html#a874b4921ddee43bef58d8538e3149374). During our initial tests, we have seen that the default profiling mode (lazy) can cause calls to startProfiling to take a long time - sometimes in the range of couple hundred milliseconds. We found that this occurs when we are starting a profile when no other profiles are started. This is the benefit of lazy logging, it adds no overhead when no profiles are running.

If you find this behavior prohibitive for your use case, there is an environment flag that you can set which will cause the profiler to run in eager mode. Eager mode improves the performance of calls to startProfiling at the tradeoff of small constant CPU overhead.

```bash
// Run profiler in eager mode
SENTRY_PROFILER_LOGGING_MODE=eager node script.js
```

It is always advised that you have your own CPU resource monitoring in place as the actual resource use could be environment dependant.

If you have feedback or experience different behavior please open an issue on sentry/profiling-node repository.
