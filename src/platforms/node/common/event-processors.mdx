title: Event Processors
---

With `eventProcessors` you can hook into the process of enriching the event with additional data. You can add your own `eventProcessor` on the current scope. The difference between `beforeSend` and `eventProcessors` is that `eventProcessors` run on the scope level whereas `beforeSend` runs globally, no matter which scope you're in.
Also, `eventProcessors` optionally receive the hint (see: <PlatformLink to="/configuration/filtering/#using-hints">hints</PlatformLink>).

```javascript
// This will be set globally for every succeeding event send
Sentry.configureScope(function(scope) {
  scope.addEventProcessor(function(event, hint) {
    // Add anything to the event here
    // returning null will drop the event
    return event;
  });
});

// Using withScope, will only call the event processor for all "sends"
// that happen within withScope
Sentry.withScope(function(scope) {
  scope.addEventProcessor(function(event, hint) {
    // Add anything to the event here
    // returning null will drop the event
    return event;
  });
  Sentry.captureMessage("Test");
});
```
