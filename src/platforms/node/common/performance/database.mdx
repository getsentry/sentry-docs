title: Database integrations
---

Node.js integrations support tracking database queries as spans. Starting in version `6.4.0`, `@sentry/tracing` will auto-detect supported database drivers or ORMs being used in your project, and automatically enable the relevant integrations with default options - without needing additional code.

Supported packages and their integration name: 
- `pg` (Postgres)
- `mongodb` (Mongo)
- `mongoose` (Mongo)
- `mysql` (MySQL)

### Disabling Automatic Instrumentation

You can also (remove an automatically-enabled integration)[integrations](/platforms/node/configuration/integrations/#removing-an-integration), if needed.

### Manually Adding Integrations

If you need to add a specific database integration manually (for example, when using multiple client instances), you can import them from the `@sentry/tracing` package under the `Integrations` namespace.

For example, to add MongoDB instrumentation to a custom client:

```javascript
const Sentry = require("@sentry/node");
const Tracing = require("@sentry/tracing");
const mongodb = require("mongodb");

const client = new Sentry.NodeClient({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [new Tracing.Integrations.Mongo()],
});
```
