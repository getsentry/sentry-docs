By default, Sentry's Node.js SDK can automatically instrument HTTP calls.
In order for this to work, you have to create transactions which the HTTP calls will be added to as spans.

Read more about [Custom Instrumentation](./../custom-instrumentation/) to learn how to create transactions and add your own spans.

<Note>

If you're adopting Performance in a high-throughput environment, we recommend testing prior to deployment to ensure that your service's performance characteristics maintain expectations.

Note, that calling `Sentry.autoDiscoverNodePerformanceMonitoringIntegrations` will degrade startup performance of your app due to file I/O operations.
This is especially a concern in Serverless functions.
We recommend manually adding <PlatformLink to="/performance/database" >database integrations</PlatformLink> of your choice manually (see example below).

</Note>

```javascript
const Sentry = require("@sentry/node");

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    // enable HTTP calls tracing
    new Sentry.Integrations.Http({ tracing: true }),
    // Automatically instrument Node.js libraries and frameworks
    // (This function is slow because of file I/O, consider manually adding additional integrations instead)
    ...Sentry.autoDiscoverNodePerformanceMonitoringIntegrations(),
    // Or manually add integrations of your choice. For example:
    new Sentry.Integrations.Apollo(),
    new Sentry.Integrations.Postgres(),
  ],

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```
