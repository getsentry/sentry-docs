By default, Sentry error events will not get trace context unless you configure the scope with the transaction, as illustrated in the example below.

<Note>

If you’re adopting Performance in a high-throughput environment, we recommend testing prior to deployment to ensure that your service’s performance characteristics maintain expectations.

</Note>

```javascript
const Sentry = require("@sentry/node");
const Tracing = require("@sentry/tracing");
// Note: You MUST import the package for tracing to work

const http = require("http");

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    // enable HTTP calls tracing
    new Sentry.Integrations.Http({ tracing: true }),
  ],

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

const transaction = Sentry.startTransaction({
  op: "transaction",
  name: "My Transaction",
});

// Note that we set the transaction as the span on the scope.
// This step makes sure that if an error happens during the lifetime of the transaction
// the transaction context will be attached to the error event
Sentry.configureScope(scope => {
  scope.setSpan(transaction);
});

let request;

try {
  // this should generate an http span
  request = http.get("http://sentry.io", res => {
    console.log(`STATUS: ${res.statusCode}`);
    console.log(`HEADERS: ${JSON.stringify(res.headers)}`);
  });

  // this error event should have trace context
  foo();
} catch (err) {
  Sentry.captureException(err);
}

request.on("close", () => {
  transaction.finish();
});
```


### Retrieving a Transaction

In cases where you want to attach Spans to an already ongoing Transaction you can use `Sentry.getCurrentHub().getScope().getTransaction()`. This function will return a `Transaction` in case there is a running Transaction otherwise it returns `undefined`. If you are using our Express integration by default we attach the Transaction to the Scope. So you could do something like this:

```javascript
app.get("/success", function successHandler(req, res) {
  const transaction = Sentry.getCurrentHub()
    .getScope()
    .getTransaction();

  if (transaction) {
    let span = transaction.startChild({
      op: "encode",
      description: "parseAvatarImages",
    });
    // Do something
    span.finish();
  }
  res.status(200).end();
});
```
