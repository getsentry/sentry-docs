By default, Sentry's Node.js SDK can automatically instrument HTTP calls.
In order for this to work, you have to create transactions which the HTTP calls will be added to as spans.

Read more about [Custom Instrumentation](./../custom-instrumentation/) to learn how to create transactions and add your own spans.

<Note>

If you’re adopting Performance in a high-throughput environment, we recommend testing prior to deployment to ensure that your service’s performance characteristics maintain expectations.

</Note>

```javascript
const Sentry = require("@sentry/node");

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    // enable HTTP calls tracing
    new Sentry.Integrations.Http({ tracing: true }),
    // Automatically instrument Node.js libraries and frameworks
    ...Sentry.autoDiscoverNodePerformanceMonitoringIntegrations(),
  ],

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```
