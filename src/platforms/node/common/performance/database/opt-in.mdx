## Prisma ORM Integration _(Available from `7.0.0`)_

Sentry supports tracing [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/) fetchers with Prisma integration. This integration is an opt-in feature and requires that a `PrismaClient` instance is provided.

For example:

```javascript
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/node';
import * as Tracing from '@sentry/tracing';
import { randomBytes } from 'crypto';

const client = new PrismaClient();

Sentry.init({
  dsn: ___PUBLIC_DSN___,
  release: '1.0',
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  integrations: [new Tracing.Integrations.Prisma({ client })],
});
```
