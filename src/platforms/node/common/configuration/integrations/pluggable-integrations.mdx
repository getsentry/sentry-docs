Pluggable integrations are integrations that can be additionally enabled to provide specific features. They're documented so you can understand what they do and enable them, if needed.

## Install

To enable pluggable integrations, install the package `@sentry/integrations`.

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install --save @sentry/integrations
```

```bash {tabTitle:Yarn}
yarn add @sentry/integrations
```

## Configure

After installation, you can import the integration and provide a new instance with your config to the `integrations` option.

<SignInNote />

```javascript
import { CaptureConsole } from "@sentry/integrations";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [new CaptureConsole()],
});
```

## Core

### CaptureConsole

_Import name: `CaptureConsole`_

This integration captures all `Console API` calls and redirects them to Sentry using `captureMessage` call.
It then re-triggers to preserve default native behavior.

Available options:

```javascript
{
  levels: string[]; // an array of methods that should be captured, defaults to ['log', 'info', 'warn', 'error', 'debug', 'assert']
}
```

### Dedupe

_Import name: `Dedupe`_

This integration deduplicates certain events. It can be helpful if you're receiving many duplicate errors. Be aware that we will only compare stack traces and fingerprints.

### Debug

_Import name: `Debug`_

This integration allows you to inspect the contents of the processed event and `hint` object that will be passed to `beforeSend` or `beforeSendTransaction`. It will _always_ run as the last integration, no matter when it was registered.

Note that this is different than setting `debug: true` in your `Sentry.init` options, which will enable debug logging in the console.

Available options:

```javascript
{
  debugger: boolean; // trigger DevTools debugger instead of using console.log
  // stringify event before passing it to console.log
  stringify: boolean;
}
```

### ExtraErrorData

_Import name: `ExtraErrorData`_

This integration extracts all non-native attributes from the `error` object and attaches them to the event as the `extra` data.

Available options:

```javascript
{
  // limit of how deep the object serializer should go. Anything deeper than limit will
  // be replaced with standard Node.js REPL notation of [Object], [Array], [Function] or
  // a primitive value. Defaults to 3.
  depth: number;
}
```

### RewriteFrames

_Import name: `RewriteFrames`_

This integration allows you to apply a transformation to each frame of the stack trace. In the streamlined scenario, it can be used to change the name of the file frame it originates from, or it can be fed with an iterated function to apply any arbitrary transformation.

On Windows machines, you have to use Unix paths and skip the volume letter in the `root` option to make it work.
For example, `C:\\Program Files\\Apache\\www` won't work, however, `/Program Files/Apache/www` will.

## Node-specific

### Undici

_(New in version 7.46.0)_

_Import name: `Sentry.Integrations.Undici`_

Instruments outgoing HTTP requests made with [undici](https://github.com/nodejs/undici) and [Node 18's Node Fetch](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v18.x/docs/api/globals.html#fetch) by adding breadcrumbs and spans.

Supports Undici `v4.7.0` or higher and requires Node `v16.7.0` or higher. There have been [reported issues with Node.js `v19`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/7958) and the Undici integration so we recommend you use an [LTS version of Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/en/about/releases/) with this integration.

Available options:

```typescript
{
  /**
   * If breadcrumbs should be created for outgoing requests.
   * Defaults to true.
   */
  breadcrumbs?: boolean;
  /**
   * Function determining whether or not to create spans to track outgoing requests to the given URL.
   * By default, spans will be created for all outgoing requests.
   */
  shouldCreateSpanForRequest?: (url: string) => boolean;
}
```

To change what requests get the `sentry-trace` and `baggage` headers attached (for use in distributed tracing), use the top level `tracePropagationTargets` option.

```typescript
Sentry.init({
  tracePropagationTargets: ["my-site-url.com"],
});
```

## Frameworks

### tRPC Middleware

_(New in version 7.48.0)_

The Sentry tRPC middleware helps make sure your transactions related to RPCs are well-named.
Additionally, it can attach RPC input via the `attachRpcInput` option.

```typescript
import { initTRPC } from "@trpc/server";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/node";

const t = initTRPC.context().create();
const sentryMiddleware = t.middleware(
  Sentry.Handlers.trpcMiddleware({
    attachRpcInput: true,
  })
);

const sentrifiedProcedure = t.procedure.use(sentryMiddleware);
```
