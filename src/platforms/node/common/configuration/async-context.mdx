You can use the `runWithAsyncContext` method to isolate Sentry scope and breadcrumbs to a single request if you are using SDK v7.48.0 or higher. This is useful if you are finding that breadcrumbs and scope are leaking across requests.

```js
const Sentry = require("@sentry/node");

function requestHandlerMiddleware(req, res, next) {
  // Any breadcrumbs or tags added will be isolated to the request
  return Sentry.runWithAsyncContext(() => {
    return next(req, res);
  });
}
```

Under the hood, the SDK uses Node's [AsyncLocalStorage API](https://nodejs.org/api/async_context.html#class-asynclocalstorage) to perform the isolation.

On lower SDK versions you'll have to use [domains](https://nodejs.org/api/domain.html) to isolate Sentry scope and breadcrumbs to a single request.

```js
const domain = require("domain");

function myRequestHandler(req, res, next) {
  const localDomain = domain.create();
  return localDomain.bind(() => {
    return next(req, res);
  })();
}
```
