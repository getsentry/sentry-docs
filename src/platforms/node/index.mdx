On this page, we provide concise information to get you up and running with Sentry's Node SDK, automatically reporting errors and exceptions in your application.

**Note:** If you don't already have an account and Sentry project established, head over to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/signup/), then return to this page.

Take a look at our specific guides to get started.

<GuideGrid platform="node" />

## Install

Add `@sentry/node` as a dependency:

```bash {tabTitle:NPM}
$ npm install --save @sentry/node
```

```bash {tabTitle:Yarn}
$ yarn add @sentry/node
```

## Configure

```javascript {tabTitle:CommonJS}
const Sentry = require("@sentry/node");

Sentry.init({ dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___" });
```

```javascript {tabTitle:ESM}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/node";

Sentry.init({ dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___" });
```

## Verify Setup

Verify your setup by intentionally sending an error that breaks your application. For example, in JavaScript, calling an undefined function throws an exception:

```javascript
try {
  myUndefinedFunction();
} catch (e) {
  Sentry.captureException(e);
}
```

Resolve the created error by logging in to sentry.io, then opening your project. On the **Issue Details** page, scroll down to the Exception stack trace and view the error.

## Monitor Performance

Performance Monitoring helps you see everything from macro-level metrics to micro-level spans, and you’ll be able to cross-reference transactions with related issues, customize queries based on your personal needs, and substantially more.

To get started with performance monitoring with Node.js, first install these packages:

```bash
# Using yarn
$ yarn add @sentry/node @sentry/tracing

# Using npm
$ npm install @sentry/node @sentry/tracing
```

To send traces, set the `tracesSampleRate` to a nonzero value. The following configuration will capture 100% of all your transactions:

```javascript
const Sentry = require("@sentry/node");
// or use es6 import statements
// import * as Sentry from '@sentry/node';

// This is required since it patches functions on the hub
const Tracing = require("@sentry/tracing");
// or use es6 import statements
// import * as Tracing from '@sentry/tracing';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0, // Be sure to lower this in production
});
```

Performance data is transmitted using a new event type called "transactions", which you can learn about in [Distributed Tracing](/performance-monitoring/distributed-tracing/#traces-transactions-and-spans). **To capture transactions, you must install the performance package and configure your SDK to set the `tracesSampleRate` option to a nonzero value.** The example configuration above will transmit 100% of captured transactions. You will want to lower this value in production, otherwise you could burn through your quota quickly.

Learn more about capturing performance data with the SDK in the [documentation for monitoring performance with the Node SDK](./performance/)
