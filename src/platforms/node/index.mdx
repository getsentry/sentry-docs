On this page, we provide concise information to get you up and running with Sentry's Node SDK, automatically reporting errors and exceptions in your application.

<Note>

If you don't already have an account and Sentry project established, head over to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/signup/), then return to this page.

</Note>

Take a look at our specific guides to get started.

<GuideGrid platform="node" />

## Install

Add `@sentry/node` as a dependency:

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install --save @sentry/node
```

```bash {tabTitle:Yarn}
yarn add @sentry/node
```

## Configure

```javascript {tabTitle:CommonJS}
const Sentry = require("@sentry/node");

Sentry.init({ dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___" });
```

```javascript {tabTitle:ESM}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/node";

Sentry.init({ dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___" });
```

## Usage

```javascript
try {
  // ...
} catch (e) {
  Sentry.captureException(e);
}
```

## Monitor Performance

To get started with performance monitoring with Node.js, first install these packages:

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install --save @sentry/node @sentry/tracing
```

```bash {tabTitle:Yarn}
yarn add @sentry/node @sentry/tracing
```

To send traces, set the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> to a nonzero value. The following configuration will capture 100% of all your transactions:

```javascript {tabTitle:CommonJS}
const Sentry = require("@sentry/node");
const Tracing = require("@sentry/tracing");

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

```javascript {tabTitle:ESM}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/node";
import * as Tracing from "@sentry/tracing";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

Performance data is transmitted using a new event type called "transactions", which you can learn about in [Distributed Tracing](/product/performance/distributed-tracing/#traces-transactions-and-spans). **To capture transactions, you must install the performance package and configure your SDK to set the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> option to a nonzero value.** The example configuration above will transmit 100% of captured transactions. You will want to lower this value in production, otherwise you could burn through your quota quickly.

## Verify Setup

Verify your setup by intentionally sending a transaction manually to Sentry. Make sure your sampling rate is at `1.0` so that your transaction captured and sent to Sentry.

```javascript
const transaction = Sentry.startTransaction({
  op: "test",
  name: "My First Test Transaction",
});

setTimeout(() => {
  try {
    foo();
  } catch (e) {
    Sentry.captureException(e);
  } finally {
    transaction.finish();
  }
}, 99);
```
