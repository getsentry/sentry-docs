<Note>

Looking for instructions on how to add Sentry without modifying your code? [Check out these docs instead](/product/integrations/cloud-monitoring/aws-lambda/).

</Note>

Before you begin, note:

- The estimated time to configure the integration is 5 - 15 minutes.
- You need to have experience with AWS console and a basic understanding of Lambda.
- You'll need an AWS account and you have to create an [IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html).

_(New in version 5.26.0)_

Create a deployment package on your local machine and install the required dependencies in the deployment package. For more information, see [Building an AWS Lambda deployment package for Node.js](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/lambda-deployment-package-nodejs/).

Add `@sentry/serverless` as a dependency:

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install --save @sentry/serverless
```

```bash {tabTitle:Yarn}
yarn add @sentry/serverless
```

We also support [installing Sentry as a Container Image](/platforms/node/guides/aws-lambda/container-image/) and [installing Sentry in Lambda Layer](/platforms/node/guides/aws-lambda/layer/).

You can use the AWS Lambda integration for the Node like this:

```javascript {tabTitle:async}
const Sentry = require("@sentry/serverless");

Sentry.AWSLambda.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

exports.handler = Sentry.AWSLambda.wrapHandler(async (event, context) => {
  // Your handler code
});
```

```javascript {tabTitle:sync}
const Sentry = require("@sentry/serverless");

Sentry.AWSLambda.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

exports.handler = Sentry.AWSLambda.wrapHandler((event, context, callback) => {
  // Your handler code
});
```

<!-- TODO-ADD-VERIFICATION-EXAMPLE -->

## Enable Timeout Warning

Sentry reports timeout warning when the function is within 500ms of its execution time. You can turn off timeout warnings by setting `captureTimeoutWarning` to `false` in the handler options. To change timeout warning limit, assign a numeric value (in ms) to `timeoutWarningLimit`

```javascript {tabTitle:captureTimeoutWarning}
exports.handler = Sentry.AWSLambda.wrapHandler(yourHandler, {
  captureTimeoutWarning: false,
});
```

```javascript {tabTitle:timeoutWarning}
exports.handler = Sentry.AWSLambda.wrapHandler(yourHandler, {
  timeoutWarningLimit: 50,
});
```

## Capture Rejected Promises in `Promise.allSettled`

_(New in version 6.14.3)_

By default, Sentry captures errors raised by your handler.
However, your handler might return a `Promise.allSettled` result.
In this case, even if one of the messages has failed, Sentry won't capture any exception.

The `captureAllSettledReasons` (default: `false`) option captures all promise rejected results

```javascript {tabTitle:captureAllSettledReasons}
exports.handler = Sentry.AWSLambda.wrapHandler(
  () => {
    return Promise.allSettled([
      Promise.rejected(new Error("first")),
      Promise.rejected(new Error("second")),
    ]);
  },
  { captureAllSettledReasons: true }
);
// `first` and `second` errors are captured
```

## Behavior

With the AWS Lambda integration enabled, the Node SDK will:

- Automatically report all events from your Lambda Functions.
- Allows you to <PlatformLink to="/configuration/sampling/#configuring-the-transaction-sample-rate">modify the transaction sample rate</PlatformLink> using <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" />.
- Issue reports automatically include:
  - A link to the cloudwatch logs
  - Function details
  - sys.argv for the function
  - AWS Request ID
  - Function execution time
  - Function version
- Sentry holds the thread for up to 2 seconds to report errors. You can change flush time limit by defining a `flushTimeout` value in the handler options
