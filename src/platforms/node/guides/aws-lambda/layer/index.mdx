description: "Learn how to set up Sentry with a Layer"
---

An alternative way of installing Sentry is using a [Lambda Layer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html). This happens instead of adding `@sentry/serverless` with NPM and Yarn. Your can still import Sentry as usual:

```javascript
const Sentry = require("@sentry/serverless");
```

<Note>

This installation method will not work if you are using Webpack.

</Note>

Then add the Sentry Layer by navigating to your Lambda function. Select **Layers**, then **Add a Layer**.

Then go to the **Specify an ARN** tab as shown:

Then below, set the region and copy the ARN value shown below into the input.
