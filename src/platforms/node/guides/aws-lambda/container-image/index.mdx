You can also add Sentry to your [Container Image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/images-create.html). To import Sentry's Layer Image, add the following to your Dockerfile:

```{tabTitle: Dockerfile}
COPY --from=public.ecr.aws/sentry/sentry-node-serverless-sdk:<VERSION> /opt/ /opt
```

Replace `VERSION` with a specific version number (for example, 28). You can see a complete list of available versions in Sentry's [Amazon ECR repository](https://gallery.ecr.aws/sentry/sentry-node-serverless-sdk).

## Function Configuration {#function-configuration}

Set the following environment variables in AWS:
- Set `NODE_OPTIONS` to `-r @sentry/serverless/dist/awslambda-auto`
- Set `SENTRY_DSN` to your Sentry's DSN
- Set `SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE` to your preferred [sampling rate](/platforms/python/configuration/sampling/#sampling-transaction-events) for transactions

Alternatively, you can also set the environment variables in the Dockerfile:

```{tabTitle: Dockerfile}
ENV NODE_OPTIONS="-r @sentry/serverless/dist/awslambda-auto"
ENV SENTRY_DSN="___PUBLIC_DSN___"
ENV SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE="1.0"
```

<Note>

The values you set in AWS override the value in the Dockerfile if both are set.
