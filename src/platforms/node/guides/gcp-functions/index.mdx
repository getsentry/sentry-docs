Add `@sentry/node` as a dependency:

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install --save @sentry/node
```

```bash {tabTitle:Yarn}
yarn add @sentry/node
```

To set up Sentry error logging for a GCP Cloud Function:

```javascript
"use strict";

const Sentry = require("@sentry/node");

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
});

try {
  notExistFunction();
} catch (e) {
  Sentry.captureException(e);
  Sentry.flush(2000);
}

exports.cloud_handler = (event, context) => {
  return {
    status_code: "200",
    body: "Hello from GCP Cloud Function!",
  };
};
```

You can obtain the DSN using your Sentry account from your organization's _Settings > Projects > Client Keys (DSN)_ in the Sentry web UI.

Note: You need to call both `captureException` and `flush` for captured events to be successfully delivered to Sentry.

Check out Sentry's [GCP sample apps](https://github.com/getsentry/examples/tree/master/gcp-cloud-functions/node) for detailed examples. Refer to the [JavaScript docs](/platforms/javascript/) for more configuration options.
