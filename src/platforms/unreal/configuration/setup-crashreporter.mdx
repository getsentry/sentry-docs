Installation of a Sentry SDK is not required in order to capture the crashes of your
UE4 application or game. Sentry supports the _UE4 Crash Reporter_.

To integrate your UE4 game or application with Sentry, the following steps are required:

1. Include the _UE4 Crash Reporter_ to your game or application.
2. Include Debug information in the crash reports.
3. Add the Unreal Engine Endpoint to the relevant configuration file.
4. Upload your games symbols so Sentry can display function names and line numbers.
5. Optionally enable Event Attachments for your Sentry project.

Below we'll break down each step in detail.

## UE4 Crash reporter

The UE4 Crash Reporter is provided out of the box by Epic Games. It is able to collect relevant
information about the crash and send it to a service like Sentry to process.

Adding it to your game means that in case a crash happens, the following dialog is displayed
to the user:

### Include the UE4 Crash Reporter

You can add the _Crash Reporter Client_ to your game in your _Project Settings_.

The simplest way is to search the option: `Crash Reporter`:

![Include UE4 Crash Reporter](ue4-include-crash-reporter.png)

The option is located under _Project > Packaging_ menu, then select _show advanced_ followed by
checking the box for: `Include Crash Reporter`.

## Debug information

To get the most out of Sentry, crash reports are required to include debug information.
In order for Sentry to be able to process the crash report and translate
memory addresses to meaningful information like function names, module names
and line numbers, the crash itself must include debug information and also, [symbols need
to be uploaded to Sentry](#upload-debug-symbols).

### Include Debug Information

![Include Debug Files](ue4-include-debug-files.png)

The option is also located under _Project > Packaging_ menu, then select _show advanced_ followed by
checking the box for: `Include Debug Files`.

## Configure the Crash Reporter Endpoint

Now that the _Crash Reporter_ and _Debug Files_ are included, UE4 needs to know where to send the
crash. For that, we add the Sentry _Unreal Engine Endpoint_ from the _Client Keys_ settings page to game's configuration file. This will
include which project within Sentry you want to see the crashes arriving in real time.
That's accomplished by configuring the `CrashReportClient` in the _DefaultEngine.ini_ file. Changing the engine is necessary for this to work.

Edit the file:

> engine-dir\Engine\Programs\CrashReportClient\Config\DefaultEngine.ini

Add the configuration section:

```ini {filename:DefaultEngine.ini}
[CrashReportClient]
CrashReportClientVersion=1.0
DataRouterUrl="___UNREAL_URL___"
```

<Alert level="info" title="Note">

If a `[CrashReportClient]` section already exists, simply changing the value of `DataRouterUrl`
is enough.

</Alert>

Alternatively, the endpoint can be added automatically to the _DefaultEngine.ini_ file
by using the Sentry configuration window.

Navigate to the editor's menu **Project Settings > Plugins > Sentry**, set the Sentry _Unreal Engine Endpoint_ in the corresponding input field, and click the **Update global settings** button to apply changes. The default endpoint value can be restored by clicking the **Reset** button once the _Crash Reporter_ is no longer needed.

## Configure the Crash Reporter Attributes {#configure-attributes}

Basic attributes can be reconfigured by providing special game data to the
crash reporter. Do this by setting the `__sentry` game data key to a JSON value containing
Sentry specific attributes:

```cpp
#include "GenericPlatform/GenericPlatformCrashContext.h"
#include "Dom/Json.h"

void ConfigureCrashReporter()
{
    TSharedPtr<FJsonObject> config = MakeShareable(new FJsonObject);

    // sentry specific attributes go here
    config->SetStringField("release", "my-project-name@2.3.12");
    config->SetStringField("environment", "production");

    TSharedPtr<FJsonObject> tags = MakeShareable(new FJsonObject);
    tags->SetStringField("tag1", "value1");
    tags->SetStringField("tag2", "value2");
    config->SetObjectField("tags", tags);

    TSharedPtr<FJsonObject> user = MakeShareable(new FJsonObject);
    user->SetStringField("ip_address", "{{auto}}");
    user->SetStringField("email", "jane.doe@example.com");
    config->SetObjectField("user", user);

    TSharedPtr<FJsonObject> character = MakeShareable(new FJsonObject);
    character->SetStringField("name", "Mighty Fighter");
    character->SetNumberField("age", 19.0);
    TSharedPtr<FJsonObject> contexts = MakeShareable(new FJsonObject);
    contexts->SetObjectField("character", character);
    config->SetObjectField("contexts", contexts);

    FString jsonConfig;
    TSharedRef<TJsonWriter<>> jsonWriter = TJsonWriterFactory<>::Create(&jsonConfig);
    FJsonSerializer::Serialize(config.ToSharedRef(), jsonWriter);

    FGenericCrashContext::SetGameData(TEXT("__sentry"), jsonConfig);
}
```

You need to call the `ConfigureCrashReporter` some time after your game
starts. Any [event attribute](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/event-payloads/) can be set.

Depending on the version of Unreal Engine you are using, you may have to
add JSON support to the build script (`MyProject.build.cs`):

```csharp
PublicDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] { ..., "Json" });
```

## Upload Debug Symbols {#upload-debug-symbols}

To allow Sentry to fully process native crashes and provide you with
symbolicated stack traces, you need to upload _Debug Information Files_
(sometimes also referred to as _Debug Symbols_ or just _Symbols_). We recommend
uploading debug information during your build or release process.

For all libraries where you'd like to receive symbolication, **you need
to provide debug information**. This includes dependencies and operating system
libraries.

In addition to Debug Information Files, Sentry needs _Call Frame Information_
(CFI) to extract accurate stack traces from minidumps of optimized release
builds. CFI is usually part of the executables and not copied to debug symbols.
Unless you are uploading Breakpad symbols, be sure to also include the binaries
when uploading files to Sentry.

For more information on uploading debug information and their supported formats,
see [Debug Information Files](/workflow/debug-files/).

## Size Limits

Event ingestion imposes limits on the size of UE4 crash reports. These limits
are subject to future change and defined currently as:

- _20MB_ for a compressed request
- _100MB_ for the full crash report after decompression
