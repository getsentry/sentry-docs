## Capacitor 2 on iOS

Capacitor 3 has a minimum requirement of iOS 12.0. As a result, the Sentry SDK needs to match this requirement to support Capacitor 3. Users on older versions may run into an error similar to:

> Specs satisfying the SentryCapacitor (from ../../node_modules/@sentry/capacitor) dependency were found, but they required a higher minimum deployment target.

You can fix this by bumping your iOS deployment target. Add the snippet below to your `capacitor.config.json`:

```json
// capacitor.config.json
{
  "ios": {
    "minVersion": "12.0"
  }
}
```

Then update your iOS settings:

```bash
npx cap sync
```

## Capacitor on Android

### No events sent

Check if you added `SentryCapacitor` to the bridge. This step is required for Capacitor 2 and optional on Capacitor 3. (It's only required if you are initializing other plugins using the old method. If so, we recommend you use `registerPlugin` instead of the deprecated code for initializing plugins.)

```java
import io.sentry.capacitor.SentryCapacitor;

public class MainActivity extends BridgeActivity {
  @Override
  public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

    // Capacitor 3
    registerPlugin(SentryCapacitor.class);

    // Capacitor 2
    this.init(savedInstanceState, new ArrayList<Class<? extends Plugin>>() {{
      add(SentryCapacitor.class);
    }});
  }
}
```

## Capacitor on iOS

### Capacitor sync failing

If you encounter the following error:
```
CocoaPods could not find compatible versions for pod "Sentry"
```

You can fix this by udating your pod repository:

```bash
pod repo update
```
