## Using with Capacitor 2 on iOS

Because Capacitor 3 has a minimum requirement of iOS 12.0, the Sentry SDK needs to match this requirement to support Capacitor 3. Sadly, users on older versions my run into an error such as

> Specs satisfying the SentryCapacitor (from ../../node_modules/@sentry/capacitor) dependency were found, but they required a higher minimum deployment target.

You can fix this by bumping your iOS deployment target up. Add the below snippet to your `capacitor.config.json`:

```json
// capacitor.config.json
{
  "ios": {
    "minVersion": "12.0"
  }
}
```

You can then update your iOS settings by running

```bash
npx cap sync
```
