## Capacitor 2 on iOS

Capacitor 3 has a minimum requirement of iOS 12.0. As a result, the Sentry SDK needs to match this requirement to support Capacitor 3. Users on older versions may run into an error similar to:

> Specs satisfying the SentryCapacitor (from ../../node_modules/@sentry/capacitor) dependency were found, but they required a higher minimum deployment target.

You can fix this by bumping your iOS deployment target. Add the snippet below to your `capacitor.config.json`:

```json
// capacitor.config.json
{
  "ios": {
    "minVersion": "12.0"
  }
}
```

Then update your iOS settings:

```bash
npx cap sync
```
