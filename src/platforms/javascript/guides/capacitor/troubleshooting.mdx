### Different versions for Sibling SDKs 

Sentry Capacitor requires your app to use the same versions of @Sentry/Angular (or another Sibling SDK) that is refered by the peer dependency of Sentry Capacitor, to avoid any issues when installing packages or using the code on another machine, it's recommended to use the exact version of both sentry/capacitor and the sibling SDK. 

Correct

```xml
    "@sentry/angular": "7.13.0",
    "@sentry/capacitor": "0.10.1"
```

Incorrect

```xml
    "@sentry/angular": "^7.13.0",
    "@sentry/capacitor": "^0.10.1"
```

One side effect of mismatching the SDKs is the follwing error during build time:

```js
node_modules/@sentry/types/types/globals.d.ts:2:11 - error TS2451: Cannot redeclare block-scoped variable '__DEBUG_BUILD__'.
```

To solve this you must use the exact version of the Sibling SDK.

<Note>

You can verify the correct version of the sibling SDK using the following command: `npm info @sentry/capacitor peerDependencies`

## Capacitor 2 on iOS

Capacitor 3 has a minimum requirement of iOS 12.0. As a result, the Sentry SDK needs to match this requirement to support Capacitor 3. Users on older versions may run into an error similar to:

> Specs satisfying the SentryCapacitor (from ../../node_modules/@sentry/capacitor) dependency were found, but they required a higher minimum deployment target.

You can fix this by bumping your iOS deployment target. Add the snippet below to your `capacitor.config.json`:

```json
// capacitor.config.json
{
  "ios": {
    "minVersion": "12.0"
  }
}
```

Then update your iOS settings:

```bash
npx cap sync
```

## Capacitor on Android

### No events sent

Check if you added `SentryCapacitor` to the bridge. This step is required for Capacitor 2 and optional on Capacitor 3. (It's only required if you are initializing other plugins using the old method. If so, we recommend you use `registerPlugin` instead of the deprecated code for initializing plugins.)

```java
import io.sentry.capacitor.SentryCapacitor;

public class MainActivity extends BridgeActivity {
  @Override
  public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

    // Capacitor 3
    registerPlugin(SentryCapacitor.class);

    // Capacitor 2
    this.init(savedInstanceState, new ArrayList<Class<? extends Plugin>>() {{
      add(SentryCapacitor.class);
    }});
  }
}
```

## Capacitor on iOS

### Capacitor sync failing

If you encounter the following error:
```
CocoaPods could not find compatible versions for pod "Sentry"
```

You can fix this by udating your pod repository:

```bash
pod repo update
```
