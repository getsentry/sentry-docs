Captures breadcrumbs and tracing spans for Electron's `net` module.  Breadcrumbs and tracing spans are enabled by default, while `sentry-trace` headers are added to requests for all origins.

The integration can be configured via constructor options:

```typescript
interface NetOptions {
  /**
   * Whether breadcrumbs should be captured for net requests
   *
   * Defaults to: true
   */
  breadcrumbs: boolean;
  /**
   * Whether to capture transaction spans for net requests
   *
   * Defaults to: true
   */
  tracing: boolean | (method: string, url: string) => boolean;
  /**
   * Whether to add 'sentry-trace' headers to outgoing requests
   *
   * Defaults to: true
   */
  tracingOrigins: boolean | (method: string, url: string) => boolean;
}
```

Here's a code example of how to disable breadcrumb capture and add `sentry-trace` headers to only capture spans for `POST` requests:

<SignInNote />

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/electron";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    Sentry.Integrations.Net({
      breadcrumbs: false,
      tracing: (method) => method == "POST",
      tracingOrigins: false,
    }),
  ],
});
```
