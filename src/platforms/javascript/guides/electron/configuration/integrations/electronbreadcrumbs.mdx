Captures breadcrumbs for events for many of Electrons built-in modules. The breadcrumbs captured for each module can be configured `true` to capture all events or `false` to capture no events. Alternatively you can supply a function which is passed the event name and returns `true` or `false` depending on whether the event should be captured.

The defaults for this integration are effectively:

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/electron";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    Sentry.Integrations.ElectronBreadcrumbs({
      app: (name) => !name.startsWith("remote-"),
      autoUpdater: true,
      webContents: (name) =>
        ["dom-ready", "context-menu", "load-url", "destroyed"].includes(name),
      browserWindow: (name) =>
        [
          "closed",
          "close",
          "unresponsive",
          "responsive",
          "show",
          "blur",
          "focus",
          "hide",
          "maximize",
          "minimize",
          "restore",
          "enter-full-screen",
          "leave-full-screen",
        ].includes(name),
      screen: true,
      powerMonitor: true,
    }),
  ],
});
```
