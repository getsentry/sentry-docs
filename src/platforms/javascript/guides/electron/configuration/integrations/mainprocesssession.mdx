Captures sessions linked to the lifetime of the Electron main process. Capturing sessions makes it possible to show [release health](/product/releases/health/) statistics in Sentry.

Unless `autoSessionTracking` is set to `false`, this integration will be automatically added.

<SignInNote />

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/electron";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  autoSessionTracking: false,
});
```

The default behavior is to only send sessions on error or when the main process ends. To send sessions when the main process is created, enable the `sendOnCreate` option.

```
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/electron";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [new Sentry.Integrations.MainProcessSession({ sendOnCreate: true })]
});
```
