Captures breadcrumbs and events for child process exits and crashes.

```typescript
type ExitReason =
  | "clean-exit"
  | "abnormal-exit"
  | "killed"
  | "crashed"
  | "oom"
  | "launch-failed"
  | "integrity-failure";

interface ChildProcessOptions {
  /** Child process events that generate Sentry breadcrumbs */
  breadcrumbs: ExitReason[];
  /** Child process events that generate Sentry events */
  events: ExitReason[];
}
```

For example, to disable the capture of breadcrumbs and only capture events for Out-Of-Memory crashes:

<SignInNote />

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/electron";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    Sentry.Integrations.ChildProcess({
      breadcrumbs: [],
      capture: ["oom"],
    }),
  ],
});
```
