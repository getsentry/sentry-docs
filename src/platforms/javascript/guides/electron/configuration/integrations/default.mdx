The Sentry Electron SDK uses `@sentry/node` in the main process and `@sentry/browser` in the renderers.

A number of integrations are included by default that setup communication between Electrons multiple processes and include Electron specific context and breadcrumbs.

## Main Process

### `MainContext`

Adds app, operating system and runtime context to all events.

### `OnUncaughtException`

Supports capturing events from `uncaughtException` while retaining Electrons default behaviour of displaying an error dialog if there are no other listeners.

To disable Electrons default error dialog, simply add another listener:

```javascript
process.on("uncaughtException", () => {});
```

### `ElectronBreadcrumbs`

Captures breadcrumbs for events for many of Electrons built-in modules. The breadcrumbs captured for each module can be configured `true` to capture all events or `false` to capture no events. Alternatively you can supply a function which is passed the event name and returns `true` or `false` depending on whether the event should be captured.

The defaults for this integration are effectively:

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/electron";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    Sentry.Integrations.ElectronBreadcrumbs({
      app: name => !name.startsWith("remote-"),
      autoUpdater: true,
      webContents: name =>
        ["dom-ready", "context-menu", "load-url", "destroyed"].includes(name),
      browserWindow: name =>
        [
          "closed",
          "close",
          "unresponsive",
          "responsive",
          "show",
          "blur",
          "focus",
          "hide",
          "maximize",
          "minimize",
          "restore",
          "enter-full-screen",
          "leave-full-screen",
        ].includes(name),
      screen: true,
      powerMonitor: true,
    }),
  ],
});
```

### `SentryMinidump`

Captures minidumps and sends them with full context to the Sentry Envelope endpoint using a custom uploader.

### `PreloadInjection`

Injects a preload script via the Electron [`session.setPreloads(preloads)`](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/session#sessetpreloadspreloads) API. By default sessions are only injected into the `defaultSession`. If you are using other sessions, you can pass a function as `getSessions` to `init`.

```javascript
import { session } from "electron";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/electron";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  getSessions: () => [
    session.defaultSession,
    session.fromPartition("persist:my-session"),
  ],
});
```

### `AdditionalContext`

Adds additional device context to events.

The constructor takes a number of options which all default to `true`:

```typescript
interface AdditionalContextOptions {
  cpu: boolean;
  screen: boolean;
  memory: boolean;
  language: boolean;
}
```

To disable specific context items, set them as `false`:

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/electron";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    Sentry.Integrations.AdditionalContext({
      screen: false,
    }),
  ],
});
```

### `Net`

Captures breadcrumbs and tracing spans for Electrons `net` module. By default breadcrumbs and tracing spans are enabled and `sentry-trace` headers are added to requests for all origins.

The integration can be configured via constructor options:

```typescript
interface NetOptions {
  /**
   * Whether breadcrumbs should be captured for net requests
   *
   * Defaults to: true
   */
  breadcrumbs: boolean;
  /**
   * Whether to capture transaction spans for net requests
   *
   * Defaults to: true
   */
  tracing: boolean | (method: string, url: string) => boolean;
  /**
   * Whether to add 'sentry-trace' headers to outgoing requests
   *
   * Defaults to: true
   */
  tracingOrigins: boolean | (method: string, url: string) => boolean;
}
```

For example, to disable breadcrumb capture and addition of `sentry-trace` headers and only capture spans for `POST` requests:

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/electron";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    Sentry.Integrations.Net({
      breadcrumbs: false,
      tracing: method => method == "POST",
      tracingOrigins: false,
    }),
  ],
});
```

### `ChildProcess`

Captures breadcrumbs and events for child process exits and crashes.

```typescript
type ExitReason =
  | "clean-exit"
  | "abnormal-exit"
  | "killed"
  | "crashed"
  | "oom"
  | "launch-failed"
  | "integrity-failure";

interface ChildProcessOptions {
  /** Child process events that generate Sentry breadcrumbs */
  breadcrumbs: ExitReason[];
  /** Child process events that generate Sentry events */
  events: ExitReason[];
}
```

For example, to disable capture of breadcrumbs and only capture events for Out-Of-Memory crashes:

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/electron";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    Sentry.Integrations.ChildProcess({
      breadcrumbs: [],
      capture: ["oom"],
    }),
  ],
});
```

### `MainProcessSession`

Captures sessions linked to the lifetime of the Electron main process. These sessions result in [release health](/product/releases/health/) statistics being displayed in Sentry.

Unless `autoSessionTracking` is set to `false`, this integration will be automatically added.

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/electron";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  autoSessionTracking: false,
});
```

## Renderer Process

### `ScopeToMain`

Captures scope updates and breadcrumbs in renderer processes and forwards them to the Electron main process.

### `EventToMain`

Captures events in the renderer processes and forwards them to the Electron main process. This integration prevents events from being sent by the underlying `@sentry/browser` SDK.
