On this page, we provide concise information to use Sentry with your Angular application. You will need to use `@sentry/angular` (Sentry’s Browser Angular SDK).

**Note:** If you don't already have an account and Sentry project established, head over to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/signup/), then return to this page.

## Install

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your application’s runtime. Add the Sentry SDK as a dependency using `yarn` or `npm`:

```bash
# Using yarn
$ yarn add @sentry/angular

# Using npm
$ npm install @sentry/angular
```

## Configure

`init` the Sentry browser SDK as soon as possible during your application load up, before initializing Angular:

```javascript
import { enableProdMode } from "@angular/core";
import { platformBrowserDynamic } from "@angular/platform-browser-dynamic";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/angular";

import { AppModule } from "./app/app.module";

Sentry.init({ dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___" });

enableProdMode();
platformBrowserDynamic()
  .bootstrapModule(AppModule)
  .then(success => console.log(`Bootstrap success`))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```

Once this is done, all uncaught exceptions are automatically reported to Sentry. Additionally, you can configure `@sentry/angular` to catch any Angular-specific exceptions reported through the [@angular/core/ErrorHandler](https://angular.io/api/core/ErrorHandler) provider.

**Important:** Note your DSN. The _DSN_ (Data Source Name) tells the SDK where to send events. If you forget it, view _Settings -> Projects -> Client Keys (DSN)_ in the Sentry web UI.

### Automatically Send Errors with `ErrorHandler`

`@sentry/angular` exports a function to instantiate an `ErrorHandler` provider that will automatically send Javascript errors captured by the Angular's error handler.

```javascript
import { NgModule, ErrorHandler } from "@angular/core";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/angular";

@NgModule({
  // ...
  providers: [
    {
      provide: ErrorHandler,
      useValue: Sentry.createErrorHandler({
        showDialog: true,
      }),
    },
  ],
  // ...
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Additionally, `createErrorHandler` accepts a set of options that allows you to configure its behavior. For more details see the `ErrorHandlerOptions` interface in [our repository](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/master/packages/angular/src/errorhandler.ts).

## Monitor Performance

`@sentry/angular` exports a Trace Service, Directive, and Decorators that leverages the `@sentry/tracing`, Sentry's Tracing integration, to add Angular-related spans to transactions. The service itself tracks route changes and durations, where directive and decorators are tracking component initializations.

**Note:** If the Tracing integration is not enabled, this functionality will not work.

### Install

Install a Trace Service with these three steps:

1. Register and configure the Tracing integration, including custom Angular routing instrumentation:

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/angular";
import { Integrations } from "@sentry/tracing";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    new Integrations.BrowserTracing({
      tracingOrigins: ["localhost", "https://yourserver.io/api"],
      routingInstrumentation: Sentry.routingInstrumentation,
    }),
  ],
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0, // Be sure to lower this in production
});
```

2. Register `TraceService` as a provider in Angular's DI system, with a `Router` as its dependency:

```javascript
import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";
import { Router } from "@angular/router";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/angular";

@NgModule({
  // ...
  providers: [
    {
      provide: Sentry.TraceService,
      deps: [Router],
    },
  ],
  // ...
})
export class AppModule {}
```

3. Either require the `TraceService` from inside `AppModule` or use `APP_INITIALIZER` to force instantiate Tracing.

```javascript
@NgModule({
  // ...
})
export class AppModule {
  constructor(trace: TraceService) {}
}
```

or

```javascript
import { APP_INITIALIZER } from "@angular/core";

@NgModule({
  // ...
  providers: [
    {
      provide: APP_INITIALIZER,
      useFactory: () => () => {},
      deps: [TraceService],
      multi: true,
    },
  ],
  // ...
})
export class AppModule {}
```
