Sentry's React SDK offers a feature to monitor the performance of your React components: component tracking. The SDK exports a `withProfiler` higher-order component that attaches React related spans to the current active transaction on the scope. This allows you to get a drilled-down view into how your components are behaving so you can do things like identify slow mounts or frequent updates, which might have an impact on your app's performance.

<Alert>

To set up component tracking, you need to configure performance monitoring. For details on how to do this, check out our [Performance documentation](/platforms/javascript/guides/react/performance/).

In the example below, the `withProfiler` higher-order component is used to instrument an app component.

```javascript
import React from "react";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <FancyComponent>
        <NestedComponent someProp={2} />
        <AnotherComponent />
      </FancyComponent>
    );
  }
}

export default Sentry.withProfiler(App);
```

The React Profiler currently generates spans with three different kinds of op-codes: `ui.react.mount`, `ui.react.render`, and `ui.react.update`.

`ui.react.mount`

: The span that represents how long it took for the profiled component to mount.

`ui.react.render`

: The span that represents how long the profiled component was on a page. This span is only generated if the profiled component mounts and unmounts while a transaction is occurring.

`ui.react.update`

: The span that represents when the profiled component updated. This span is only generated if the profiled component has mounted.

<Alert>

In [React Strict Mode](https://reactjs.org/docs/strict-mode.html), certain component methods will be [invoked twice](https://reactjs.org/docs/strict-mode.html#detecting-unexpected-side-effects). This may lead to duplicate `ui.react.mount` spans appearing in a transaction. React Strict Mode only runs in development mode, so this will have no impact on your production traces.

</Alert>

## Profiler Options

The `withProfiler` higher-order component has a variety of options for further customization. They can be passed in as the second argument to the `withProfiler` function.

```javascript
export default Sentry.withProfiler(App, { name: "CustomAppName" });
```

`name` (string)

: The name of the component being profiled. By default, the name is taken from the component `displayName` property or the component `name` property.

`includeRender` (boolean)

: If a `ui.react.render` span should be created by the Profiler. Set as true by default.

`includeUpdates` (boolean)

: If `react.update` spans should be created by the Profiler. Set as true by default. We recommend setting this prop as false for components that will experience many rerenders, such as text input components, as the resulting spans can be very noisy.
