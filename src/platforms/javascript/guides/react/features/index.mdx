The Sentry React SDK offers React-specific features for first class integration with the framework.

- **[Error Boundaries](./errorboundary/)**

- **[Component Tracking](./componenttracking/)**

  Use the Sentry Profiler component to generate React component spans that will get attached to the active transaction.
