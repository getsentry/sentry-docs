title: React Error Boundary
excerpt: ""
---

The React SDK exports an error boundary component that leverages [React component APIs](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html) to automatically catch and send JavaScript errors from inside a React component tree to Sentry.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";

<Sentry.ErrorBoundary fallback={"An error has occurred"}>
  <Example />
</Sentry.ErrorBoundary>;
```

The Sentry Error Boundary is also available as a higher order component.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";

Sentry.withErrorBoundary(Example, { fallback: "an error has occurred" });
```

<Alert level="warning" title="Note">

In development mode, React will rethrow errors caught within an error boundary. This will result in errors being reported twice to Sentry with the above setup, but this wonâ€™t occur in your production build.

</Alert>

In the example below, when the `<Example />` component hits an error, the `<Sentry.ErrorBoundary>` component will send data about that error and the component tree to Sentry, open a user feedback dialog, and render a fallback UI.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";

import { Example } from "../example";

function FallbackComponent() {
  return <div>An error has occurred</div>;
}

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Sentry.ErrorBoundary fallback={FallbackComponent} showDialog>
        <Example />
      </Sentry.ErrorBoundary>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

## Options

The ErrorBoundary component exposes a variety of props that can be passed in for extra configuration. There are no required options, but we highly recommend that you set a fallback component.

`showDialog` (boolean)

: If a [Sentry User Feedback Widget](../../enriching-events/user-feedback/) should be rendered when the Error Boundary catches an error.

`dialogOptions` (Object)

: Options that are passed into the Sentry User Feedback Widget. See all possible customization options [here](../../enriching-events/user-feedback/#customizing-the-widget).

`fallback` (React.ReactNode or Function)

: A fallback component that gets rendered when the error boundary encounters an error. You can can either provide a React Component, or a function that returns a React Component as a valid fallback prop. If you provide a function, Sentry will call the function with the error and the component stack at the time of the error.

`onError` (Function)

: A function that gets called when the Error Boundary encounters an error. `onError` is useful if you want to propagate the error into a state management library like Redux, or if you want to check any side effects that could have occurred due to the error.

`onMount` (Function)

: A function that gets called on ErrorBoundary `componentDidMount()`.

`onUnmount` (Function)

: A function that gets called on ErrorBoundary `componentWillUnmount()`.

`onUnmount` (Function)

: A function that gets called on ErrorBoundary `componentWillUnmount()`.

`beforeCapture` (Function)

_(New in version 5.20.0)_

: A function that gets called before an error is sent to Sentry, allowing for extra tags or context to be added to the error.

## Examples

#### Setting a Fallback Function (Render Props)

Below is an example where a fallback prop, using the [render props approach](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html), is used to display a fallback UI on error, and gracefully return to a standard component state when reset.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";

class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      message: "This is my app",
    };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <Sentry.ErrorBoundary
        fallback={({ error, componentStack, resetError }) => (
          <React.Fragment>
            <div>You have encountered an error</div>
            <div>{error.toString()}</div>
            <div>{componentStack}</div>
            <button
              onClick={() => {
                this.setState({ message: "This is my app" });
                resetError();
              }}
            >
              Click here to reset!
            </button>
          </React.Fragment>
        )}
      >
        <div>{this.state.message}</div>
        {/* on click, this button sets an Object as a message, not a string. */}
        {/* which will cause an error to occur in the component tree */}
        <button
          onClick={() => this.setState({ message: { text: "Hello World" } })}
        >
          Click here to change message!
        </button>
      </Sentry.ErrorBoundary>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

#### Using multiple error boundaries

_(New in version 5.20.0)_

When using multiple error boundaries, we recommend using `beforeCapture` to set tags/context so that you can tell which error boundary the error occurred from. In the example below, we attach tags to errors based on what route they rendered in.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react';

function App({ props }) {
  return (
    <ErrorBoundary
        beforeCapture={(scope) => {
          scope.setTag("location", "first");
          scope.setTag("anotherTag", "anotherValue");
        }}
      >
        <Route to="path/to/first" component={First} />
      </ErrorBoundary>
      <ErrorBoundary
        beforeCapture={(scope) => {
          scope.setTag("location", "second");
        }}
      >
        <Route to="path/to/second" component={Second} />
      </ErrorBoundary>
  )
}

export default App;
```
