The Sentry React SDK exposes custom components for first class integration with the React framework.

- **[Error Boundaries](./errorboundary/)**

  Use the Sentry Error Boundary component to automatically send JavaScript errors from inside a React component tree to Sentry

- **[Profiler](./profiler/)**

  Use the Sentry Profiler component to generate React component spans that will get attached to the active transaction.
