_(Available in version 5.21.0 and above)_

React Router support is included in the `@sentry/react` package since version `5.21.0`.

<Alert level="info" title="Note">

The React Router integration is designed to work with our Tracing SDK, `@sentry/tracing`. Please see [Getting Started with React Performance](/product/performance/getting-started/?platform=react) for more details on how to set up and install the SDK.

</Alert>

We support integrations for React Router 3, 4, 5, and 6.

## React Router v6
_(Available in version 7 and above)_

To use React Router v6 with Sentry:

1. Initialize `Sentry.reactRouterV6Instrumentation` as your routing instrumentation and provide the functions it needs to enable performance tracing:

    - `useEffect` hook from `react`
    - `useLocation` and `useNavigationType` hooks from `react-router-dom`
    - `createRoutesFromChildren` and `matchRoutes` functions from `react-router-dom` or `react-router` packages.
    
2. Wrap [`Routes`](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/api#routes-and-route) using `Sentry.withSentryReactRouterV6Routing` to create a higher order component, which will enable Sentry to reach your router context, as in the example below:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import {
    Routes,
    BrowserRouter,
    useLocation,
    useNavigationType,
    createRoutesFromChildren,
    matchRoutes,
} from "react-router-dom";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";
import { BrowserTracing } "@sentry/tracing";

Sentry.init({
    integrations: [
        new BrowserTracing({
            routingInstrumentation: Sentry.reactRouterV6Instrumentation(
                React.useEffect,
                useLocation,
                useNavigationType,
                createRoutesFromChildren,
                matchRoutes,
            ),
        }),
    ],
    tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

const SentryRoutes = Sentry.withSentryReactRouterV6Routing(Routes)

ReactDOM.render(
    <BrowserRouter>
        <SentryRoutes>
            <Route path="/" element={<div>Home</div>} />
        </SentryRoutes>
    </BrowserRouter>,
);
```

Now, Sentry should generate `pageload`/`navigation` transactions with parameterized transaction names (ex. /teams/:teamid/user/:userid), where applicable.


## React Router v4/v5

The React router instrumentation uses the React router library to create `pageload/navigation` transactions and paramaterize transaction names. Make sure you use a `Router` component combined with `createBrowserHistory` (or equivalent).

### Parameterized transaction names

To get parameterized transaction names (ex. `/teams/:teamid/user/:userid` instead of `/teams/123/user/345`), you must give the SDK access to the match path of the route render. This is as there is no static route config that the SDK can use in React Router v4/v5. There are two ways to accomplish this:

1. Pass a Route Config Object

You can pass an array of route config objects as per [react-router-config](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/master/packages/react-router-config). to the instrumentation function call. You will also need to provide the `matchPath` function exported from the `react-router-dom` or `react-router` packages.

```javascript
import { Route, Router, Switch, matchPath } from 'react-router-dom';
import { createBrowserHistory } from 'history';

import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react';
import { BrowserTracing } from '@sentry/tracing';

const history = createBrowserHistory();

// Array of Route Config Objects
// Make sure the order of the routes is correct. The longest url under the same parent should be placed first and in decreasing order.
const routes = [{ path: '/users/:userid' }, { path: '/users' }, { path: '/' }];

Sentry.init({
  integrations: [
    new BrowserTracing({
      routingInstrumentation: Sentry.reactRouterV5Instrumentation(history, routes, matchPath),
    }),
  ],

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

// In your App render:
render() {
  return (
    <Router history={history}>
      <Switch>
         <Route path="/users/:userid" component={() => <div>UserId</div>} />
         <Route path="/users" component={() => <div>Users</div>} />
         <Route path="/" component={() => <div>Home</div>} />
      </Switch>
    </Router>
  );
}
```

2. Use Sentry Route component

Use the `withSentryRouting` higher order component to create a `SentryRoute` component that will update the match path on render.

```javascript
import {Route, Router, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
import { createBrowserHistory } from 'history';

import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react';
import { BrowserTracing } from '@sentry/tracing';

// Create Custom Sentry Route component
const SentryRoute = Sentry.withSentryRouting(Route);

const history = createBrowserHistory();

Sentry.init({
  integrations: [
    new BrowserTracing({
      routingInstrumentation: Sentry.reactRouterV5Instrumentation(history),
    }),
  ],

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

render() {
  return (
    <Router history={history}>
      <Switch>
        <SentryRoute path="/users/:userid" component={() => <div>UserId</div>} />
        <SentryRoute path="/users" component={() => <div>Users</div>} />
        <SentryRoute path="/" component={() => <div>Home</div>} />
      </Switch>
    </Router>
  );
}
```

## React Router v3

To use the router integration, import and set a custom routing instrumentation and pass it the history, your routes and a match function. React Router v3 support is maintained for React Router >= 3.2.0 and < 4.0.0.

```javascript
import * as Router from "react-router";

import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";
import { BrowserTracing } from "@sentry/tracing";

// Routes looks like this:
const routes = (
  <Route path="/">
    <Route path="organizations/">
      <Route path=":orgid" component={() => <div>OrgId</div>} />
      <Route path=":orgid/v1/:teamid" component={() => <div>Team</div>} />
    </Route>
  </Route>
);

Sentry.init({
  integrations: [
    new BrowserTracing({
      routingInstrumentation: Sentry.reactRouterV3Instrumentation(
        Router.browserHistory,
        // Must be Plain Routes.
        Router.createRoutes(routes),
        Router.match
      ),
    }),
  ],

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```
