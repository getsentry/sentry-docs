To use Sentry with your Gatsby application, you will need to use `@sentry/gatsby` (Sentryâ€™s Gatsby SDK):

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install --save @sentry/gatsby
```

```bash {tabTitle:Yarn}
yarn add @sentry/gatsby
```

<Note>

`@sentry/gatsby` is a wrapper around the `@sentry/react` package, with added functionality related to Gatsby. All methods available in the `@sentry/react` package can also be imported from `@sentry/gatsby`.

</Note>

Register the `@sentry/gatsby` plugin in your Gatsby configuration file (typically `gatsby-config.js`).

```javascript {filename:gatsby-config.js}
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: "@sentry/gatsby",
    },
  ],
};
```

Then, configure your `Sentry.init`:

```javascript {filename:sentry.config.js}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/gatsby";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for performance monitoring.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

```typescript {filename:sentry.config.ts}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/gatsby";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for performance monitoring.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```
