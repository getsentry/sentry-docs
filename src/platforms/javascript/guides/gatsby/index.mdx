To use Sentry with your Gatsby application, you will need to use `@sentry/gatsby` (Sentryâ€™s Gatsby SDK):

```bash {tabTitle:NPM}
npm install --save @sentry/gatsby
```

```bash {tabTitle:Yarn}
yarn add @sentry/gatsby
```

<Note>

`@sentry/gatsby` is a wrapper around the `@sentry/react` package, with added functionality related to Gatsby. All methods available in the `@sentry/react` package can also be imported from `@sentry/gatsby`.

</Note>

## Connecting the SDK to Sentry

You can configure the SDK in one of two ways discussed below: by creating a configuration file, or defining the options along with the Gatsby configuration. If you define options in both places, the SDK will prioritize the `init` in the configuration file and ignore the options in the Gatsby configuration.

### Sentry Configuration File

<Note>

The minimum version supporting the Sentry configuration file is `6.14.0`.

</Note>

Using a Sentry configuration file is the approach we recommend since it supports defining non-serializable options in the `init`. Note that you still need to include the plugin, even if you don't set any options.

```javascript {filename:gatsby-config.js}
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: "@sentry/gatsby",
    },
  ],
};
```

Configure your `Sentry.init`:

```javascript {filename:sentry.config.js}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/gatsby";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0, // Adjust this value in production
  beforeSend(event) {
    // Modify the event here
    if (event.user) {
      // Don't send user's email address
      delete event.user.email;
    }
    return event;
  },
  // ...
});
```

```typescript {filename:sentry.config.ts}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/gatsby";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0, // Adjust this value in production
  beforeSend(event) {
    // Modify the event here
    if (event.user) {
      // Don't send user's email address
      delete event.user.email;
    }
    return event;
  },
  // ...
});
```

### Gatsby Plugin Configuration

Another alternative is to use Gatsby's [plugin configuration options](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/plugins-and-themes/using-a-plugin-in-your-site/#using-plugin-configuration-options). While this keeps the SDK options with the plugin definition, it doesn't support non-serializable options like `integrations`, `transport`, `stackParser`,`beforeSend`, and `tracesSampler`.

```javascript {filename:gatsby-config.js}
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: "@sentry/gatsby",
      options: {
        dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
        tracesSampleRate: 1.0, // Adjust this value in production
        // Cannot set any non-serializable options
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

With this approach, the SDK sets some options automatically based on environmental variables, but these can be overridden by setting custom options.

`environment` (string)

: Defaults to `process.env.NODE_ENV` or `development`

`release` (string)

: Defaults to certain environment variables based on the platform

- GitHub Actions: `process.env.GITHUB_SHA`
- Netlify: `process.env.COMMIT_REF`
- Vercel: `process.env.VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA`
