To use Sentry with your Gatsby application, you will need to use `@sentry/gatsby` (Sentryâ€™s Gatsby SDK):

```bash {tabTitle:NPM}
npm install --save @sentry/gatsby
```

```bash {tabTitle:Yarn}
yarn add @sentry/gatsby
```

<Note>

`@sentry/gatsby` is a wrapper around the `@sentry/react` package, with added functionality related to Gatsby. All methods available in the `@sentry/react` package can also be imported from `@sentry/gatsby`.

</Note>

First add `@sentry/gatsby` as a plugin to your `gatsby-config.js`.

```javascript {filename:gatsby-config.js}
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: "@sentry/gatsby",
    },
  ],
};
```

Then, configure your `Sentry.init`:

```javascript {filename:sentry.config.js}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/gatsby";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0, // Adjust this value in production
  beforeSend(event) {
    // Modify the event here
    if (event.user) {
      // Don't send user's email address
      delete event.user.email;
    }
    return event;
  },
  // ...
});
```

```typescript {filename:sentry.config.ts}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/gatsby";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0, // Adjust this value in production
  beforeSend(event) {
    // Modify the event here
    if (event.user) {
      // Don't send user's email address
      delete event.user.email;
    }
    return event;
  },
  // ...
});
```
