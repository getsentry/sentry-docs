To use Sentry with your Vue application, you will need to use Sentry’s browser JavaScript SDK: `@sentry/browser`.

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install --save  @sentry/browser @sentry/integrations
```

```bash {tabTitle:Yarn}
yarn add  @sentry/browser @sentry/integrations
```

On its own, `@sentry/browser` will report any uncaught exceptions triggered by your application.

Additionally, the Vue _integration_ will capture the name and props state of the active component where the error was thrown. This is reported via Vue’s `config.errorHandler` hook.

Then add this to your `app.js`:

```javascript
import Vue from "vue";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";
import { Vue as VueIntegration } from "@sentry/integrations";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [new VueIntegration({ Vue, attachProps: true })],
});
```

Additionally, `Integrations.Vue` accepts a few different configuration options that let you change its behavior:

- Passing in `Vue` is optional, if you do not pass it `window.Vue` must be present.
- Passing in `attachProps` is optional and is `true` if it is not provided. If you set it to `false`, Sentry will suppress sending all Vue components' props for logging.
- Passing in `logErrors` is optional and is `false` if it is not provided. If you set it to `true`, Sentry will call original Vue's `logError` function as well.

Please note that if you enable this integration, Vue will not call its `logError` internally. This means that errors occurring in the Vue renderer will not show up in the developer console.
If you want to preserve this functionality, make sure to pass the `logErrors: true` option.

In case you are using the CDN version or the Loader, we provide a standalone file for every integration, you can use it
like this:

```html
<!-- Note that we now also provide a es6 build only -->
<!-- <script src="https://browser.sentry-cdn.com/{{ packages.version('sentry.javascript.browser') }}/bundle.es6.min.js" integrity="sha384-{{ packages.checksum('sentry.javascript.browser', 'bundle.es6.min.js', 'sha384-base64') }}" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> -->
<script
  src="https://browser.sentry-cdn.com/{{ packages.version('sentry.javascript.browser') }}/bundle.min.js"
  integrity="sha384-{{ packages.checksum('sentry.javascript.browser', 'bundle.min.js', 'sha384-base64') }}"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
></script>

<!-- If you include the integration it will be available under Sentry.Integrations.Vue -->
<script
  src="https://browser.sentry-cdn.com/{{ packages.version('sentry.javascript.browser') }}/vue.min.js"
  integrity="sha384-{{ packages.checksum('sentry.javascript.browser', 'vue.min.js', 'sha384-base64') }}"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
></script>

<script>
  Sentry.init({
    dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    integrations: [new Sentry.Integrations.Vue({ Vue, attachProps: true })],
  });
</script>
```

## Monitor Performance

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
$ npm install --save @sentry/browser @sentry/integrations @sentry/tracing
```

```bash {tabTitle:Yarn}
$ yarn add @sentry/browser @sentry/integrations @sentry/tracing
```

The most basic configuration for tracing your Vue app, which would track only the top-level component, looks like this:

```js
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";
import { Vue as VueIntegration } from "@sentry/integrations";
import { Integrations } from "@sentry/tracing";
import Vue from "vue";

Sentry.init({
  // ...
  integrations: [
    new Integrations.BrowserTracing(),
    new VueIntegration({
      Vue,
      tracing: true,
    }),
  ],

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

If you want to track child components, and see more details about the rendering process, configure the integration to track them all:

```js
new VueIntegration({
  Vue,
  tracing: true,
  tracingOptions: {
    trackComponents: true,
  },
});
```
