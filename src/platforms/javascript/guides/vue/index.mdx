To use Sentry with your Vue application, you will need to use Sentry’s Vue SDK: `@sentry/vue`.

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install --save  @sentry/vue
```

```bash {tabTitle:Yarn}
yarn add  @sentry/vue
```

On its own, `@sentry/vue` will report any uncaught exceptions triggered by your application.

Additionally, the SDK will capture the name and props state of the active component where the error was thrown. This is reported via Vue’s `config.errorHandler` hook.

Then add this to your `app.js`:

```javascript
import Vue from "vue";
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/vue';

Sentry.init({
  Vue: Vue,
  dsn: '__PUBLIC_DSN__',
});
```

Additionally the SDK accepts a few different configuration options that let you change its behavior:

- Passing in `Vue` is optional, if you do not pass it `window.Vue` must be present.
- Passing in `attachProps` is optional and is `true` if it is not provided. If you set it to `false`, Sentry will suppress sending all Vue components' props for logging.
- Passing in `logErrors` is optional and is `false` if it is not provided. If you set it to `true`, Sentry will call original Vue's `logError` function as well.

Please note that if you enable the SDK, Vue will not call its `logError` internally. This means that errors occurring in the Vue renderer will not show up in the developer console.
If you want to preserve this functionality, make sure to pass the `logErrors: true` option.

</Alert>

In case you are using the CDN version or the Loader, we provide a standalone file for every integration, you can use it	
like this:	

```html	
<script	
  src="https://browser.sentry-cdn.com/{{ packages.version('sentry.javascript.browser') }}/vue.min.js"	
  integrity="sha384-{{ packages.checksum('sentry.javascript.browser', 'vue.min.js', 'sha384-base64') }}"	
  crossorigin="anonymous"	
></script>	

<script>	
  Sentry.init({	
    Vue,
    dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",	
  });	
</script>	
```	

## Monitor Performance

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install --save @sentry/vue @sentry/tracing
```

```bash {tabTitle:Yarn}
yarn add @sentry/vue @sentry/tracing
```

The most basic configuration for tracing your Vue app, which would track only the top-level component, looks like this:

```js
import Vue from "vue";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/vue";
import { Integrations } from "@sentry/tracing";

Sentry.init({
  // ...
  integrations: [
    new Integrations.BrowserTracing(),
  ],

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

If you want to track child components, and see more details about the rendering process, configure the integration to track them all:

```js
Sentry.init({
  Vue,
  tracingOptions: {
    trackComponents: true,
  },
});
```
