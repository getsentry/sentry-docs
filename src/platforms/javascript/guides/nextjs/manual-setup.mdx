If you can’t (or prefer not to) run the [configuration step](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/#configure), you can follow the instructions below to configure your application.

## Set Initialization Config Files

Create two files in the root directory of your project, `sentry.client.config.js` and `sentry.server.config.js`. In these files, add your initialization code for the client-side SDK and server-side SDK, respectively. We've included some examples below.

For the client configuration:

```javascript {filename:sentry.client.config.js}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  // ...
  // Note: if you want to override the automatic release value, do not set a
  // `release` value here - use the environment variable `SENTRY_RELEASE`, so
  // that it will also get attached to your source maps
});
```

And the server configuration:

```javascript {filename:sentry.server.config.js}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  // ...
  // Note: if you want to override the automatic release value, do not set a
  // `release` value here - use the environment variable `SENTRY_RELEASE`, so
  // that it will also get attached to your source maps
});
```

If you want to instrument [Next.js API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction), which run on serverless, you need to wrap your handler in our `withSentry` wrapper in order to be able to capture crashes:

```javascript {filename:pages/api*}
import { withSentry } from '@sentry/nextjs';

const handler = async (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({ name: 'John Doe' })
}

export default withSentry(handler);
```

You can include your DSN directly in these two files, or provide it in either of two environment variables, `SENTRY_DSN` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN`.

## Extend Default Webpack Usage for Source Maps

Extend the default Next.js usage of Webpack to generate source maps and upload them to Sentry. Include the following in `next.config.js`:

```javascript {filename:next.config.js}
// This file sets a custom webpack configuration to use your Next.js app
// with Sentry.
// https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/introduction
// https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/

const { withSentryConfig } = require("@sentry/nextjs");

const moduleExports = {
  // your existing module.exports
};

const SentryWebpackPluginOptions = {
  // Additional config options for the Sentry Webpack plugin. Keep in mind that
  // the following options are set automatically, and overriding them is not
  // recommended:
  //   release, url, org, project, authToken, configFile, stripPrefix,
  //   urlPrefix, include, ignore

  silent: true, // Suppresses all logs
  // For all available options, see:
  // https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-webpack-plugin#options.
};

// Make sure adding Sentry options is the last code to run before exporting, to
// ensure that your source maps include changes from all other Webpack plugins
module.exports = withSentryConfig(moduleExports, SentryWebpackPluginOptions);
```

Make sure to add the Sentry config last; otherwise, the source maps the plugin receives may not be final.
Also keep in mind, by default we disable source map upload in `dev` mode when running `next dev` to not upload the source maps on every file change. If you build your app for production, we'll upload your source maps by default.

## Configure sentry-cli

The `SentryWebpackPlugin` uses `sentry-cli`, which can be configured in one of two ways - using a properties file, or with environment variables - both of which are discussed below. For full details, see [the CLI configuration docs](https://docs.sentry.io/product/cli/configuration/).

If you choose to combine the two approaches, the environment variables will take precedence over values set in the properties file. One common approach is to set sensitive data (like tokens) in the environment and include everything else in a properties file, which can then be added to your VCS.

### Properties File

You can create a `sentry.properties` file in the base directory of your project. (This is the approach taken by the wizard.) Here is an example:

```properties {filename:sentry.properties}
defaults.url=https://sentry.io/
defaults.org=___ORG_SLUG___
defaults.project=___PROJECT_SLUG___
auth.token=___TOKEN___
# cli.executable=../path/to/bin/sentry-cli
```

### Environment Variables

Alternatively, the cli can be configured using environment variables.

| Property name      | Environment variable |
| ------------------ | -------------------- |
| `defaults.url`     | `SENTRY_URL`         |
| `defaults.org`     | `SENTRY_ORG`         |
| `defaults.project` | `SENTRY_PROJECT`     |
| `auth.token`       | `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`  |
