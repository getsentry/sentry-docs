If you can't (or prefer not to) run the [automatic setup](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/#install), you can follow the instructions below to configure your application.

## Installation

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install --save @sentry/nextjs
```

```bash {tabTitle:Yarn}
yarn add @sentry/nextjs
```

```bash {tabTitle:pnpm}
pnpm add @sentry/nextjs
```

If you're updating your Sentry SDK to the latest version, check out our [migration guide](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/master/MIGRATION.md) to learn more about breaking changes.

## Create Initialization Config Files

Create three files in the root directory of your project, `sentry.client.config.js`, `sentry.server.config.js` and `sentry.edge.config.js`. In these files, add your initialization code for the client-side SDK and server-side SDK, respectively. We've included some examples below.

Please note that there are slight differences between these files since they run in different places (browser, server, edge), so copy them carefully!

<SignInNote />

```javascript {tabTitle:Client} {filename:sentry.client.config.(js|ts)}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  // Replay may only be enabled for the client-side
  integrations: [new Sentry.Replay()],

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for performance monitoring.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,

  // Capture Replay for 10% of all sessions,
  // plus for 100% of sessions with an error
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,

  // ...

  // Note: if you want to override the automatic release value, do not set a
  // `release` value here - use the environment variable `SENTRY_RELEASE`, so
  // that it will also get attached to your source maps
});
```

<SignInNote />

```javascript {tabTitle:Server} {filename:sentry.server.config.(js|ts)}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for performance monitoring.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,

  // ...

  // Note: if you want to override the automatic release value, do not set a
  // `release` value here - use the environment variable `SENTRY_RELEASE`, so
  // that it will also get attached to your source maps
});
```

<SignInNote />

```javascript {tabTitle:Edge} {filename:sentry.edge.config.(js|ts)}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for performance monitoring.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,

  // ...

  // Note: if you want to override the automatic release value, do not set a
  // `release` value here - use the environment variable `SENTRY_RELEASE`, so
  // that it will also get attached to your source maps
});
```

You can include your DSN directly in these three files, or provide it in either of two environment variables, `SENTRY_DSN` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN`.

## Extend your Next.js Configuration

Use `withSentryConfig` to extend the default Next.js usage of webpack. This will do two things:

- Automatically call SDK initialization code, at server start up and client page load.
- Generate and upload source maps to Sentry, so that your stack traces contain readable code.

Include the following in your `next.config.js` or `next.config.mjs`:

<SignInNote />

```JavaScript {filename:next.config.(js|mjs)}
// This file sets a custom webpack configuration to use your Next.js app
// with Sentry.
// https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/introduction

const { withSentryConfig } = require("@sentry/nextjs");

// your existing module.exports or default export
const nextConfig = {

  // Optional build-time configuration options
  sentry: {
    // See the sections below for information on the following options:
    //   'Configure Source Maps':
    //     - disableServerWebpackPlugin
    //     - disableClientWebpackPlugin
    //     - hideSourceMaps
    //     - widenClientFileUpload
    //   'Configure Legacy Browser Support':
    //     - transpileClientSDK
    //   'Configure Serverside Auto-instrumentation':
    //     - autoInstrumentServerFunctions
    //     - excludeServerRoutes
    //   'Configure Tunneling to avoid Ad-Blockers':
    //     - tunnelRoute
  },
};

const sentryWebpackPluginOptions = {
  // Additional config options for the Sentry webpack plugin. Keep in mind that
  // the following options are set automatically, and overriding them is not
  // recommended:
  //   release, url, configFile, stripPrefix, urlPrefix, include, ignore

  org: "___ORG_SLUG___",
  project: "___PROJECT_SLUG___",

  // An auth token is required for uploading source maps.
  authToken: process.env.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN,

  silent: true, // Suppresses all logs

  // For all available options, see:
  // https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-webpack-plugin#options.
};

// Make sure adding Sentry options is the last code to run before exporting
module.exports = withSentryConfig(nextConfig, sentryWebpackPluginOptions);

// If you're using a next.config.mjs file:
// export default withSentryConfig(nextConfig, sentryWebpackPluginOptions);
```

## Configure Source Maps

By default, `withSentryConfig` will add an instance of `SentryWebpackPlugin` to the webpack plugins, for both server and client builds. This means that when you run a production build (`next build`), sourcemaps will be generated and uploaded to Sentry, so that you get readable stack traces in your Sentry issues.

To configure the plugin, pass a `sentryWebpackPluginOptions` argument to `withSentryConfig`, as seen in the example above. All available options are documented [here](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-webpack-plugin#options).

### Disable `SentryWebpackPlugin`

If you choose to handle source map generation and uploading separately, the plugin can be disabled for either the server or client build process. To do this, add a `sentry` object to `nextConfig` above, and set the relevant options there:

```javascript {filename:next.config.(js|mjs)}
const nextConfig = {
  sentry: {
    disableServerWebpackPlugin: true,
    disableClientWebpackPlugin: true,
  },
};
```

Note that you'll also have to explicitly set a `release` value in your `Sentry.init()`.

If you disable the plugin for both server and client builds, it's safe to omit the `sentryWebpackPluginOptions` parameter from your `withSentryConfig` call:

```javascript {filename:next.config.(js|mjs)}
module.exports = withSentryConfig(nextConfig);
```

In that case you can also skip the `sentry-cli` configuration step below.

### Use `hidden-source-map`

_(New in version 6.17.1, will default to `true` in 8.0.0 and beyond.)_

Depending on your deployment setup, adding `sentry/nextjs` to your app may cause your source code to be visible in browser devtools when it wasn't before. (This happens because of the default behavior of [webpack's `source-map` built-in `devtool`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/).) To prevent this, you can use `hidden-source-map` rather than `source-map`, which will prevent your built files from containing a `sourceMappingURL` comment, thus making sourcemaps invisible to the browser. To use `hidden-source-map`, add a `sentry` object to `nextConfig` above, and set the `hideSourceMaps` option to `true`:

```javascript {filename:next.config.(js|mjs)}
const nextConfig = {
  sentry: {
    hideSourceMaps: true,
  },
};
```

Note that this only applies to client-side builds, and requires the `SentryWebpackPlugin` to be enabled. This option will default to `true` starting in version 8.0.0. See https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/ for more information.

### Widen the Upload Scope

If you find that there are in-app frames in your client-side stack traces that aren't getting source-mapped even when most others are, it's likely because they are from files in `static/chunks/` rather than `static/chunks/pages/`. By default, such files aren't uploaded because the majority of the files in `static/chunks/` only contain Next.js or third-party code, and are named in such a way that it's hard to distinguish between relevant files (ones containing your code) and irrelevant ones.

To upload all of the files in `static/chunks/` anyway, add a `sentry` object to `nextConfig` above, and set the `widenClientFileUpload` option to `true`:

```javascript {filename:next.config.(js|mjs)}
const nextConfig = {
  sentry: {
    widenClientFileUpload: true,
  },
};
```

## Configure `sentry-cli`

The `SentryWebpackPlugin` uses the `Sentry CLI` to manage releases and source maps, which can be configured in one of two ways - using a configuration file, or with environment variables - both of which are discussed below. For full details, see [the CLI configuration docs](/product/cli/configuration/).

If you choose to combine the two approaches, the environment variables will take precedence over values set in the configuration file. One common approach is to set sensitive data (like tokens) in the environment and include everything else in the configuration file added to your VCS.

The URL, organization, and project properties identify your organization and project, and the auth token authenticates your user account.

### Use Configuration Files for Source Map Upload

You can commit all the properties to your VCS, except the auth token. You can accomplish this by using the `.sentryclirc` file and including your auth token:

<OrgAuthTokenNote />

```ini {filename:.sentryclirc}
[auth]
token=___ORG_AUTH_TOKEN___
```

Don't forget to ignore `.sentryclirc` in your version control system to prevent it from being leaked!

### Use Environment Variables

Alternatively, the source map upload can be configured using environment variables.

| Property    | Environment variable |
| ----------- | -------------------- |
| `url`       | `SENTRY_URL`         |
| `org`       | `SENTRY_ORG`         |
| `project`   | `SENTRY_PROJECT`     |
| `authToken` | `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`  |

## Configure Legacy Browser Support

_(New in version 7.8.0)_

The `@sentry/nextjs` SDK is designed to run in browsers which support ES6 (and certain ES6+ language features like object spread). If you need to support older browsers, and have configured Next.js to down-compile your code, you can apply the same down-compilation to the injected SDK code by using the `transpileClientSDK` option in your Next.js config:

```javascript {filename:next.config.(js|mjs)}
const nextConfig = {
  sentry: {
    transpileClientSDK: true,
  },
};
```

(This assumes you are using [the `next.config.(js|mjs)` setup shown above](#extend-nextjs-configuration).)

## Configure Tunneling to avoid Ad-Blockers

_(New in version 7.26.0)_

You might notice that Sentry events are sometimes blocked by Ad-Blockers.
Ad-blockers can be circumvented by using **tunneling**.

The Sentry Next.js SDK provides an easy way to set up tunneling for your application.
Use the `tunnelRoute` option in the `sentry` object in your `next.config.js` or `next.config.mjs` to provide a route the SDK will use to tunnel events to Sentry:

```javascript {filename:next.config.(js|mjs)}
const nextConfig = {
  sentry: {
    tunnelRoute: "/monitoring-tunnel",
  },
};
```

Please note that this option will tunnel Sentry events through your Next.js application so you might experience increased server usage.

The `tunnelRoute` option does currently not work with self-hosted Sentry instances.

Learn more about tunneling in the <PlatformLink to="/troubleshooting/#dealing-with-ad-blockers">troubleshooting section</PlatformLink>.

## Configure Server-side Auto-instrumentation

The SDK will automatically instrument API routes and server-side [Next.js data fetching methods](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/overview) with error and performance monitoring.

### Disable API Route, Middleware and Data Fetching Auto-instrumentation Entirely

_(New in version 7.14.0)_

To disable the automatic instrumentation of API route handlers and server-side data fetching functions, set the `autoInstrumentServerFunctions` to `false`.

```javascript {filename:next.config.(js|mjs)}
const nextConfig = {
  sentry: {
    autoInstrumentServerFunctions: false,
  },
};
```

With this option, under the hood, the SDK is using a webpack loader to wrap all your API route handlers and data fetching methods.

### Opt In to Auto-instrumentation on Specific Routes

_(New in version 7.14.0)_

If the automatic instrumentation doesn't work for your use case, you can turn it off globally and choose to only wrap specific API route handlers or data fetching functions instead.

For API routes, use the `wrapApiHandlerWithSentry` function:

```javascript {filename:pages/api/*}
import { wrapApiHandlerWithSentry } from "@sentry/nextjs";

const handler = (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({ name: "John Doe" });
};

export default wrapApiHandlerWithSentry(handler, "/api/myRoute");
```

```typescript {filename:pages/api/*}
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";
import { wrapApiHandlerWithSentry } from "@sentry/nextjs";

const handler = (req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) => {
  res.status(200).json({ name: "John Doe" });
};

export default wrapApiHandlerWithSentry(handler, "/api/myRoute");
```

For data fetching methods, use the following functions:

- `wrapGetInitialPropsWithSentry` for `getInitialProps`
- `wrapGetServerSidePropsWithSentry` for `getServerSideProps`
- `wrapGetStaticPropsWithSentry` for `getStaticProps`
- `wrapErrorGetInitialPropsWithSentry` for `getInitialProps` in [custom Error pages](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-error-page)
- `wrapAppGetInitialPropsWithSentry` for `getInitialProps` in [custom `App` components](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-app)
- `wrapDocumentGetInitialPropsWithSentry` for `getInitialProps` in [custom `Document` components](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-document)

### Opt Out of Auto-instrumentation on Specific Routes

_(New in version 7.20.0)_

If you want auto-instrumentation to apply by default, but want to exclude certain routes, use the `excludeServerRoutes` option in the `sentry` object in your Next.js configuration file:

```javascript {filename:next.config.(js|mjs)}
const nextConfig = {
  sentry: {
    excludeServerRoutes: [
      "/some/excluded/route",
      "/excluded/route/with/[parameter]",
      /^\/route\/beginning\/with\/some\/prefix/,
      /\/routeContainingASpecificPathSegment\/?/,
    ],
  },
};
```

Excluded routes can be specified either as regexes or strings. When using a string, make sure that it matches the route exactly, and has a leading slash but no trailing one.

### Opt Out of Auto-instrumentation on Middleware

_(New in version 7.31.0)_

To disable the automatic instrumentation of Next.js middleware, set the `autoInstrumentMiddleware` option to `false`.

```javascript {filename:next.config.(js|mjs)}
const nextConfig = {
  sentry: {
    autoInstrumentMiddleware: false,
  },
};
```

### Opt Out of Auto-instrumentation of Vercel Cron Jobs

_(New in version 7.52.0)_

The Next.js SDK will automatically create [Cron Monitors](/product/crons/) in Sentry if you have configured [Vercel Cron Jobs](https://vercel.com/docs/cron-jobs).
To opt out of this functionality set the `automaticVercelMonitors` option to `false`.

```javascript {filename:next.config.(js|mjs)}
const nextConfig = {
  sentry: {
    automaticVercelMonitors: false,
  },
};
```

### Opt Out of Sentry SDK bundling in Client or Server side

If you want the `sentry` to be available in your server side & not in client side, you can make your `sentry.client.config.js` empty. This will prevent webpack from pulling in the Sentry related files when generating the browser bundle. The same goes the opposite for opting out of server side bundle by emptying `sentry.server.config.js`.

You cannot delete the respective config files because the SDK requires you to have it.
