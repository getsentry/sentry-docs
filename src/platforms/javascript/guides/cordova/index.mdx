This is the documentation for our Cordova SDK. The SDK uses a native extension for iOS and Android but will fall back to a pure JavaScript version (`@sentry/browser`) if needed. The SDK is able to catch native crashes that happen on iOS or uncaught exceptions on Android as well.

When you install `sentry-cordova` [Sentry Wizard](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-wizard) will help you to configure your project. We also add a build step to your Xcode project to upload debug symbols we need to symbolicate iOS crashes.

## Install

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-install" />

## Configure

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-config" />

### iOS Specifics

When you use Xcode, you can hook directly into the build process to upload debug symbols. If you however are using bitcode you will need to disable the “Upload Debug Symbols to Sentry” build phase and then separately upload debug symbols from iTunes Connect to Sentry.

### Run Script Phase

If the wizard ran successfully, it should have done setup all the necessary steps for you. You can still check if everything was setup correctly.

If you want to run the debug symbol upload during building your app. You can add this as a run script phase in Xcode. Also make sure to set the `DEBUG_INFORMATION_FORMAT` in your project settings to `DWARF and dSYM file`.

```bash
export SENTRY_PROPERTIES=sentry.properties
function getProperty {
    PROP_KEY=$1
    PROP_VALUE=`cat $SENTRY_PROPERTIES | grep "$PROP_KEY" | cut -d'=' -f2`
    echo $PROP_VALUE
}
if [ ! -f $SENTRY_PROPERTIES ]; then
    echo "warning: SENTRY: sentry.properties file not found! Skipping symbol upload."
    exit 0
fi
echo "# Reading property from $SENTRY_PROPERTIES"
SENTRY_CLI=$(getProperty "cli.executable")
SENTRY_COMMAND="../../$SENTRY_CLI upload-dif \"$DWARF_DSYM_FOLDER_PATH\""
$SENTRY_COMMAND
```

The next script makes sure that all unused architectures are striped from your binary when submitting the build to iTunes Connect.

If you are getting an error while submitting your build to iTunes Connect, this script is probably missing. Also re-adding the plugin helped some people.

```bash
# SENTRY_FRAMEWORK_PATCH
APP_PATH="${TARGET_BUILD_DIR}/${WRAPPER_NAME}"
find "$APP_PATH" -name '*.framework' -type d | while read -r FRAMEWORK
do
    FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_NAME=$(defaults read "$FRAMEWORK/Info.plist" CFBundleExecutable)
    FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH="$FRAMEWORK/$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_NAME"
    echo "Executable is $FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH"
    EXTRACTED_ARCHS=()

    for ARCH in $ARCHS
    do
        echo "Extracting $ARCH from $FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_NAME"
        lipo -extract "$ARCH" "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH" -o "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH-$ARCH"
        EXTRACTED_ARCHS+=("$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH-$ARCH")
    done

    echo "Merging extracted architectures: ${ARCHS}"
    lipo -o "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH-merged" -create "${EXTRACTED_ARCHS[@]}"
    rm "${EXTRACTED_ARCHS[@]}"
    echo "Replacing original executable with thinned version"
    rm "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH"
    mv "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH-merged" "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH"
done
```
