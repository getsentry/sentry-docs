Debug symbols provide information that Sentry displays on the Issue Details page to help you triage an issue.

<Note>

We do not currently support non-JavaScript automatic source map uploads or build scripts for Android. You must upload files manually [using our CLI](/product/cli/dif/#uploading-files).

</Note>

## JavaScript Source Maps

JavaScript Sourcemaps are automatically uploaded at build time when running `cordova build`.

## Uploading Using Xcode

To run the debug information upload when building your app, add the following as a run script phase in Xcode. Also make sure to set the `DEBUG_INFORMATION_FORMAT` in your project settings to `DWARF and dSYM file`.

```bash
export SENTRY_PROPERTIES=sentry.properties
function getProperty {
    PROP_KEY=$1
    PROP_VALUE=`cat $SENTRY_PROPERTIES | grep "$PROP_KEY" | cut -d'=' -f2`
    echo $PROP_VALUE
}
if [ ! -f $SENTRY_PROPERTIES ]; then
    echo "warning: SENTRY: sentry.properties file not found! Skipping symbol upload."
    exit 0
fi
echo "# Reading property from $SENTRY_PROPERTIES"
SENTRY_CLI=$(getProperty "cli.executable")
SENTRY_COMMAND="../../$SENTRY_CLI upload-dif \"$DWARF_DSYM_FOLDER_PATH\""
$SENTRY_COMMAND
```
