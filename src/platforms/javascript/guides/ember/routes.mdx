If you would like to capture timings for the `beforeModel`, `model`, `afterModel` hooks as well as `setupController` in one of your Routes, `@sentry/ember` exports a `instrumentRoutePerformance` function which can be used by replacing the default export with a wrapped Route.

```javascript
import Route from '@ember/routing/route';
import { instrumentRoutePerformance } from '@sentry/ember';

class MyRoute extends Route {
  model() {
    //...
  }
}

export default instrumentRoutePerformance(MyRoute);
```
