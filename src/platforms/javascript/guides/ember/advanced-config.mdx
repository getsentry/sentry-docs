description: Additional configuration options for Ember
---

The `@sentry/ember` addon includes options to manage Ember specific instrumentation; these options are set on the addon config directly. All Sentry SDK options that would be passed to `init` should instead be set in the `sentry` key inside your addon config as in this example:

```javascript
ENV['@sentry/ember'] = {
  // Ember specific options
  sentry: {
    // Sentry options
  }
};
```

The following documentation is for Ember specific configuration, for Sentry options, [see basic options](./configuration/basic-options)

### Performance Monitoring Considerations

The Sentry tracing integration is already set up via the Ember addon with custom Ember instrumentation for routing, components, and the runloop. It sideloads `@sentry/tracing` as a chunk to instrument your application. If you would like to disable this automatic instrumentation and no longer receive the associated transactions, you can set `disablePerformance` in your config as in this example:

```javascript
ENV['@sentry/ember'] = {
  disablePerformance: true
};
```

### Classic Components
The render times of classic components are also enabled by default, with a setting to capture render timings only above a certain duration. To change this minimum, you can modify `minimumComponentRenderDuration` in your config.

```javascript
  ENV['@sentry/ember'] = {
    minimumComponentRenderDuration: 0, // Setting this to zero will capture all classic components.
  };
```

To disable component instrumentation you can set `disableInstrumentComponents` in your config.
```javascript
ENV['@sentry/ember'] = {
  disableInstrumentComponents: true
};
```

### Runloop
The duration of each queue in your application's runloop is instrumented by default, as long as the duration of the queue is longer than a threshold defined in your config by `minimumRunloopQueueDuration`

```javascript
  ENV['@sentry/ember'] = {
    minimumRunloopQueueDuration: 0, // Setting this to zero will capture all runloop queue durations
  };
```

If you would like to disable runloop instrumentation you can set `disableRunloopPerformance` in your config.
```javascript
ENV['@sentry/ember'] = {
  disableRunloopPerformance: true
};
```
