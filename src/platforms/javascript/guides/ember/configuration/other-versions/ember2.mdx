If you're using `Ember 2.x`, you can use Sentry's Ember integration.

To use Sentry with your Ember application, you will need to use Sentryâ€™s browser JavaScript SDK: `@sentry/browser`.

On its own, `@sentry/browser` will report any uncaught exceptions triggered from your application.
To use ESM imports without any additional configuration, you can use `ember-auto-import`
by installing it with `ember install ember-auto-import`.

Starting with version `5.x` our `Ember` integration lives in its own `@sentry/integrations` package.
Install the package using either `npm` or `yarn`:

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install --save @sentry/integrations
```

```bash {tabTitle:yarn}
yarn add @sentry/integrations
```

Then add to your `app.js`:

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";
import { Ember as EmberIntegration } from "@sentry/integrations";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [new EmberIntegration()],
});
```

If you are using the CDN version or the Loader, we provide a standalone file for every integration, to set it up [check out our CDN documentation](/platforms/javascript/install/cdn)
