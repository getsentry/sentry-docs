<Note>

Browser Profiling is currently in beta. Beta features are still in progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.

</Note>

Because our JavaScript browser profiling integration is built on top of the profiler exposed by the [JS Self-Profiling API](https://wicg.github.io/js-self-profiling/), it's in beta and will likely only move out once the official spec progresses and gains adoption. As with any beta package, there are risks involved in using it. See platform [status.](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5170190448852992)

Unlike Chrome DevTools profiler, which runs locally and is intended primarily as a debugging tool, Sentry's JavaScript Profiler runs in production. It captures profiling data from real users and reflects real-world performance.

## Prerequisites
To get started with JavaScript profiling, you'll need to:

- Install the @sentry/browser SDK
- Configure the document response header to include `Document-Policy: js-profiling`
- Configure the SDK to use the BrowserProfilingIntegration and set profilesSampleRate

## Step 1: Install the JavaScript Browser SDK

Install our JavaScript browser SDK using either `yarn` or `npm`, the minimum version that supports profiling is **7.60.0**.

## Step 2: Add Document-Policy: js-profiling header

For the JavaScript browser profiler to start, the document response header needs to include a `Document-Policy` header key with the `js-profiling` value.

How you do this will depend on your server. If you're using a server like Express, you'll be able to use the [response.set](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.set) function.

```js
app.get("/", (request, response) => {
  response.set("Document-Policy", "js-profiling");
  response.sendFile("index.html");
});
```

```csharp
// ASP.NET Core
app.Use(async (context, next) => {
    context.Response.OnStarting(() => {
        context.Response.Headers.Append("Document-Policy", "js-profiling");
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    });
    await next();
});
```

##  Step 3: Configure the JavaScript SDK

Configuration should happen as early as possible in your application's lifecycle. Once this is done, Sentry's JavaScript SDK will capture all unhandled exceptions and transactions.

## The Difference Between DevTools & Sentry's JavaScript Browser Profiler

The main difference between Chrome DevTools and Sentry's JavaScript browser profiler is that DevTools is a developer tool for debugging problems in your code, whereas Sentry is a performance engineering tool for identifying performance bottlenecks in your system. Here are a few other notable differences:

- Sentry JavaScript profiler runs in production and captures real user data, showing real-world performance. DevTools runs locally on your machine and only shows profiles of what's running on your machine.
- Sentry runs at a lower sampling rate of 100Hz with a 10ms sample period versus a sampling rate of 1000Hz and a 1ms sample period for DevTools. 
- Sentry supports deobfuscation, making it so that all the function names in your code are correct. Typically, when you run JavaScript code, it's minified, meaning that all the function names are replaced with machine-generated abbreviations. 

Please note, that since the browser profiling API is currently only implemented in Chromium-based browsers, the profiles collected with Sentry's JavaScript browser profiling will inherently be biased toward  that demographic. This is something that you'll need to consider if you're basing your decisions on the data collected.

We hope that as the Javascript browser profiling API gains adoption, other browsers will implement it as well. If you find the browser profiling feature helpful and would like to see it gain further adoption, please consider supporting the spec at the official WICG repository.
