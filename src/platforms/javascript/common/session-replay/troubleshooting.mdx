This guide aims to extend the <PlatformLink to="/troubleshooting/">main troubleshooting</PlatformLink> guide covering Replay-specific scenarios.

## My `canvas` Elements Aren't Getting Captured

There's currently no support for `canvas`. It's being tracked in this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/6519). Feel free to üëç and help us prioritize it.

## My Custom CSS/Images/Fonts/Media Aren't Appearing When I View the Replay

The replay 'video' is actually a video-like reproduction of the HTML on your website. This means that all the external resources your site uses (CSS/Images/Fonts), will be rendered by the corresponding &lt;style&gt;, &lt;img&gt; and &lt;video&gt; tags on your site. Add `sentry.io` to your CORS policy so the iframe hosted on sentry.io can fetch and display these resources.

<Alert>

Due to [browser limitations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/use), SVGs containing `<use>` tags with links to your domain cannot be accessed from other origins, even if you add `sentry.io` to your CORS policy. This is a known issue and we are working on a solution.

</Alert>

## Replay on My Bowser Extension Doesn't Work

This is not a supported use-case. The replay package is built to work on a website and not as an externally-loaded script via browser extension or other mechanism. In fact, Sentry's Session Replay product can help developers find out when a third-party Chrome extension causes otherwise hard to debug or reproduce issues with their website.
