This guide aims to extend the <PlatformLink to="/troubleshooting/">main troubleshooting</PlatformLink> guide by covering Replay-specific scenarios.

## My `canvas` Elements Aren't Getting Captured

There's currently no support for `canvas`. It's being tracked in this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/6519). Feel free to üëç and help us prioritize it.

## My Custom CSS/Images/Fonts/Media Aren't Appearing When I View the Replay

The replay 'video' is actually a video-like reproduction of the HTML on your website. This means that all the external resources your site uses (CSS/Images/Fonts), will be rendered by the corresponding &lt;style&gt;, &lt;img&gt; and &lt;video&gt; tags on your site. Add `sentry.io` to your CORS policy so the iframe hosted on sentry.io can fetch and display these resources.

<Alert>

Due to [browser limitations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/use), SVGs containing `<use>` tags with links to your domain cannot be accessed from other origins, even if you add `sentry.io` to your CORS policy. This is a known issue and we are working on a solution.

</Alert>

## Why can't I see the full HTTP request body or all the headers?

By default, Replay will capture basic information about all outgoing fetch and XHR requests in your application. This includes the URL, request and response body size, method, and status code.
The intention is to limit the chance of collecting private data. You can <PlatformLink to="/session-replay/configuration/">configure the SDK to capture bodies and additional headers</PlatformLink>.

Another reason you might not see the body is if the format is not supported. We only capture text-based bodies, including JSON, XML, FormData, and similar data types. Any captured body will be truncated to 150k characters. When we identify the body as JSON, we will try to truncate it while keeping the payload valid JSON. Bodies of byte, file, or media types are not captured.

More details about this feature can be found in the <PlatformLink to="/session-replay/configuration/">configuration page</PlatformLink>.

## The SDK is slowing down my website.

If you're experiencing slowdowns on your website, first make sure you're on the latest version of our SDK, which will have the most up-to-date bug fixes and performance improvements.

We've identified two major potential reasons for impacted performance and have added several performance degradation safeguards as a result. The two culprits are websites that have a large numbers of mutations (Read the entry below to learn more.) and large console messages.

To mitigate these problems, SDK version 7.54.0 will [truncate console messages](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/7917) and disable Replay recordings on pages that have a large number of mutations.

If you're having any problems with the latest SDK version, we want to hear about it. Please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Type%3A+Bug&projects=&template=bug.yml) and describe your situation.

## I see the message: "A large number of mutations was detected (N). This can slow down the Replay SDK and impact your customers."

The Sentry SDK attempts to minimize potential [performance overhead](/product/session-replay/performance-overhead/#how-is-session-replay-optimized) in a few different ways. For example, by keeping track of the number of DOM mutations that are happening then disabling recording when a large number of changes are detected. Many simultaneous mutations can slow down a web page whether Session Replay is installed or not, but when a large number of mutations happen, the Replay client can incur an additional slowdown because it records each change.

If you're seeing the "A large number of mutations was detected" message while watching a replay, it means that your page could be optimized. For example, a dropdown list with thousands of entries could be refactored so that rows are virtualized where only the visible rows are rendered in the DOM. Another potential solution is to paginate the results fetch more data as the user scrolls through it. The SDK has a <PlatformLink to="/session-replay/configuration/#mutation-limits">configuration</PlatformLink> that allows you to configure the limits before recording stops.

## Text in the iframe isn't masked

Our masking logic doesn't run on iframe content that's provided using the `srcdoc` attribute, rather than loaded in via `src`.

To hide this content, block the iframe, as described in our Session Replay <PlatformLink to="/session-replay/privacy/#blocking">Privacy</PlatformLink> docs.

## Replay on My Browser Extension Doesn't Work

This is not a supported use-case. The replay package is built to work on a website and not as an externally-loaded script via browser extension or other mechanism. In fact, Sentry's Session Replay product can help developers find out when a third-party Chrome extension causes otherwise hard to debug or reproduce issues with their website.

## Response data for Apollo GraphQL Client network requests is not captured

Apollo Client sends an abort signal via `AbortController` whenever a query completes, to clean up and cancel all in-flight queries.
When this happens, the Replay can't capture the response body because the request is handled as aborted before Replay can access the response.

To avoid this, disable this behavior of Apollo Client by configuring your own abort signal:

```js
const abortController = new AbortController();

const httpLink = createHttpLink({
  // ... other options
  fetchOptions: {
    signal: abortController.signal, // overwrite the default abort signal
  },
});
```

With this configuration, Replay is able to capture response bodies from Apollo Client requests.
