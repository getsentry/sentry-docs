<Include name="beta-note-session-replay.mdx" />

With [session replays](/product/session-replay/) you can get to the root cause of an error or latency issue faster by seeing all the technical details related to that issue in one visual replay on your web application. Sentry provides a video-like reproduction of user interactions on a site or web app. All user interactions - including page visits, mouse movements, clicks, and scrolls - are captured, helping developers connect the dots between a known issue and how a user experienced it in the UI.

By default, it'll mask all fields, so no personally identifiable information (PII) is collected, eliminating any concerns with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Learn more on <PlatformLink to="/session-replay/privacy">Session Replay Privacy</PlatformLink>.

## Pre-requisites

For the sentry-replay integration to work, you must have the [Sentry browser SDK package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/browser), or an equivalent framework SDK (for example, [@sentry/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/react)) installed. The minimum version required for the SDK is `7.24.0`.

Make sure to use the exact same version of `@sentry/replay` as your other Sentry package(s), such as `@sentry/browser` or `@sentry/react`.

`@sentry/replay` requires Node 12+, and browsers newer than IE11.

## Install

<PlatformContent includePath="session-replay/install" />

## Set Up

<PlatformContent includePath="session-replay/setup" />

## User Session

A user session starts when the Session Replay SDK is first loaded and initialized. The session will continue until five minutes passes without any user interactions with the application **or** until a maximum of 30 minutes have elapsed. Closing the browser tab will end the session immediately according to the rules for [SessionStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage).

<Note>

An _interaction_ refers to either a mouse click or a browser navigation event.

### Replay Captures on Errors Only

Alternatively, rather than recording an entire session, you can capture a replay only when an error occurs. In this case, the integration will buffer up to one minute worth of events prior to the error being thrown. It will continue to record the session following the rules above regarding session life and activity. Read the [sampling](#sampling) section for configuration options.

## Sampling

Sampling allows you to control how much of your website's traffic will result in a session replay. There are two sample rates you can adjust to get the replays relevant to your interests:

1. <PlatformIdentifier name="replays-session-sample-rate" /> - The sample rate for replays that begin recording immediately and last the entirety of the user's session.
2. <PlatformIdentifier name="replays-on-error-sample-rate" /> - The sample rate for replays that are recorded when an error happens. This type of replay will record up to a minute of events prior to the error and continue recording until the session ends.

Sampling occurs when the session is first started. <PlatformIdentifier name="replays-session-sample-rate" /> is evaluated first. If it is sampled, then the replay recording begins. Otherwise, <PlatformIdentifier name="replays-on-error-sample-rate" /> is evaluated and if it is sampled, the integration will begin buffering the replay and will only upload a replay to Sentry when an error occurs. The remainder of the replay will behave similarly to a whole-session replay.

## Error Linking

Currently, errors that happen on the page while a replay is running are linked to the Replay, making it as easy as possible to jump between related issues and replays. However, it is **possible** that the error count reported on the **Replays Details** page does not match the actual errors that have been captured. This is because errors can be lost; for example, a network request may fail or similar. This shouldn't happen often, but it's theoretically possible.

## Verify

While you're testing, set <PlatformIdentifier name="replays-session-sample-rate" /> to `1.0`, as that ensures that every user session will be sent to Sentry.

Once testing is complete, **we recommend lowering this value in production**. We still recommend keeping <PlatformIdentifier name="replays-on-error-sample-rate" /> set to `1.0`.
