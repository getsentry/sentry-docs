<Include name="beta-note-session-replay.mdx" />

[Session Replay](/product/session-replay/) helps you get to the root cause of an error or latency issue faster by providing you with a video-like reproduction of what was happening in the user's browser before, during, and after the issue. Rewind and replay your application's DOM state, key user interactions like mouseclicks and scrolls, network requests, and console entries in a single combined UI inspired by your browser's DevTools.

By default, our Session Replay SDK masks all DOM text content, images, and user input, giving you heightened confidence that no sensitive data leaves the browser. To learn more, see <PlatformLink to="/session-replay/privacy">Session Replay Privacy</PlatformLink>.

## Install

<PlatformContent includePath="session-replay/install" />

## Set Up

<PlatformContent includePath="session-replay/setup" />

### Content Security Policy (CSP)

Session Replay uses a WebWorker to perform work (e.g. compression) off the main UI thread so as not to degrade the performance of your application. Add the below entry to make sure that workers can be loaded:

```
worker-src 'self' blob:
```

[Safari versions <= 15.4](https://caniuse.com/?search=worker-src) do not support `worker-src`, you will need to additionally add an entry for `child-src`:

```
child-src 'self' blob:
```

## User Session

A user session starts when the Session Replay SDK is first loaded and initialized. The session will continue until 5 minutes passes without any user interactions with the application **or** until a maximum of 60 minutes have elapsed. Closing the browser tab will end the session immediately according to the rules for [SessionStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage).

<Note>

An _interaction_ refers to either a mouse click or a browser navigation event.

</Note>

### Replay Captures on Errors Only

Alternatively, rather than recording an entire session, you can capture a replay only when an error occurs. In this case, the integration will buffer up to one minute worth of events prior to the error being thrown. It will continue to record the session following the rules above regarding session life and activity. Read the [sampling](#sampling) section for configuration options.

## Sampling

Sampling allows you to control how much of your website's traffic will result in a session replay. There are two sample rates you can adjust to get the replays relevant to your interests:

1. <PlatformIdentifier name="replays-session-sample-rate" /> - The sample rate for replays
   that begin recording immediately and last the entirety of the user's session.
2. <PlatformIdentifier name="replays-on-error-sample-rate" /> - The sample rate for replays
   that are recorded when an error happens. This type of replay will record up to a minute
   of events prior to the error and continue recording until the session ends.

Sampling occurs when the session is first started. <PlatformIdentifier name="replays-session-sample-rate" /> is evaluated first. If it is sampled, then the replay recording begins. Otherwise, <PlatformIdentifier name="replays-on-error-sample-rate" /> is evaluated and if it is sampled, the integration will begin buffering the replay and will only upload a replay to Sentry when an error occurs. The remainder of the replay will behave similarly to a whole-session replay.

## Error Linking

Currently, errors that happen on the page while a replay is running are linked to the Replay, making it as easy as possible to jump between related issues and replays. However, it is **possible** that the error count reported on the **Replays Details** page does not match the actual errors that have been captured. This is because errors can be lost; for example, a network request may fail or similar. This shouldn't happen often, but it's theoretically possible.

## Verify

While you're testing, set <PlatformIdentifier name="replays-session-sample-rate" /> to `1.0`, as that ensures that every user session will be sent to Sentry.

Once testing is complete, **we recommend lowering this value in production**. We still recommend keeping <PlatformIdentifier name="replays-on-error-sample-rate" /> set to `1.0`.
