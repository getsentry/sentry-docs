## General Integration Configuration

The following options can be configured on the root level of your browser-based Sentry SDK, in `init({})`:

| key                      | type    | default | description |
| ------------------------ | ------- | ------- | --- |
| replaysSessionSampleRate | number  | `0.1`   | The sample rate for replays that begin recording immediately and last the entirety of the user's session. 1.0 will collect all replays, 0 will collect no replays. |
| replaysOnErrorSampleRate | number  | `1.0`   | The sample rate for replays that are recorded when an error happens. This type of replay will record up to a minute of events prior to the error and continue recording until the session ends. 1.0 capturing all sessions with an error, and 0 capturing none. |

The following options can be configured as options to the integration, in `new Replay({})`:

| key                 | type    | default | description |
| ------------------- | ------- | ------- | --- |
| stickySession       | boolean | `true`  | Keep track of the user across page loads. Note a single user using multiple tabs will result in multiple sessions. Closing a tab will result in the session being closed as well.                                               |

## Optimization Configuration

The following options can be configured as options to the integration, in `new Replay({})`:

| key              | type    | default | description |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | ------- | --- |
| collectFonts     | boolean | `false` | Should collect fonts used on the website |
| inlineImages     | boolean | `false` | Should inline `<image>` content |
| inlineStylesheet | boolean | `true`  | Should inline stylesheets used in the recording |

## Identifying Users

You can use the Sentry SDK to set the user of a session. To associate a user identity to a session replay, refer to the <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/identify-user">Identifying User Docs</PlatformLink>.

```javascript
Sentry.setUser({ email: "jane.doe@example.com" });
```

## rrweb Configuration

In addition to the options described above, you can also directly pass configuration to [rrweb](https://github.com/rrweb-io/rrweb/blob/rrweb%401.1.3/guide.md), which is the underlying library used to make the recordings:

```javascript
new Replay({
  // any further configuration here is passed directly to rrweb
});
```

## Start and Stop Recording

Replay recording only starts automatically when it's included in the integrations key when calling `Sentry.init`. Otherwise, you can initialize the plugin and manually call the `start()` method on the integration instance. To stop recording you can call the `stop()`:

```javascript {tabTitle: ESM}
const replay = new Replay(); // This will *NOT* begin recording replays

replay.start(); // Start recording

replay.stop(); // Stop recording
```

```javascript {tabTitle: CDN}
const replay = new Sentry.Integrations.Replay(); // This will *NOT* begin recording replays

replay.start(); // Start recording

replay.stop(); // Stop recording
```

## Privacy

We take privacy seriously so we provide a number of privacy-oriented settings. Learn more about these in our our<PlatformLink to="/session-replay/privacy/#privacy-configuration">Session Replay privacy documentation</PlatformLink>.
