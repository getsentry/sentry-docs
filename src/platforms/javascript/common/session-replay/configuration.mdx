## General Integration Configuration

The following options can be configured on the root level of your browser-based Sentry SDK, in `init({})`:

| Key                      | Type   | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------ | ------ | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| replaysSessionSampleRate | number | `0`     | The sample rate for replays that begin recording immediately and last the entirety of the user's session. `1.0` collects all replays, and `0` collects none.                                                                                                      |
| replaysOnErrorSampleRate | number | `0`     | The sample rate for replays that are recorded when an error happens. This type of replay will record up to a minute of events prior to the error and continue recording until the session ends. `1.0` captures all sessions with an error, and `0` captures none. |

The following options can be configured as options to the integration, in `new Replay({})`:

| Key           | Type    | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------- | ------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| stickySession | boolean | `true`  | Keep track of the user across page loads. Note, a single user using multiple tabs will result in multiple sessions. Closing a tab will result in the session being closed as well. |

## Identifying Users

You can use the Sentry SDK to set the user of a session. To associate a user identity to a session replay, refer to the <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/identify-user">Identifying User Docs</PlatformLink>.

```javascript
Sentry.setUser({ email: "jane.doe@example.com" });
```

## Start and Stop Recording

Replay recording starts if it's included in the `integrations` array when calling `Sentry.init` or, when `addIntegration` is called from a Sentry client instance. To stop recording, call `stop()`:

```javascript
const replay = new Sentry.Replay();

// Load replay when you configure Sentry SDK
Sentry.init({
  integrations: [replay],
});

// Or if you want to defer loading Replay
getCurrentHub()
  .getClient()
  .addIntegration(replay);

// sometime later
await replay.flush(); // wait for any pending recording data to be sent
replay.stop();

replay.start();
```
