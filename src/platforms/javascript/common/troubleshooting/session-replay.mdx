# Troubleshooting Replay specific issues

This guides aims to extend the <PlatformLink to="/troubleshooting/">main troubleshooting</PlatformLink> guide covering Replay-specific scenarios.

## My `canvas` elements are not getting captured.

Currently there's not support for `canvas`. This feature is being tracked on this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/6519).
Please feel free to üëç to help us prioritize it.

##  My custom CSS/Images/Fonts/Media are not appearing when I view the replay

The replay 'video' is actually a video-like reproduction of the HTML on your website. This means that all the external resources your site uses (CSS/Images/Fonts) will be rendered by the corresponding &lt;style&gt;, &lt;img&gt; and &lt;video&gt; tags on your site. 
Add `sentry.io` to your CORS policy so the iframe hosted on sentry.io can fetch and display these resources. 

## Replay on my browser extension doesn't work?

This is not a supported scenario. The replay SDK is build to work on a website, and not on externally loaded script via browser extension or other mechanism.
In fact, Sentry's Session Replay product can help developers find out when a third-party Chrome Extension causes issues with their websites which are otherwise hard to debug or reproduce.
