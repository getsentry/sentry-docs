## Support for IE11 / ES5

The Sentry JavaScript SDK use ES6 syntax & functionality in order to provide the best possible user experience. If you want to provide support for IE11 (or other environments that do not support ES6), you need to make sure to transpile your code accordingly - this can be done in all bundlers like Webpack, Vite, Rollup, etc.

Please note that we do use some ES6-only features that you'll need to provide polyfills for if you want to use them in ES5. You can view examples for this [here](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/develop/rollup/polyfills/es5.js).

Alternatively, you can also use our <PlatformLink to="/install/loader/#available-bundles">ES5 CDN bundles</PlatformLink>.
