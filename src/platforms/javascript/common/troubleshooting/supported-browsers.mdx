## Support for IE11 / ES5

The Sentry JavaScript SDK uses ES6 syntax and functionality to provide the best possible user experience. If you want to support IE11 (or other environments that do not support ES6), you need to transpile your code using a bundler like webpack, Vite, Rollup, etc.

We do use some ES6-only features. If you want to use them in ES5, you'll need to provide polyfills. [Here is an example](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/develop/rollup/polyfills/es5.js) of how to do this.

Alternatively, you can use our [ES5 CDN bundles](/platforms/javascript/install/loader/#available-bundles).
