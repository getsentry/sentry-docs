The `@sentry/tracing` package provides a `BrowserTracing` integration to add automatic instrumentation for monitoring the performance of browser applications. By default, this integration will create a new transaction for each page load and navigation event, and will create a child span for every `XMLHttpRequest` or `fetch` request which occurs while those transactions are open.

To enable this automatic tracing, include the `BrowserTracing` integration in your SDK configuration options. (Note that when using ESM modules, the main `@sentry/*` import must come before the `@sentry/tracing` import.)

```javascript {tabTitle: ESM}
// If you're using one of our integration packages, like `@sentry/react` or `@sentry/angular`,
// substitute its name for `@sentry/browser` here
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";
import { Integrations as TracingIntegrations } from "@sentry/tracing"; // Must import second

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  integrations: [
    new Integrations.BrowserTracing({
      tracingOrigins: ["localhost", "my-site-url.com", /^\//],
      // ... other options
    }),
  ],

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

```javascript {tabTitle: CDN}
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  integrations: [
    new Sentry.Integrations.BrowserTracing({
      tracingOrigins: ["localhost", "my-site-url.com", /^\//],
      // ... other options
    }),
  ],

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

After configuration, you should see both `pageload` and `navigation` transactions show up in your Sentry UI.

## Options

You can pass many different options to the `BrowserTracing` integration (as an object of the form `{optionName: value}`), but it comes with reasonable defaults out of the box. For all possible options, see [TypeDocs](https://getsentry.github.io/sentry-javascript/interfaces/tracing.browsertracingoptions.html).

### tracingOrigins

Usage:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    new Integrations.BrowserTracing({
      tracingOrigins: ["localhost", "my-site-url.com"],
    }),
  ],

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

The default value of `tracingOrigins` is `['localhost', /^\//]`. The JavaScript SDK will attach the `sentry-trace` header to all outgoing XHR/fetch requests whose destination contains a string in the list or matches a regex in the list. If your frontend is making requests to a different domain, you will need to add it there to propagate the `sentry-trace` header to the backend services, which is required to link transactions together as part of a single trace. **One important thing to note is that the `tracingOrigins` option matches against the whole request URL, not just the domain. Using stricter regex to match certain parts of the URL can help make sure that requests do not unnecessarily have the `sentry-trace` header attached.**

_Example:_

- A frontend application is served from `example.com`
- A backend service is served from `api.example.com`
- The frontend application makes API calls to the backend
- Therefore, the option needs to be configured like this: `new Integrations.BrowserTracing({tracingOrigins: ['api.example.com']})`
- Now outgoing XHR/fetch requests to `api.example.com` will get the `sentry-trace` header attached

_NOTE:_ You need to make sure your web server CORS is configured to allow the `sentry-trace` header. The configuration might look like `"Access-Control-Allow-Headers: sentry-trace"`, but the configuration depends on your set up. If you do not allow the `sentry-trace` header, the request might be blocked.

### beforeNavigate

For `pageload` and `navigation` transactions, the `BrowserTracing` integration uses the browser's `window.location` API to generate a transaction name. To customize the name of the `pageload` and `navigation` transactions, you can supply a `beforeNavigate` option to the `BrowserTracing` integration. This option allows you to modify the transaction name to make it more generic, so that, for example, transactions named `GET /users/12312012` and `GET /users/11212012` can both be renamed `GET /users/:userid`, so that they'll group together.

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";
import { Integrations } from "@sentry/tracing";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    new Integrations.BrowserTracing({
      beforeNavigate: context => {
        return {
          ...context,
          // You could use your UI's routing library to find the matching
          // route template here. We don't have one right now, so do some basic
          // parameter replacements.
          name: location.pathname
            .replace(/\d+/g, "<digits>")
            .replace(/[a-f0-9]{32}/g, "<hash>"),
        };
      },
    }),
  ],

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

### shouldCreateSpanForRequest

This function can be used to filter out unwanted spans such as XHR's running health checks or something similar. By default `shouldCreateSpanForRequest` already filters out everything but what was defined in `tracingOrigins`.

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";
import { Integrations } from "@sentry/tracing";
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    new Integrations.BrowserTracing({
      shouldCreateSpanForRequest: url => {
        // Do not create spans for outgoing requests to a `/health/` endpoint
        return !url.match(/\/health\/?$/);
      },
    }),
  ],

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```
