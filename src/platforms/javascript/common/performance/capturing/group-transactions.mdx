When Sentry captures transactions, they are assigned a transaction name. This name is generally auto-generated by the Sentry SDK based on the framework integrations you are using. If you can't leverage the automatic transaction generation (or want to customize how transaction names are generated) you can use a global event processor that is registered when you initialize the SDK with your configuration.

An example of doing this in a node.js application:

```javascript
import { addGlobalEventProcessor } from "@sentry/node";

addGlobalEventProcessor(event => {
  // if event is a transaction event
  if (event.type === "transaction") {
    event.transaction = sanitizeTransactionName(event.transaction);
  }
  return event;
});
```

For browser JavaScript applications using the `BrowserTracing` integration, the `beforeNavigate` option can be used to better group `navigation`/`pageload` transactions together based on URL.

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";
import { Integrations } from "@sentry/tracing";

Sentry.init({
  // ...
  integrations: [
    new Integrations.BrowserTracing({
      beforeNavigate: context => {
        return {
          ...context,
          // You could use your UI's routing library to find the matching
          // route template here. We don't have one right now, so do some basic
          // parameter replacements.
          name: location.pathname
            .replace(/\d+/g, "<digits>")
            .replace(/[a-f0-9]{32}/g, "<hash>"),
        };
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```
