Capturing transactions requires that you first <PlatformLink to="/performance/">set up tracing in your app</PlatformLink> if you haven't already.

## Configuration Options

<PlatformSection supported={["javascript.nextjs"]} notSupported={["javascript"]}>

Though the `BrowserTracing` integration is automatically enabled in `@sentry/nextjs`, in order to customize its options you must include it in your `Sentry.init` in `sentry.client.config.js`:

<SignInNote />

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  integrations: [new Sentry.BrowserTracing()],

  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  // Set `tracePropagationTargets` to control for which URLs distributed tracing should be enabled
  tracePropagationTargets: [
    "localhost",
    /^\//,
    /^https:\/\/yourserver\.io\/api/,
  ],
});
```

</PlatformSection>

Supported options:

### tracePropagationTargets

<Note>

The `tracingOrigins` option was renamed `tracePropagationTargets` and deprecated in [version `7.19.0`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/releases/tag/7.19.0) of the JavaScript SDK. `tracingOrigins` will be removed in version 8.

</Note>

A list of strings and regular expressions. The JavaScript SDK will attach the `sentry-trace` and `baggage` headers to all outgoing XHR/fetch requests whose destination contains a string in the list or matches a regex in the list. If your frontend is making requests to a different domain, you'll need to add it there to propagate the `sentry-trace` and `baggage` headers to the backend services, which is required to link transactions together as part of a single trace.

**The `tracePropagationTargets` option matches the entire request URL, not just the domain. Using stricter regex to match certain parts of the URL ensures that requests don't unnecessarily have additional headers attached.**

The default value of `tracePropagationTargets` is `['localhost', /^\//]`. This means that by default, tracing headers are only attached to requests that contain `localhost` in their URL or requests whose URL starts with a `'/'` (for example `GET /api/v1/users`).

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/tracePropagationTargets-example" />

You will need to configure your web server [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Headers) to allow the `sentry-trace` and `baggage` headers. The configuration might look like `"Access-Control-Allow-Headers: sentry-trace"` and `"Access-Control-Allow-Headers: baggage"`, but it depends on your set up. If you do not allow the two headers, the request might be blocked.

### beforeNavigate

`beforeNavigate` is called at the start of every `pageload` or `navigation` transaction, and is passed an object containing the data with the transaction will be started. Using `beforeNavigate` gives you the option to modify that data, or drop the transaction entirely by returning `undefined`.

### shouldCreateSpanForRequest

This function can be used to filter out unwanted spans such as XHRs running
health checks or something similar. If this function isn't specified, spans
will be created for all requests.

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/filter-span-example" />

### idleTimeout

The idle time, measured in ms, to wait until the transaction will be finished, if there are no unfinished spans. The transaction will use the end timestamp of the last finished span as the endtime for the transaction.

The default is `1000`.

### finalTimeout

The maximum duration of the transaction, measured in ms. If the transaction duration hits the `finalTimeout` value, it will be finished.

The default is `30000`.

### heartbeatInterval

The time, measured in ms, one heartbeat takes. If no new spans were started or no open spans finished within **three heartbeats**, the transaction will be finished. The heartbeat count restarts whenever a new span is created or an open span is finished.

The default is `5000`.

### startTransactionOnLocationChange

This flag enables or disables creation of `navigation` transaction on history changes.

The default is `true`.

### startTransactionOnPageLoad

This flag enables or disables creation of `pageload` transaction on first pageload.

The default is `true`.

### markBackgroundTransactions

This option flags transactions when tabs are moved to the background with "cancelled". Because browser background tab timing is not suited for precise measurements of operations and can affect your statistics in nondeterministic ways, we recommend that this option be enabled.

The default is `true`.

### enableLongTask

This option determines whether spans for long tasks automatically get created.

The default is `true`.
