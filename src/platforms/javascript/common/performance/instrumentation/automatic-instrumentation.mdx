Capturing transactions requires that you first <PlatformLink to="/performance/">set up tracing in your app</PlatformLink> if you haven't already.

## Configuration Options

<PlatformSection supported={["javascript.nextjs"]} notSupported={["javascript"]}>

Though the `BrowserTracing` integration is automatically enabled in `@sentry/nextjs`, in order to customize its options you must include it in your `Sentry.init` in `sentry.client.config.js`:

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  integrations: [
    new Sentry.Integrations.BrowserTracing({
      // custom options
    }),
  ],

  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

</PlatformSection>

Supported options:

### tracingOrigins

The default value of `tracingOrigins` is `['localhost', /^\//]`. The JavaScript SDK will attach the `sentry-trace` header to all outgoing XHR/fetch requests whose destination contains a string in the list or matches a regex in the list. If your frontend is making requests to a different domain, you will need to add it there to propagate the `sentry-trace` header to the backend services, which is required to link transactions together as part of a single trace. **The `tracingOrigins` option matches against the whole request URL, not just the domain. Using stricter regex to match certain parts of the URL ensures that requests do not unnecessarily have the `sentry-trace` header attached.**

You will need to configure your web server [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Headers) to allow the `sentry-trace` header. The configuration might look like `"Access-Control-Allow-Headers: sentry-trace"`, but the configuration depends on your set up. If you do not allow the `sentry-trace` header, the request might be blocked.

### beforeNavigate

`beforeNavigate` is called at the start of every `pageload` or `navigation` transaction, and is passed the an object containing the data with with the transaction will be started. Using `beforeNavigate` gives you the option to modify that data, or drop the transaction entirely by returning `undefined`.

### shouldCreateSpanForRequest

This function can be used to filter out unwanted spans such as XHR's running health checks or something similar. Whether specified or not, `shouldCreateSpanForRequest` filters out everything but what was defined in `tracingOrigins`.

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/filter-span-example" />

### idleTimeout

The idle time, measured in ms, to wait until the transaction will be finished. The transaction will use the end timestamp of the last finished span as the endtime for the transaction.

The default is `1000`.

### startTransactionOnLocationChange

This flag enables or disables creation of `navigation` transaction on history changes.

The default is `true`.

### startTransactionOnPageLoad

This flag enables or disables creation of `pageload` transaction on first pageload.

The default is `true`.

### maxTransactionDuration

The maximum duration of a transaction, measured in seconds, before it will be marked as "deadline_exceeded". If you never want transactions marked that way, set `maxTransactionDuration` to 0.

The default is `600`.

### markBackgroundTransactions

This option flags transactions when tabs are moved to the background with "cancelled". Because browser background tab timing is not suited for precise measurements of operations and can affect your statistics in nondeterministic ways, we recommend that this option be enabled.

The default is `true`.
