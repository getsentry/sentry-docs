<Alert level="info" title="Note"><markdown>

The `BrowserTracing` package is designed to work with `@sentry/tracing` and one of our browser JavaScript packages (`@sentry/browser`, `@sentry/react`, `@sentry/angular` etc.) and requires those packages to be installed and set up. For information on how to configure performance, see [the Performance documentation](./)

You can pass many different options to the `BrowserTracing` integration (as an object of the form `{optionName: value}`), but it comes with reasonable defaults out of the box. For all possible options, see [TypeDocs](https://getsentry.github.io/sentry-javascript/interfaces/tracing.browsertracingoptions.html).

### tracingOrigins

Usage:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    new Integrations.BrowserTracing({
      tracingOrigins: ["localhost", "my-site-url.com"],
    }),
  ],
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0, // Be sure to lower this in production
});
```

The default value of `tracingOrigins` is `['localhost', /^\//]`. The JavaScript SDK will attach the `sentry-trace` header to all outgoing XHR/fetch requests whose destination contains a string in the list or matches a regex in the list. If your frontend is making requests to a different domain, you will need to add it there to propagate the `sentry-trace` header to the backend services, which is required to link transactions together as part of a single trace. **One important thing to note is that the `tracingOrigins` option matches against the whole request URL, not just the domain. Using stricter regex to match certain parts of the URL can help make sure that requests do not unnecessarily have the `sentry-trace` header attached.**

_Example:_

- A frontend application is served from `example.com`
- A backend service is served from `api.example.com`
- The frontend application makes API calls to the backend
- Therefore, the option needs to be configured like this: `new Integrations.BrowserTracing({tracingOrigins: ['api.example.com']})`
- Now outgoing XHR/fetch requests to `api.example.com` will get the `sentry-trace` header attached

_NOTE:_ You need to make sure your web server CORS is configured to allow the `sentry-trace` header. The configuration might look like `"Access-Control-Allow-Headers: sentry-trace"`, but this depends a lot on your setup. If you do not allow the `sentry-trace` header, the request might be blocked.

### beforeNavigate

For `pageload` and `navigation` transactions, the `BrowserTracing` integration uses the browser's `window.location` API to generate a transaction name. To customize the name of the `pageload` and `navigation` transactions, you can supply a `beforeNavigate` option to the `BrowserTracing` integration. This option allows you to pass in a function that takes in the location at the time of navigation and returns a new transaction name.

`beforeNavigate` is useful if you would like to leverage the routes from a custom routing library like `React Router` or if you want to reduce the cardinality of particular transactions.

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";
import { Integrations } from "@sentry/tracing";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    new Integrations.BrowserTracing({
      beforeNavigate: context => {
        return {
          ...context,
          // You could use your UI's routing library to find the matching
          // route template here. We don't have one right now, so do some basic
          // parameter replacements.
          name: location.pathname
            .replace(/\d+/g, "<digits>")
            .replace(/[a-f0-9]{32}/g, "<hash>"),
        };
      },
    }),
  ],
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0, // Be sure to lower this in production
});
```
