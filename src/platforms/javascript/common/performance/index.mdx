Performance Monitoring helps you see everything from macro-level metrics to micro-level spans, and youâ€™ll be able to cross-reference transactions with related issues, customize queries based on your personal needs, and substantially more.

To get started with performance monitoring using Sentry's JavaScript SDK, first install the `@sentry/browser` and `@sentry/tracing` packages:

```bash
# Using yarn
$ yarn add @sentry/browser @sentry/tracing

# Using npm
$ npm install @sentry/browser @sentry/tracing
```

<Alert level="warning" title="Note"><markdown>

We switched our package name from `@sentry/apm` to `@sentry/tracing`. If you were previously using `@sentry/apm`, please see [Switching to @sentry/tracing](/product/performance/apm-to-tracing/).

</markdown></Alert>

Next, import in the `@sentry/tracing` package. For added functionality, we recommend adding the `BrowserTracing` integration to your Sentry.init:

```JavaScript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";
import { Integrations } from "@sentry/tracing";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  release: "my-project-name@" + process.env.npm_package_version,
  integrations: [new Integrations.BrowserTracing()],
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0, // Be sure to lower this in production
});
```

Alternatively, instead of npm packages, you can use our pre-built CDN bundle that combines both `@sentry/browser` and `@sentry/tracing`:

<JsCdnTag tracing />

Next, initialize the integration in your call to `Sentry.init`:

```js
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [new Sentry.Integrations.BrowserTracing()],
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0, // Be sure to lower this in production
});
```

Performance data is transmitted using a new event type called "transactions," which you can learn about in [Distributed Tracing](/performance-monitoring/distributed-tracing/#traces-transactions-and-spans). **To capture transactions, you must install the performance package and configure your SDK to set the `tracesSampleRate` configuration to a nonzero value.** The example configuration above will transmit 100% of captured transactions. Be sure to lower this value in production otherwise you could burn through your quota quickly.

## Automatic Instrumentation

For `@sentry/browser`, we provide an integration called `BrowserTracing` that enables automatic instrumentation in the browser. The `BrowserTracing` integration creates `pageload` and `navigation` transactions containing spans for XHR/fetch requests and [Performance API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance) entries such as marks, measures, and resource timings.

_NOTE_: The `BrowserTracing` integration is specific to `@sentry/browser`. It does not work with `@sentry/node`.

The `BrowserTracing` integration resides in the `@sentry/tracing` package. You can add it to your `Sentry.init` call:

```javascript
// Without CDN

import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";
import { Integrations } from "@sentry/tracing";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [new Integrations.BrowserTracing()],
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0, // Be sure to lower this in production
});

// With CDN

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [new Sentry.Integrations.BrowserTracing()],
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0, // Be sure to lower this in production
});
```

_NOTE_: The `BrowserTracing` integration is available under `Sentry.Integrations.BrowserTracing` when using the CDN bundle.

To send traces, you will need to set the `tracesSampleRate` to a nonzero value. The configuration above will capture 100% of your transactions. By default, the `pageload` and `navigation` transactions set a transaction name using `window.location.pathname`.

To learn more about automatic instrumentation in the browser and the `BrowserTracing` integration, please see [Configuring BrowserTracing](./browsertracing/)

## Manual Instrumentation

To manually instrument certain regions of your code, you can create a transaction to capture them.
This is valid for both JavaScript Browser and Node and works independently of automatic instrumentation provided by the the `BrowserTracing` integration.

```javascript
const transaction = Sentry.startTransaction({ name: "test-transaction" });
const span = transaction.startChild({ op: "functionX" }); // This function returns a Span
// functionCallX
span.finish(); // Remember that only finished spans will be sent with the transaction
transaction.finish(); // Finishing the transaction will send it to Sentry
```

Here is a different example. If you want to create a transaction for a user interaction on your page, you need to do the following:

```javascript
// Let's say this function is invoked when a user clicks on the checkout button of your shop
shopCheckout() {
  // This will create a new Transaction for you
  const transaction = Sentry.startTransaction('shopCheckout');
  // set the transaction on the scope so it picks up any errors
  hub.configureScope(scope => scope.setSpan(transaction));

  // Assume this function makes an xhr/fetch call
  const result = validateShoppingCartOnServer();

  const span = transaction.startChild({
    data: {
      result
    },
    op: 'task',
    description: `processing shopping cart result`,
  });
  processAndValidateShoppingCart(result);
  span.finish();

  transaction.finish();
}
```

This example will send a transaction `shopCheckout` to Sentry. The transaction will contain a `task` span that measures how long `processAndValidateShoppingCart` took. Finally, the call to `transaction.finish()` will finish the transaction and send it to Sentry.

### Adding Additional Spans to the Transaction

The next example contains the implementation of the hypothetical `processItem` function called from the code snippet in the previous section. Our SDK can determine if there is currently an open transaction and add to it all newly created spans as child operations. Keep in mind that each individual span needs to be manually finished; otherwise, that span will not show up in the transaction.

```javascript
function processItem(item, transaction) {
  const span = transaction.startChild({
    op: "http",
    description: "GET /",
  });

  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    http.get(`/items/${item.id}`, response => {
      response.on("data", () => {});
      response.on("end", () => {
        span.setTag("http.status_code", response.statusCode);
        span.setData("http.foobarsessionid", getFoobarSessionid(response));
        span.finish();
        resolve(response);
      });
    });
  });
}
```

### Grouping Transactions

When Sentry captures transactions, they are assigned a transaction name. This name is generally auto-generated by the Sentry SDK based on the framework integrations you are using. If you can't leverage the automatic transaction generation (or want to customize how transaction names are generated) you can use a global event processor that is registered when you initialize the SDK with your configuration.

An example of doing this in a node.js application:

```javascript
import { addGlobalEventProcessor } from "@sentry/node";

addGlobalEventProcess(event => {
  // if event is a transaction event
  if (event.type === "transaction") {
    event.transaction = sanitizeTransactionName(event.transaction);
  }
  return event;
});
```

For browser JavaScript applications using the `BrowserTracing` integration, the `beforeNavigate` option can be used to better group navigation/pageload transactions together based on URL.

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";
import { Integrations } from "@sentry/tracing";

Sentry.init({
  // ...
  integrations: [
    new Integrations.BrowserTracing({
      beforeNavigate: context => {
        return {
          ...context,
          // You could use your UI's routing library to find the matching
          // route template here. We don't have one right now, so do some basic
          // parameter replacements.
          name: location.pathname
            .replace(/\d+/g, "<digits>")
            .replace(/[a-f0-9]{32}/g, "<hash>"),
        };
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Retrieving a Transaction

In cases where you want to attach Spans to an already ongoing Transaction you can use `Sentry.getCurrentHub().getScope().getTransaction()`. This function will return a `Transaction` in case there is a running Transaction on the scope, otherwise it returns `undefined`. If you are using our BrowserTracing integration by default we attach the Transaction to the Scope. So you could do something like this:

```javascript
function myJsFunction() {
  const transaction = Sentry.getCurrentHub()
    .getScope()
    .getTransaction();
  if (transaction) {
    let span = transaction.startChild({
      op: "encode",
      description: "parseAvatarImages",
    });
    // Do something
    span.finish();
  }
}
```

### Adding Query Information and Parameters to Spans

Currently, every tag has a maximum character limit of 200 characters. Tags over the 200 character limit will become truncated, losing potentially important information. To retain this data, you can split data over several tags instead.

For example, a 200+ character tagged request:

`https://empowerplant.io/api/0/projects/ep/setup_form/?user_id=314159265358979323846264338327&tracking_id=EasyAsABC123OrSimpleAsDoReMi&product_name=PlantToHumanTranslator&product_id=161803398874989484820458683436563811772030917980576`

The 200+ character request above will become truncated to:

`https://empowerplant.io/api/0/projects/ep/setup_form/?user_id=314159265358979323846264338327&tracking_id=EasyAsABC123OrSimpleAsDoReMi&product_name=PlantToHumanTranslator&product_id=1618033988749894848`

Instead, using `span.set_tag` and `span.set_data` preserves the details of this query using structured metadata. This could be done over `baseUrl`, `endpoint`, and `parameters`:

```javascript
const baseUrl = "https://empowerplant.io";
const endpoint = "/api/0/projects/ep/setup_form";
const parameters = {
  user_id: 314159265358979323846264338327,
  tracking_id: "EasyAsABC123OrSimpleAsDoReMi",
  product_name: PlantToHumanTranslator,
  product_id: 161803398874989484820458683436563811772030917980576,
};

const span = transaction.startChild({
  op: "request",
  description: "setup form",
});

span.setTag("baseUrl", baseUrl);
span.setTag("endpoint", endpoint);
span.setData("parameters", parameters);
// you may also find some parameters to be valuable as tags
span.setData("user_id", parameters.user_id);
http.get(`${base_url}/${endpoint}/`, (data = parameters));
```
