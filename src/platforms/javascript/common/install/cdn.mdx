import JsBundleList from "~src/components/jsBundleList";

Sentry supports loading the JavaScript SDK from a CDN. Generally we suggest using our npm package (`@sentry/browser`) instead, as using the CDN can create scenarios where Sentry is unable to load due to networking issues or common extensions like ad blockers. If you _must_ use a CDN, take a look at [loading Sentry lazily with our JS loader](../lazy-load-sentry/), which provides a deferred version of our minified ES5 browser bundle. To see what other bundles are available, see [Available Bundles](#available-bundles) below.

## Default Bundle

To use Sentry for error and performance monitoring, you can use the following bundle:

```html {tabTitle: CDN}
<script
  src="https://browser.sentry-cdn.com/{{ packages.version('sentry.javascript.browser') }}/bundle.tracing.min.js"
  integrity="sha384-{{ packages.checksum('sentry.javascript.browser', 'bundle.tracing.min.js', 'sha384-base64') }}"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
></script>
```

## Performance & Replay Bundle

To use Sentry for error and performance monitoring, as well as for [Session Replay](../../session-replay), you can use the following bundle:

```html {tabTitle: CDN}
<script
  src="https://browser.sentry-cdn.com/{{ packages.version('sentry.javascript.browser') }}/bundle.tracing.replay.min.js"
  integrity="sha384-{{ packages.checksum('sentry.javascript.browser', 'bundle.tracing.replay.min.js', 'sha384-base64') }}"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
></script>
```

## Errors & Replay Bundle

To use Sentry for error monitoring, as well as for [Session Replay](../../session-replay), but **not for performance monitoring**, you can use the following bundle:

```html {tabTitle: CDN}
<script
  src="https://browser.sentry-cdn.com/{{ packages.version('sentry.javascript.browser') }}/bundle.replay.min.js"
  integrity="sha384-{{ packages.checksum('sentry.javascript.browser', 'bundle.replay.min.js', 'sha384-base64') }}"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
></script>
```

## Errors-only Bundle

If you only use Sentry for error monitoring, and don't need performance tracing or replay functionality, you can use the following bundle:

```html {tabTitle: CDN}
<script
  src="https://browser.sentry-cdn.com/{{ packages.version('sentry.javascript.browser') }}/bundle.min.js"
  integrity="sha384-{{ packages.checksum('sentry.javascript.browser', 'bundle.min.js', 'sha384-base64') }}"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
></script>
```

## Usage & Configuration

Once you've included the Sentry SDK bundle in your page, you can use Sentry in your own bundle:

```javascript {tabTitle: CDN}
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  // this assumes your build process replaces `process.env.npm_package_version` with a value
  release: "my-project-name@" + process.env.npm_package_version,
  integrations: [new Sentry.BrowserTracing()],

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

## Available Bundles

Our CDN hosts a variety of bundles:

- `@sentry/browser` with error monitoring only (named `bundle.<modifiers>.js`)
- `@sentry/browser` with error and performance monitoring (named `bundle.tracing.<modifiers>.js`)
- each of the integrations in `@sentry/integrations` (named `<integration-name>.<modifiers>.js`)

Each bundle is offered in both ES6 and ES5 versions, and for each version there are three bundle varieties: unminified, minified, and minified with debug logging. (That last version can be helpful for times when you need to debug an issue which only occurs in production. In a development environment, it makes most sense to use the unminified bundle, which always includes logging.)

For example:

- `bundle.js` is `@sentry/browser`, compiled to ES6 but not minified, with debug logging included (as it is for all unminified bundles)
- `rewriteframes.es5.min.js` is the `RewriteFrames` integration, compiled to ES5 and minified, with no debug logging
- `bundle.tracing.es5.debug.min.js` is `@sentry/browser` with performance monitoring enabled, compiled to ES5 and minified, with debug logging included

<Alert level="info" title="Updates to naming scheme in SDK version 7">

Version 7 of the Sentry JavaScript SDKs changed the bundles to be ES6 by default.
Previously, the default bundles were compiled to ES5. If you need to support ES5, see [Available Bundles](#available-bundles) or the [Migration Guide to Version 7](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/master/MIGRATION.md#upgrading-from-6x-to-7x).

## Additional Configuration

### Using defer

If you use the [`defer` script attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script#attr-defer), we strongly recommend that you place the script tag for the browser SDK first and mark all of your other scripts with `defer` (but not `async`). This will guarantee that that the Sentry SDK is executed before any of the others.

Without doing this you will find that it's possible for errors to occur before Sentry is loaded, which means you'll be flying blind to those issues.

### Content Security Policy

If you have a Content Security Policy (CSP) set up on your site, you will need to add the `script-src` of wherever you're loading the SDK from, and the origin of your DSN. For example:

- `script-src: https://browser.sentry-cdn.com`
- `connect-src: *.sentry.io`
