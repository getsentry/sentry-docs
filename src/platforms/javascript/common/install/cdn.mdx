Sentry supports loading its JavaScript SDK via a CDN. Generally we suggest using our npm package (`@sentry/browser`) as utilizing a CDN create scenarios where Sentry is unable to load due to networking issues or common extensions like ad blockers. If you _must_ use a CDN, take a look at [loading Sentry lazily with our JS loader](../lazy-load-sentry/).

```html {tabTitle: CDN}
<script
  src="https://browser.sentry-cdn.com/{{ packages.version('sentry.javascript.browser') }}/bundle.min.js"
  integrity="sha384-{{ packages.checksum('sentry.javascript.browser', 'bundle.min.js', 'sha384-base64') }}"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
></script>
```

## Performance Bundle

To use Sentry's performance tracing an alternative bundle is needed. This allows us to keep the filesize down for users who only need error monitoring.

```html {tabTitle: CDN}
<script
  src="https://browser.sentry-cdn.com/{{ packages.version('sentry.javascript.browser') }}/bundle.tracing.min.js"
  integrity="sha384-{{ packages.checksum('sentry.javascript.browser', 'bundle.tracing.min.js', 'sha384-base64') }}"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
></script>
```

<Note>

You only need to load `bundle.tracing.min.js`, which provides both error and performance monitoring. There is also an ES6 version of the tracing bundle, `bundle.tracing.es6.min.js`.

</Note>

The most important thing to note here is that `Sentry.Integrations` has been made available, and can be referenced in your call to `Sentry.init`:

```javascript {tabTitle: CDN}
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  // this assumes your build process sets "npm_package_version" in the env
  release: "my-project-name@" + process.env.npm_package_version,
  integrations: [new Sentry.BrowserTracing()],

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

## Available Bundles

Our CDN hosts a variety of bundles:

- `@sentry/browser` (named `bundle.<modifiers>.js`)
- `@sentry/browser` and `@sentry/tracing` together (named `bundle.tracing.<modifiers>.js`)
- each of the integrations in `@sentry/integrations` (named `<integration-name>.<modifiers>.js`)

Each bundle is offered in both ES5 and ES6 versions, and for each version there are three bundle varieties: unminified, minified, and minified with debug logging. (That last version can be helpful for times when you need to debug an issue which only occurs in prod. In dev, it makes most sense to use the unminified bundle, which always includes logging.)

So, for example, `bundle.tracing.es6.debug.min.js` is `@sentry/browser` and `@sentry/tracing` bundled together, compiled to ES6, and minified (but with debug logging included). On the simpler end of the naming spectrum, `bundle.js` is `@sentry/browser`, compiled to ES5 but not minified (with debug logging included, as it is for all unminified bundles).

## Additional Configuration

### Using defer

If you use the [`defer` script attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script#attr-defer), we strongly recommend that you place the script tag for the browser SDK first and mark all of your other scripts with `defer` (but not `async`). This will guarantee that that the Sentry SDK is executed before any of the others.

Without doing this you will find that it's possible for errors to occur before Sentry is loaded, which means you'll be flying blind to those issues.

### Content Security Policy

If you have a Content Security Policy (CSP) set up on your site, you will need to add the `script-src` of wherever you're loading the SDK from, and the origin of your DSN. For example:

- `script-src: https://browser.sentry-cdn.com`
- `connect-src: *.sentry.io`
