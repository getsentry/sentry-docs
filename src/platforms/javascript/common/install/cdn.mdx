Sentry supports loading it's JavaScript SDK via a CDN. Generally we suggest using our npm package (`@sentry/browser`) as utilizing a CDN create scenarios where Sentry is unable to load due to networking issues or common extensions like ad blockers. If you _must_ use a CDN, take a look at [loading Sentry lazily with our JS loader](../lazy-load-sentry/).

```html {tabTitle: CDN}
<script
  src="https://browser.sentry-cdn.com/{{ packages.version('sentry.javascript.browser') }}/bundle.min.js"
  integrity="sha384-{{ packages.checksum('sentry.javascript.browser', 'bundle.min.js', 'sha384-base64') }}"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
></script>
```

## Performance Bundle

To use Sentry's performance tracing an alternative bundle is needed. This allows us to keep the filesize down for users who only need error monitoring.

```html {tabTitle: CDN}
<script
  src="https://browser.sentry-cdn.com/{{ packages.version('sentry.javascript.browser') }}/bundle.tracing.min.js"
  integrity="sha384-{{ packages.checksum('sentry.javascript.browser', 'bundle.tracing.min.js', 'sha384-base64') }}"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
></script>
```

<Note>

You only need to load `bundle.tracing.min.js`, which provides both error and performance monitoring.

</Note>

The most important thing to note here is that `Sentry.Integrations` has been made available, and can be referenced in your call to `Sentry.init`:

```javascript {tabTitle: CDN}
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  release: "my-project-name@" + process.env.npm_package_version,
  integrations: [new Sentry.Integrations.BrowserTracing()],

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

## Available Bundles

A variety of bundles are provided which are optimized for Sentry's various integrations.

## Additional Configuration

### Using defer

If you include `defer` in your script your app, to make sure it can monitor everything that follows it. We strongly recommend that if you use `defer`, you both place the script tag for the browser SDK first and also mark it -- and all of your other scripts -- `defer` (but not `async`), guaranteeing that itâ€™s executed before any of the others.

Without doing this you will find that it's possible for errors to occur before Sentry is loaded, which means you'll be flying blind to those issues.

### Content Security Policy

If you have a Content Security Policy (CSP) set up on your site, you will need to add the `script-src` of wherever you're loading the SDK from, and the origin of your DSN. For example:

- `script-src: https://browser.sentry-cdn.com`
- `connect-src: *.sentry.io`
