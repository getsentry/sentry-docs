The Loader is a small script that takes care for you initializing the SDK for you, as well as keep it up-to-date. It is desgined as a drop in solution that you don't have to think about a lot.

## Using the Loader


To use the loader, go in the Sentry UI to _Settings -> Projects -> Client Keys (DSN)_, and then press the _Configure_ button. Copy the script tag from the _JavaScript Loader_ section, and include it as the first script on your page. (By including it first, you allow it to catch and buffer events from any subsequent scripts, while still ensuring the full SDK doesn't load until after everything else has run.)

```html
<script
  src="https://js.sentry-cdn.com/___PUBLIC_KEY___.min.js"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
></script>
```

By default, Performance Monitoring and Session Replay is enabled. 

## Loader Configuration

The loader has a few configuration options:

- What version of the SDK to load
- When to load the SDK
- Using Performance Monitoring
- Using Session Replay
- Serve a Debug Bundle

### SDK Version

To configure the version, use the dropdown in the _JavaScript Loader_ settings, directly beneath the script tag you copied earlier.

![JavaScript Loader Settings](js-loader-settings.png)

Note that because of caching, it can take a few minutes for version changes made here to take effect.

### Load Timing

By default, if you just use it for errors, the loader won't load the full SDK until triggered by one of the following:

- an unhandled error
- an unhandled promise rejection
- a call to `Sentry.captureMessage`
- a call to `Sentry.captureEvent`

Once one of those occurs, the loader will buffer that event and immediately request the full SDK from our CDN. Any events that occur between that request being made and the completion of SDK initialization will also be buffered, and all buffered events will be sent to Sentry once the SDK is fully initialized.

Alternatively, you can set the loader to request the full SDK earlier: still as part of page load, but _after_ all of the other JavaScript on the page has run. (In other words, in a subsequent event loop.) To do this, include `data-lazy="no"` in your script tag.

```html
<script
  src="https://js.sentry-cdn.com/___PUBLIC_KEY___.min.js"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
  data-lazy="no"
></script>
```

Finally, if you want to control the timing yourself, you can call `Sentry.forceLoad()`. You can do this as early as immediately after the loader runs (which has the same effect as setting `data-lazy="no"`) and as late as the first unhandled error, unhandled promise rejection, or call to `Sentry.captureMessage` or `Sentry.captureEvent` (which has the same effect as not calling it at all). Note that you can't delay loading past one of the aforementioned triggering events.

If you Performance Monitoring and/or Session Replay is enabled, we immediately need to fetch and initialize the full bundle to make sure we are able to capture transactions/replays when the page loaded.

## SDK Configuration

The loader script always includes a call to `Sentry.init` with one configuration option: your DSN. If you want to [configure your SDK](../../configuration/options/) beyond that, you'll need a second script tag, in which you'll call `Sentry.onLoad`. This script must come _after_ the main loader script.

```html
<script
  src="https://js.sentry-cdn.com/___PUBLIC_KEY___.min.js"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
></script>
<script>
  Sentry.onLoad(function() { ... });
</script>
```

`Sentry.onLoad` is a function that only the loader provides, and - as the name suggests - it sets a function to be run once the full SDK has been loaded. In that function, you can configure your SDK exactly the way you would were you using the CDN, with one difference: your `Sentry.init` call doesn't need to include your DSN, since it's already been set.

```html
<script>
  Sentry.onLoad(function() {
    Sentry.init({
      release: " ... ",
      environment: " ... "
    });
    Sentry.configureScope(scope => {
      scope.setTag( ... );
    });
    // etc.
  });
</script>
```

For Performance Monitoring, by default the SDK will be initialized with `traces_sample_rate: 1` and for Session Replay `replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1` and `replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0`. Put it words, we capture all pages with Performance Monitoring and Replays in 10% of error cases.

## **Limitations**

Because the loader injects the SDK asynchronously (only for errors), only _unhandled errors_ and _unhandled promise rejections_ will be caught and buffered before the SDK is fully loaded. Specifically, the capturing of any [breadcrumb data](../../enriching-events/breadcrumbs/) will not be available until the SDK is fully loaded and initialized. To reduce the amount of time these features are unavailable, set `data-lazy="no"` or call `forceLoad()` as described above.

If you want to understand the inner workings of the loader itself, you can read the documented source code in all its glory over at the [sentry-javascript repository](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/master/packages/browser/src/loader.js).



# CDN

import JsBundleList from "~src/components/jsBundleList";

Sentry supports loading the JavaScript SDK from a CDN. Generally we suggest using our Loader instead. If you _must_ use a CDN, take a look at [loading Sentry lazily with our JS loader](../lazy-load-sentry/), which provides a deferred version of our minified ES5 browser bundle. To see what other bundles are available, see [Available Bundles](#available-bundles) below.

## Default Bundle

To use Sentry for error and performance monitoring, you can use the following bundle:

```html {tabTitle: CDN}
<script
  src="https://browser.sentry-cdn.com/{{ packages.version('sentry.javascript.browser') }}/bundle.tracing.min.js"
  integrity="sha384-{{ packages.checksum('sentry.javascript.browser', 'bundle.tracing.min.js', 'sha384-base64') }}"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
></script>
```

## Performance & Replay Bundle

To use Sentry for error and performance monitoring, as well as for [Session Replay](../../session-replay), you can use the following bundle:

```html {tabTitle: CDN}
<script
  src="https://browser.sentry-cdn.com/{{ packages.version('sentry.javascript.browser') }}/bundle.tracing.replay.min.js"
  integrity="sha384-{{ packages.checksum('sentry.javascript.browser', 'bundle.tracing.replay.min.js', 'sha384-base64') }}"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
></script>
```

## Errors & Replay Bundle

To use Sentry for error monitoring, as well as for [Session Replay](../../session-replay), but **not for performance monitoring**, you can use the following bundle:

```html {tabTitle: CDN}
<script
  src="https://browser.sentry-cdn.com/{{ packages.version('sentry.javascript.browser') }}/bundle.replay.min.js"
  integrity="sha384-{{ packages.checksum('sentry.javascript.browser', 'bundle.replay.min.js', 'sha384-base64') }}"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
></script>
```

## Errors-only Bundle

If you only use Sentry for error monitoring, and don't need performance tracing or replay functionality, you can use the following bundle:

```html {tabTitle: CDN}
<script
  src="https://browser.sentry-cdn.com/{{ packages.version('sentry.javascript.browser') }}/bundle.min.js"
  integrity="sha384-{{ packages.checksum('sentry.javascript.browser', 'bundle.min.js', 'sha384-base64') }}"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
></script>
```

## Usage & Configuration

Once you've included the Sentry SDK bundle in your page, you can use Sentry in your own bundle:

```javascript {tabTitle: CDN}
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  // this assumes your build process replaces `process.env.npm_package_version` with a value
  release: "my-project-name@" + process.env.npm_package_version,
  integrations: [new Sentry.BrowserTracing()],

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

## Available Bundles

Our CDN hosts a variety of bundles:

- `@sentry/browser` with error monitoring only (named `bundle.<modifiers>.js`)
- `@sentry/browser` with error and performance monitoring (named `bundle.tracing.<modifiers>.js`)
- `@sentry/browser` with error and session replay (named `bundle.replay.<modifiers>.js`)
- `@sentry/browser` with error, performance monitoring and session replay (named `bundle.tracing.replay.<modifiers>.js`)
- each of the integrations in `@sentry/integrations` (named `<integration-name>.<modifiers>.js`)

Each bundle is offered in both ES6 and ES5 versions, and for each version there are three bundle varieties: unminified, minified, and minified with debug logging. (That last version can be helpful for times when you need to debug an issue which only occurs in production. In a development environment, it makes most sense to use the unminified bundle, which always includes logging.)

For example:

- `bundle.js` is `@sentry/browser`, compiled to ES6 but not minified, with debug logging included (as it is for all unminified bundles)
- `rewriteframes.es5.min.js` is the `RewriteFrames` integration, compiled to ES5 and minified, with no debug logging
- `bundle.tracing.es5.debug.min.js` is `@sentry/browser` with performance monitoring enabled, compiled to ES5 and minified, with debug logging included

<Alert level="info" title="Updates to naming scheme in SDK version 7">

Version 7 of the Sentry JavaScript SDKs changed the bundles to be ES6 by default.
Previously, the default bundles were compiled to ES5. If you need to support ES5, see [Available Bundles](#available-bundles) or the [Migration Guide to Version 7](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/master/MIGRATION.md#upgrading-from-6x-to-7x).

## Additional Configuration

### Using defer

If you use the [`defer` script attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script#attr-defer), we strongly recommend that you place the script tag for the browser SDK first and mark all of your other scripts with `defer` (but not `async`). This will guarantee that that the Sentry SDK is executed before any of the others.

Without doing this you will find that it's possible for errors to occur before Sentry is loaded, which means you'll be flying blind to those issues.

### Content Security Policy

If you have a Content Security Policy (CSP) set up on your site, you will need to add the `script-src` of wherever you're loading the SDK from, and the origin of your DSN. For example:

- `script-src: https://browser.sentry-cdn.com`
- `connect-src: *.sentry.io`
