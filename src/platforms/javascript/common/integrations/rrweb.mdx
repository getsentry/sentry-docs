This integration is still experimental.

</markdown></Alert>

Sentry provides a proof-of-concept integration with rrweb - a toolkit for recording and replaying user sessions. This can be extremely helpful when diagnosing complex user behavior in a rich Single Page Application.

<Note><markdown>

Replays utilize the [Attachments](../../enriching-events/attachments/), which are billed separately from errors.

</markdown></Note>

To get started you'll need to add the `@sentry/rrweb` and `rrweb` packages:

```javascript
npm install --save @sentry/rrweb rrweb
```

Next register the integration with the Sentry SDK. This will vary based on the framework you're using:

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";
import SentryRRWeb from "@sentry/rrweb";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    new SentryRRWeb({
      // ...options
    }),
  ],
  // ...
});
```

<Note><markdown>

For more information on configuration, see the [@sentry/rrweb project on GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-rrweb).

</markdown></Note>

Once a replay is captured with an event, you'll find it visible within Issue Details under the Replay section of the event.
