If you're using [`@nx/angular`](https://nx.dev/packages/angular), you can use the Nx CLI together with our Sentry webpack plugin to automatically create releases and upload source maps to Sentry when building your app (with `nx build`, for example).
Due to `@nx/angular`'s architecture, to register the webpack plugin, you'll first need to configure the [`@nx/angular:webpack-browser` executor](https://nx.dev/packages/angular/executors/webpack-browser).
In the end, you'll be able to automatically upload source maps whenever you're creating a production build of your app.

## Install

Install the Sentry webpack plugin:

```shell {tabTitle:npm}
npm install --save-dev @sentry/webpack-plugin
```

```shell {tabTitle:Yarn}
yarn add --dev  @sentry/webpack-plugin
```

## Configure

Configure your app to upload source maps in three steps.

### 1. Configure `project.json`

In your `project.json`, replace the default executor (`@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser`) with `@nx/angular:webpack-browser`:

```javascript {filename:project.json}
{
  "targets": {
    "build": {
      "builder": "@nx/angular:webpack-browser",
      "options": {
        "customWebpackConfig": {
          "path": "./webpack.config.js" // path to your webpack.config.js
        },
        "sourceMap": { // enable source maps generation
            "scripts": true,
         }
        // ... other options
      },
      // ... other options
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Register the Sentry Webpack Plugin

<Note>

This guide assumes you are using a Sentry SDK on version `7.47.0` or higher.

If you are on an older version and you want to upload source maps we recommend upgrading your SDK to the newest version.

</Note>

To upload source maps you have to configure an auth token.
Auth tokens can be passed to the plugin explicitly with the `authToken` option, with a `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable, or with a `.env.sentry-build-plugin` file in the working directory when building your project.
You likely want to add the auth token as an environment variable to your CI/CD environment.

<OrgAuthTokenNote />

```bash {filename:.env.sentry-build-plugin}
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=___ORG_AUTH_TOKEN___
```

Register the Sentry webpack plugin in your `webpack.config.js`:

<SignInNote />

```javascript {filename:webpack.config.js}
const { sentryWebpackPlugin } = require("@sentry/webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  // ... other config above ...

  devtool: "source-map", // Source map generation must be turned on
  plugins: [
    sentryWebpackPlugin({
      org: "___ORG_SLUG___",
      project: "___PROJECT_SLUG___",

      // Auth tokens can be obtained from
      // https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/settings/auth-tokens/
      authToken: process.env.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN,
    }),
  ],
};
```

Learn more about configuring the plugin in our [Sentry webpack plugin documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/webpack-plugin).

### 3. Upload

To upload the source maps, build your Angular application:

```bash
nx build
```

<Note>

The Sentry webpack plugin doesn't upload source maps in watch-mode/development-mode.
We recommend running a production build to test your implementation.
