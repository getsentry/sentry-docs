description: "Learn more about the Sentry SDK's automatic fetching of source code and source maps by scraping the URLs within the stack trace."
---

Sentry supports un-minifying JavaScript via source maps, which lets you view source code context obtained from stack traces in their original untransformed form. This is particularly useful for debugging minified code (for example, UglifyJS), or transpiled code from a higher-level language (such as TypeScript and ES6).

<Note><markdown>

When you're using the Sentry JavaScript SDK, the SDK automatically fetches the source code and source maps by scraping the URLs within the stack trace. However, you may have legitimate reasons for [disabling the JavaScript source fetching in Sentry](https://blog.sentry.io/2018/07/17/source-code-fetching).

## Capturing Source Maps

Most modern JavaScript transpilers support source maps. Below you'll find our recommended instructions, but we also provide instructions for various common tools:

- [Webpack](tools/webpack/)
- [TypeScript](tools/typescript/)
- [UglifyJS](tools/uglifyjs/)
- [SystemJS](tools/systemjs/)

<PlatformSection notSupported={["javascript.angular"]}><markdown>

We recommend using [Sentry's Webpack plugin](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-webpack-plugin) to configure source maps and upload them automatically during the build:

```shell {tabTitle:npm}
$ npm install --save-dev @sentry/webpack-plugin
```

```shell {tabTitle:yarn}
$ yarn add --dev @sentry/webpack-plugin
```

Next you need to generate an access token for our API. Within your organization's settings, navigate to Developer Settings, [create a new internal integration](https://docs.sentry.io/product/integrations/integration-platform/#internal-integrations), and provide a name appropriate to your organization. **Important:** Select **Releases -> Admin** for Permissions.

<Note><markdown>

The Releases -> Admin permission is also known as 'project:releases' in other API documentation.

</markdown></Note>

The package automatically installs [sentry-cli](/cli/configuration/), but you will still need ot export your authentication token::

```bash
export SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=your-auth-token
```

Then, add the plugin to your `webpack.config.js`:

```javascript {filename:webpack.config.js}
const SentryWebpackPlugin = require("@sentry/webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  // other configuration
  configureWebpack: {
    plugins: [
      new SentryWebpackPlugin({
        include: ".",
        ignoreFile: ".sentrycliignore",
        ignore: ["node_modules", "webpack.config.js"],
        configFile: "sentry.properties",
      }),
    ],
  },
};
```

In Vue 2.x, you should use `vue.config.js` instead of `webpack.config.js`, and use `include: "./dist"` instead of `include: "."`

</PlatformSection>

Additional information can be found in our [Webpack documentation](tools/webpack/).

<PlatformSection supported={["javascript.angular"]}><markdown>

SystemJS is the default module loader for Angular projects. The [SystemJS build tool](https://github.com/systemjs/builder) can be used to bundle, transpile, and minify source code for use in production environments, and can be configured to output source maps.

```javascript
builder.bundle("src/app.js", "dist/app.min.js", {
  minify: true,
  sourceMaps: true,
  sourceMapContents: true,
});
```

Additional information can be found in our [SystemJS documentation](tools/systemjs/).

From here, you can [upload your source maps](uploading/) to Sentry.
