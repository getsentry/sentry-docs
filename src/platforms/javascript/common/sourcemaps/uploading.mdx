title: Uploading Source Maps
---

We recommend uploading source maps as part of your build process, but you can also [serve them publicly alongside your source files](../hosting-publicly/).

<Note>

The recommended way to upload source maps is using [sentry-cli](/product/cli/). If you have used [_Sentry Wizard_](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-wizard) to set up your project, it has already created all necessary configuration to upload source maps. Otherwise, follow the [CLI configuration docs](/product/cli/configuration/) to set up your project.

</Note>

You need to set up your build system to create a release and attach the various source files. For Sentry to de-minify your stack traces, you must provide both the minified files (for example, `app.min.js`) and the corresponding source maps. If the source map files do not contain your original source code (`sourcesContent`), you must also provide the original source files. (Alternatively, sentry-cli will automatically embed the sources (if missing) into your source maps if you pass the `--rewrite` flag.

Sentry uses [**Releases**](/product/releases/) to match the correct source maps to your events. To create a new release, run the following command (for example, during publishing):

```bash
sentry-cli releases new <release_name>
```

<Note>

The release name must be **unique within your organization** and match the `release` option in your SDK initialization code. Then, use the `upload-sourcemaps` command to scan a folder for source maps, process them and upload them to Sentry.

</Note>

```bash
sentry-cli releases files <release_name> upload-sourcemaps /path/to/files
```

<Note>

You can find the artifacts uploaded to Sentry by navigating to **[Project] » Project Settings » Source Maps**.

</Note>

This command will upload all files ending in _.js_ and _.map_ to the specified release. If you wish to change these extensions – for example, to upload typescript sources – use the `--ext` option:

```bash
sentry-cli releases files <release_name> upload-sourcemaps --ext ts --ext map /path/to/files
```

Until now, the release is in a draft state (“_unreleased_”). Once all source maps have been uploaded, and your app has been published successfully, finalize the release with the following command:

```bash
sentry-cli releases finalize <release_name>
```

For convenience, you can alternatively pass the `--finalize` flag to the `new` command which will immediately finalize the release.

You don't _have_ to upload the source files (referenced by source maps), but without them, the grouping algorithm will not be as strong, and the UI will not show any contextual source.

For more information, see our [Releases API documentation](/api/releases/).

It’s not uncommon for a web application to be accessible at multiple origins. See our documentation on [multiple origins](../multiple-origins/) on how to handle this.
