UglifyJS is a popular tool for minifying your source code for production. It can dramatically reduce the size of your files by eliminating whitespace, rewriting variable names, removing dead code branches, and more.

<Note><markdown>

We strongly encourage you to use a higher level bundler (or transpiler) as UglifyJS configuration can get quite complicated to achieve the desired results.

</markdown></Note>

If you are using UglifyJS to minify your source code, the following command will additionally generate a source map that maps the minified code back to the original source:

```bash
uglifyjs app.js \
  -o app.min.js.map \
  --source-map url=app.min.js.map,includeSources
```
