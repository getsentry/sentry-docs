SystemJS is the default module loader for Angular 2 projects. The [SystemJS build tool](https://github.com/systemjs/builder) can be used to bundle, transpile, and minify source code for use in production environments, and can be configured to output source maps.

```javascript
builder.bundle("src/app.js", "dist/app.min.js", {
  minify: true,
  sourceMaps: true,
  sourceMapContents: true,
});
```

<Note>

The example configuration above will inline your original, un-transformed source code into the generated source map file. Sentry requires both source map(s) **and** your original source files to perform reverse transformations. If you choose NOT to inline your source files, you must make those source files available to Sentry in _addition_ to your source maps (see below).
