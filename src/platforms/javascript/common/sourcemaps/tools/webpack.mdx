Webpack is a powerful build tool that resolves, bundles, and compresses your JavaScript modules. It also supports various _loaders_ to transpile higher-level languages, reference stylesheets, or include static assets.

Sentry provides a convenient [Webpack plugin](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-webpack-plugin) that configures source maps and uploads them to Sentry during the build. This process is the recommended one for uploading sources to Sentry:

```shell {tabTitle:npm}
npm install --save-dev @sentry/webpack-plugin
```

```shell {tabTitle:yarn}
yarn add --dev @sentry/webpack-plugin
```

You may configure [sentry-cli](/product/cli/configuration/) through it's documented mechanisms, or instead simply bind required parameters when initializing the plugin:

```javascript {filename:webpack.config.js}
const SentryWebpackPlugin = require("@sentry/webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  // other configuration
  configureWebpack: {
    plugins: [
      new SentryWebpackPlugin({
        // sentry-cli configuration
        authToken: process.env.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN,
        org: "___ORG_SLUG___",
        project: "___PROJECT_SLUG___",

        // webpack specific configuration
        include: ".",
        ignore: ["node_modules", "webpack.config.js"],
      }),
    ],
  },
};
```

In Vue 2.x, you should use `vue.config.js` instead of `webpack.config.js`, and use `include: "./dist"` instead of `include: "."`

<Note><markdown>

Set up the `SentryWebpackPlugin` as the last running plugin, otherwise, the resulting source maps the plugin receives may not be the final one.

## Advanced Usage

If you prefer to upload source maps manually, configure Webpack to output source maps:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  output: {
    path: path.join(__dirname, "dist"),
    filename: "[name].js",
    sourceMapFilename: "[name].js.map",
  },
  // other configuration
};
```

If you use [SourceMapDevToolPlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/source-map-dev-tool-plugin) for more fine-grained control of source map generation, turn off `noSources` so Sentry can display proper source code context in event stack traces.

Additionally, the Webpack plugin will automatically set `window.SENTRY_RELEASE`, so your `Sentry.init` call will not need to be
