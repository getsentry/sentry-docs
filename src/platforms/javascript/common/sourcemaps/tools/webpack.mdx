Webpack is a powerful build tool that resolves, bundles, and compresses your JavaScript modules. It also supports various _loaders_ to transpile higher-level languages, reference stylesheets, or include static assets.

## Webpack Plugin

Sentry provides a convenient [Webpack plugin](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-webpack-plugin) that configures source maps and uploads them to Sentry during the build. This process is the recommended one for uploading sources to Sentry:

```shell {tabTitle:npm}
$ npm install --save-dev @sentry/webpack-plugin
```

```shell {tabTitle:yarn}
$ yarn add --dev @sentry/webpack-plugin
```

To allow the plugin to upload source maps automatically, create a `.sentryclirc` or configure environment variables as described in the [CLI configuration docs](/cli/configuration/). Then, add the plugin to your `webpack.config.js`:

```javascript
const SentryWebpackPlugin = require("@sentry/webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  // other configuration
  configureWebpack: {
    plugins: [
      new SentryWebpackPlugin({
        include: ".",
        ignoreFile: ".sentrycliignore",
        ignore: ["node_modules", "webpack.config.js"],
        configFile: "sentry.properties",
      }),
    ],
  },
};
```

In Vue 2.x, you should use `vue.config.js` instead of `webpack.config.js`, and use `include: "./dist"` instead of `include: "."`

</PlatformSection>

<Note><markdown>

Set up the `SentryWebpackPlugin` as the last running plugin, otherwise, the resulting source maps the plugin receives may not be the final one.

## Advanced Usage

If you prefer to upload source maps manually, configure Webpack to output source maps:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  output: {
    path: path.join(__dirname, "dist"),
    filename: "[name].js",
    sourceMapFilename: "[name].js.map",
  },
  // other configuration
};
```

If you use [SourceMapDevToolPlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/source-map-dev-tool-plugin) for more fine-grained control of source map generation, turn off `noSources` so Sentry can display proper source code context in event stack traces.

Additionally, the Webpack plugin will automatically set `window.SENTRY_RELEASE`, so your `Sentry.init` call will not need to be
