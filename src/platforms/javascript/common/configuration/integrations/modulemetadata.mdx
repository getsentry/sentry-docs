_Import name: `Sentry.Integrations.ModuleMetadata`_

Metadata can be injected by the Sentry bundler plugins using the `_experiments.moduleMetadata` config option.
When this integration is added, the metadata passed to the bundler plugin is added to the stack frames of all events
under the `module_metadata` property. This can be used to help in tagging or routing of events from different teams
