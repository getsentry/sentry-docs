_Import name: `Sentry.Integrations.InboundFilters`_

This integration allows you to ignore specific errors based on the type,
message, or URLs in a given exception.

By default, it'll ignore errors that start with `Script error` or `Javascript error: Script error`.

To configure this integration, use the `ignoreErrors`, `ignoreTransactions`, `denyUrls`,
and `allowUrls` SDK options directly. Keep in mind that `denyURLs` and `allowURLs`
only work for captured exceptions not raw message events.
