This integration extracts all non-native attributes from the error object and attaches them to the event as extra data. If the error object has a .toJSON() method, the ExtraErrorData integration will run it to extract additional information.

This integration requires you to install `@sentry/integrations` next to your main SDK package.

## Options

- `depth` (number)

Limit of how deep the object serializer should go. The default is 3. Anything deeper than the set limit will
be replaced with standard Node.js REPL notation of [Object], [Array], [Function], or
a primitive value.
