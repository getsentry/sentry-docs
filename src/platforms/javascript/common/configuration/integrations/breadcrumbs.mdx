_Import name: `Sentry.Integrations.Breadcrumbs`_

This integration is [enabled by default](./../#modifying-default-integrations).

This integration wraps native APIs to capture breadcrumbs. By default, the Sentry SDK wraps all APIs.
You can opt-out of capturing breadcrumbs for specific parts of your application (e.g. do not capture `console.log` calls as breadcrumbs) via the options below.

## Options

### `console`

_Type: `boolean`_

Log calls to `console.log`, `console.debug`, etc.

### `dom`

_Type: `boolean` | `{ serializeAttribute: string | string[] }`_

Log all click and keypress events.

When an object with a `serializeAttribute` key is provided, the Breadcrumbs integration will look for given attribute(s) in DOM elements while generating the breadcrumb trails. Matched elements will be followed by their custom attributes, instead of their `id`s or `class` names.

### `fetch`

_Type: `boolean`_

Log HTTP requests done with the Fetch API

### `history`

_Type: `boolean`_

Log calls to `history.pushState` and related APIs.

### `sentry`

_Type: `boolean`_

Log whenever we send an event to the server.

### `xhr`

_Type: `boolean`_

Log HTTP requests done with the XHR API.
