_Import name: `Sentry.Integrations.LinkedErrors`_

This integration allows you to configure linked errors. Theyâ€™ll be recursively read up to a specified limit, then lookup will be performed by a specific key. By default, the Sentry SDK sets the limit to five and the key used is `"cause"`.

## Options

- `key` (string)
- `limit` (number)

## Example

Here's a code example of how this could be implemented:

<PlatformContent includePath="configuration/linked-errors" />
