Sentry provides a number of integrations which are designed to add automatic instrumentation to your application. Some of these integrations are enabled by default, while others have to be explicitly enabled.

## Available Integrations

<PageGrid exclude={["custom"]} />

## Modifying Default Integrations

To disable system integrations, set `defaultIntegrations: false` when calling `init()`.

To override their settings, provide a new instance with your config to the `integrations` option. For example, to turn off browser capturing console calls:

<SignInNote />

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  integrations: [
    new Sentry.Integrations.Breadcrumbs({
      console: false,
    }),
  ],
});
```

## Adding an Integration

You can add additional integrations in your `init` call:

<PlatformContent includePath="configuration/enable-pluggable-integrations" />

Alternatively, you can add integrations lazily via `client.addIntegration()`.
This is useful if you only want to enable an integration in a specific environment or if you want to lazy-load an integration.
For all other cases, we recommend you use the `integrations` option.

<PlatformContent includePath="configuration/enable-pluggable-integrations-lazy" />

## Removing an Integration

This example removes the integration for adding breadcrumbs to the event, which is enabled by default:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  // ...
  integrations: function (integrations) {
    // integrations will be all default integrations
    return integrations.filter(function (integration) {
      return integration.name !== "Breadcrumbs";
    });
  },
});
```

## Custom Integrations

You can also create [custom integrations](./custom).
