In addition to the integrations that come with the SDK and which can be found on `Sentry.Integrations`,
you can also write custom integrations.

Custom integration must conform to the [Integration interface](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/master/packages/types/src/integration.ts).
