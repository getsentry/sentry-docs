This integration allows you to inspect the contents of a processed event and hint object that gets passed to `beforeSend` or `beforeSendTransaction`. It will always run as the last integration, no matter when it was registered.

Note that this is different than setting `debug: true` (which will enable debug logging in the console) in your Sentry.init options.

This integration requires you to install `@sentry/integrations` next to your main SDK package.

## Options

### `debugger`

_Type: `boolean`_

Trigger DevTools debugger instead of using `console.log`.

### `stringify`

_Type: `boolean`_

Stringify event before passing it to `console.log`.
