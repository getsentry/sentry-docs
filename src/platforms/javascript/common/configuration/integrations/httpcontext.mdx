_Import name: `Sentry.Integrations.HttpContext`_

This integration is [enabled by default](./../#modifying-default-integrations).

This integration attaches HTTP request information, such as URL, user-agent, referrer, and other headers, to the event.
It allows us to correctly catalog and tag events with specific OS, browser, and version information.
