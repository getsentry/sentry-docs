_Import name: `Sentry.Integrations.ContextLines`_

This integration adds source code from inline JavaScript of the current page's HTML (e.g. JS in `<script>` tags) to stack traces of captured errors.
It _can't_ collect source code from assets referenced by your HTML (e.g. `<script src="..." />`).

The `ContextLines` integration is useful when you have inline JS code in HTML pages that can't be accessed by Sentry's backend, for example, due to a login-protected page.

This integration requires you to install `@sentry/integrations` next to your main SDK package.
