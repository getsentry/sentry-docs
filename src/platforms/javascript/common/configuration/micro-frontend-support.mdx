The recommended way to use the Sentry SDK with Micro Frontend is to set up a multiplexed transport when calling `Sentry.init`. The multiplexed transport will send events to different Sentry projects based on the attributes on that event, which is how you can isolate events from a specific micro-frontend to a specific Sentry project.

Requires SDK version `7.50.0` or higher.

The example below uses the `feature` tag to determine which Sentry project to send the event to by using different DSNs. If the event does not have a `feature` tag, we send it to the fallback DSN defined in `Sentry.init`.

```typescript
import { makeMultiplexedTransport } from '@sentry/core';
import { init, captureException, makeFetchTransport } from '@sentry/browser';

function dsnFromFeature({ getEvent }) {
  const event = getEvent();
  switch(event?.tags?.feature) {
    case 'cart':
      return ['__CART_DSN__'];
    case 'gallery':
      return ['__GALLERY_DSN__'];
  }
  return []
}

init({
  dsn: '__FALLBACK_DSN__',
  transport: makeMultiplexedTransport(makeFetchTransport, dsnFromFeature)
});

captureException(new Error('oh no!', scope => {
  scope.addTag('feature', 'cart');
  return scope;
});
```

You can then set tags/contexts on events in individual micro-frontends to decide which Sentry project to send the event to.

<Alert level="warning" title="Note">

Currently, there is no way to isolate tags/contexts/breadcrumbs/spans to events sent to a specific Sentry project. This is because browsers do not have support for async contexts, which is required for this functionality to work. Once the [tc39 Async Context](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-async-context) proposal is implemented in all browsers, we will be able to add this functionality.

## `makeMultiplexedTransport` API

`makeMultiplexedTransport` takes an instance of a transport (we recommend `makeFetchTransport`) and a matcher function that returns an array of DSNs.

```typescript
type EnvelopeItemType =
  | 'client_report'
  | 'user_report'
  | 'session'
  | 'sessions'
  | 'transaction'
  | 'attachment'
  | 'event'
  | 'profile'
  | 'replay_event'
  | 'replay_recording'
  | 'check_in';

interface MatchParam {
  /** The envelope to be sent */
  envelope: Envelope;
  /**
   * A function that returns an event from the envelope if one exists. You can optionally pass an array of envelope item
   * types to filter by - only envelopes matching the given types will be multiplexed.
   *
   * @param types Defaults to ['event'] (only error events will be matched)
   */
  getEvent(types?: EnvelopeItemType[]): Event | undefined;
}

type Matcher = (param: MatchParam) => string[];

declare function makeMultiplexedTransport(
  transport: (options: TransportOptions) => Transport,
  matcher: Matcher
): (options: TransportOptions) => Transport;
```

The matcher function runs after all client processing (`beforeSend` option, event processors from integrations).

## Examples

### Allowing Individual Micro Frontends to Add Their Own DSNs

The example below gives a list of DSNs and tags. It uses the `tags` attribute on the event to determine which Sentry project to send the event to by using different DSNs. If the event does not have a `tags` attribute, we send it to the fallback DSN defined in `Sentry.init`. Individual micro-frontends can then mutate the `myDsns` variable to add their own DSNs and tags.

```typescript
const myDsns = [
  { dsn: 'https://...', tag: 'my-tag' },
  { dsn: 'https://...', tag: 'other-tag' },
];

function dsnFromTag({ getEvent }) {
  const event = getEvent();
  const opt = myDsns.find(({tag} => event?.tags?.includes(tag));
  return opt ? [opt.dsn] : [];
}

init({
  dsn: '__FALLBACK_DSN__',
  transport: makeMultiplexedTransport(makeFetchTransport, dsnFromTag)
});
```

### Sending the Same Event to Multiple DSNs

Since the matcher returns an array, you can enforce that an event is sent to multiple DSNs.

```typescript
import {makeMultiplexedTransport} from '@sentry/core';
import {init, makeFetchTransport} from '@sentry/browser';

const DSN1 = '__DSN1__';
const DSN2 = '__DSN2__';

init({
  dsn: DSN1, // <- init dsn never gets used but need to be valid
  transport: makeMultiplexedTransport(makeFetchTransport, () => [DSN1, DSN2]),
});
```
