If your frontend includes JavaScript bundles from multiple sources with
differing release cycles, you may want to identify these or route events to
those specific projects.

The Sentry JavaScript SDKs have a number of tools to help support micro
frontends and module federation.

<Alert level="warning" title="Note">

Currently, there's no way to isolate tags/contexts/breadcrumbs/spans to events sent to a specific Sentry project. This is because browsers do not have support for async contexts, which is required for this functionality to work. Once the [tc39 Async Context](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-async-context) proposal is implemented in all browsers, we will be able to add this functionality.
