Sentry ships with code that enables you to debug your Sentry configuration, primarily through logging. While this code can be very useful in development environments, it's not typically necessary to include it in your production bundles where it takes up valuable space. The JavaScript SDK includes a special flag in its CommonJS and ESM distributions which can be used to facilitate [tree shaking](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Tree_shaking) (removal) of such code during the build process.

To make debugging code eligible for tree shaking, you must replace the `__SENTRY_DEBUG__` flag in the Sentry SDK with `false`.

## Tree Shaking Debug Code With Webpack

To tree shake Sentry debug code in your webpack bundles, we recommend using webpack's [DefinePlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/define-plugin/).

```javascript {filename:webpack.config.js}
const webpack = require("webpack");

module.exports = {
  // ... other options
  plugins: [
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      __SENTRY_DEBUG__: false,
    }),
    // ... other plugins
  ],
};
```

## Tree Shaking Debug Code With Rollup

If you're using `rollup.js`, we recommend using [Rollup's `replace` plugin](https://github.com/rollup/plugins/tree/master/packages/replace).

```javascript {filename:rollup.config.js}
import replace from "@rollup/plugin-replace";
import { terser } from "rollup-plugin-terser";

export default {
  // ... other options
  treeshake: "smallest", // recommended for best tree shaking results
  plugins: [
    replace({
      __SENTRY_DEBUG__: false,
    }),
    // ... other plugins (best placed after)
  ],
};
```

## Tree Shaking Debug Code With Next.js

To tree shake Sentry debug code in Next.js projects, you can use webpack's [DefinePlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/define-plugin/) in your Next.js configuration.

```javascript {filename:next.config.js}
const nextConfig = {
  webpack: (config, { webpack }) => {
    config.plugins.push(
      new webpack.DefinePlugin({
        __SENTRY_DEBUG__: false,
      })
    );

    // return the modified config
    return config;
  },
};
```

For more information on custom webpack configurations in Next.js, see [Custom Webpack Config](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/custom-webpack-config) in the Next.js docs.
