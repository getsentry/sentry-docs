Sentry's Browser SDK provides partial support for [Web Workers API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API), without needing extra configuration. To capture unhandled errors from web workers:

Install `@sentry/browser` using `yarn` or `npm`:

```bash
# Using yarn
yarn add @sentry/browser

# Using npm
npm install --save @sentry/browser
```

Then you can use it:

```javascript {filename:index.js}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
});

const worker = new Worker("worker.js");

// Unhandled errors from `onmessage` callback of `worker.js`
// will be captured.
worker.postMessage("Hello!");
```

<Alert level="warning" title="Manual Capturing">

Capturing errors or messages manually inside web workers is not yet supported. As a result, using `captureMessage` or `captureError` inside a web worker will fail silently. Only unhandled errors are captured and sent to Sentry.

</Alert>

```javascript {filename:worker.js}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";

self.onmessage = message => {
  // This won`t work.
  Sentry.captureMessage("Message received");

  // This will be captured.
  throw new Error();
};
```

### Source Maps

Sentry's source maps integration is supported inside web workers, if provided. Learn more about providing your [source maps](/platforms/javascript/sourcemaps/) to Sentry.
