description: "Learn more about the Sentry SDK's automatic fetching of source code and source maps by scraping the URLs within the stack trace."
---

Sentry supports un-minifying JavaScript via source maps, which lets you view source code context obtained from stack traces in their original untransformed form. This is particularly useful for debugging minified code (for example, UglifyJS), or transpiled code from a higher-level language (such as TypeScript and ES6).

<Note><markdown>

When you're using the Sentry JavaScript SDK, the SDK automatically fetches the source code and source maps by scraping the URLs within the stack trace. However, you may have legitimate reasons for [disabling the JavaScript source fetching in Sentry](https://blog.sentry.io/2018/07/17/source-code-fetching).

</markdown></Note>

## Generating Source Maps

Most modern JavaScript transpilers support source maps. Below you'll find our recommended instructions, but we also provide instructions for other common tools:

- [Webpack](tools/webpack/)
- [TypeScript](tools/typescript/)
- [UglifyJS](tools/uglifyjs/)
- [SystemJS](tools/systemjs/)

<PlatformSection notSupported={["javascript.angular"]}><markdown>

We recommend using [Sentry's Webpack plugin](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-webpack-plugin) to configure source maps and upload them automatically during the build:

```shell {tabTitle:npm}
$ npm install --save-dev @sentry/webpack-plugin
```

```shell {tabTitle:yarn}
$ yarn add --dev @sentry/webpack-plugin
```

To allow the plugin to upload source maps automatically, create a `.sentryclirc` or configure environment variables as described in the [CLI configuration docs](/cli/configuration/). Then, add the plugin to your `webpack.config.js`:

```javascript {filename:webpack.config.js}
const SentryWebpackPlugin = require("@sentry/webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  // other configuration
  configureWebpack: {
    plugins: [
      new SentryWebpackPlugin({
        include: ".",
        ignoreFile: ".sentrycliignore",
        ignore: ["node_modules", "webpack.config.js"],
        configFile: "sentry.properties",
      }),
    ],
  },
};
```

<PlatformSection supported={["javascript.vue"]}>

In Vue 2.x, you should use `vue.config.js` instead of `webpack.config.js`, and use `include: "./dist"` instead of `include: "."`

</PlatformSection>

Additional information can be found in our [Webpack documentation](tools/webpack/).

<PlatformSection supported={["javascript.angular"]}><markdown>

SystemJS is the default module loader for Angular projects. The [SystemJS build tool](https://github.com/systemjs/builder) can be used to bundle, transpile, and minify source code for use in production environments, and can be configured to output source maps.

```javascript
builder.bundle("src/app.js", "dist/app.min.js", {
  minify: true,
  sourceMaps: true,
  sourceMapContents: true,
});
```

Additional information can be found in our [SystemJS documentation](tools/systemjs/).

## Uploading Source Maps

Sentry needs access to your source maps to effectively fingerprint errors (via source code context expansion).

We recommend uploading source maps as part of your build process, but you can also [serve them publicly alongside your source files](hosting-publicly/).

<Note><markdown>

If you are not using [Sentry's Webpack plugin](tools/webpack/), the recommended way to upload source maps is using [Sentry CLI](/cli/). If you have used [_Sentry Wizard_](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-wizard) to set up your project, it has already created all necessary configuration to upload source maps. Otherwise, follow the [CLI configuration docs](/cli/configuration/) to set up your project.

</markdown></Note>

You need to set up your build system to create a release and attach the various source files. For Sentry to de-minify your stack traces, you must provide both the minified files (for example, `app.min.js`) and the corresponding source maps. If the source map files do not contain your original source code (`sourcesContent`), you must also provide the original source files. (Alternatively, sentry-cli will automatically embed the sources (if missing) into your source maps if you pass the `--rewrite` flag.

Sentry uses [**Releases**](/workflow/releases/) to match the correct source maps to your events. To create a new release, run the following command (for example, during publishing):

```bash
$ sentry-cli releases new <release_name>
```

<Note><markdown>

The release name must be **unique within your organization** and match the `release` option in your SDK initialization code. Then, use the `upload-sourcemaps` command to scan a folder for source maps, process them and upload them to Sentry.

</markdown></Note>

```bash
$ sentry-cli releases files <release_name> upload-sourcemaps /path/to/files
```

<Note><markdown>

You can find the artifacts uploaded to Sentry by navigating to **[Project] » Project Settings » Source Maps**.

</markdown></Note>

This command will upload all files ending in _.js_ and _.map_ to the specified release. If you wish to change these extensions – for example, to upload typescript sources – use the `--ext` option:

```bash
$ sentry-cli releases files <release_name> upload-sourcemaps --ext ts --ext map /path/to/files
```

Until now, the release is in a draft state (“_unreleased_”). Once all source maps have been uploaded, and your app has been published successfully, finalize the release with the following command:

```bash
$ sentry-cli releases finalize <release_name>
```

For convenience, you can alternatively pass the `--finalize` flag to the `new` command which will immediately finalize the release.

You don't _have_ to upload the source files (referenced by source maps), but without them, the grouping algorithm will not be as strong, and the UI will not show any contextual source.

For more information, see our [Releases API documentation](/api/releases/).

It’s not uncommon for a web application to be accessible at multiple origins. See our documentation on [multiple origins](multiple-origins/) on how to handle this.
