On this page, we provide installation and configuration information for those using a content delivery network (CDN).

If you don't already have an account and Sentry project established, head over to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/signup/), then return to this page.

## CDN Installation

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your application’s runtime. Add the Sentry SDK to your application:

```html {tabTitle: CDN}
<script
  src="https://browser.sentry-cdn.com/{{ packages.version('sentry.javascript.browser') }}/bundle.min.js"
  integrity="sha384-{{ packages.checksum('sentry.javascript.browser', 'bundle.min.js', 'sha384-base64') }}"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
></script>
```

Using `defer`

If you include `defer` in your script your app, to make sure it can monitor everything that follows it. We strongly recommend that if you use `defer`, you both place the script tag for the browser SDK first and also mark it -- and all of your other scripts -- `defer` (but not `async`), guaranteeing that it’s executed before any of the others.

</Alert>

**Note:** If you have a Content Security Policy (CSP) set up on your site, you will need to add the `script-src` of wherever you're loading the SDK from, and the origin of your DSN. For example:

- `script-src: https://browser.sentry-cdn.com`
- `connect-src: *.sentry.io`

Return now to the [Getting Started](/platforms/javascript/) for our JavaScript SDK to learn about how you can:
- Capture Errors
- Automatically Enrich Error Data
- Set the Release Version
- Upload Source Maps

## Monitor Performance

Performance Monitoring helps you see everything from macro-level metrics to micro-level spans, and you’ll be able to cross-reference transactions with related issues, customize queries based on your personal needs, and substantially more.

To get started with performance monitoring using Sentry’s JavaScript SDK, install both the `@sentry/browser` and `@sentry/tracing` packages, or link directly to our combined minified bundle via CDN:

<Alert level="note" title="Note"><markdown>

We switched our package name from `@sentry/apm` to `@sentry/tracing`. If you were previously using `@sentry/apm`, please see [Switching to @sentry/tracing](/product/performance/apm-to-tracing/).

</markdown></Alert>

```html {tabTitle: CDN}
<script
  src="https://browser.sentry-cdn.com/{{ packages.version('sentry.javascript.browser') }}/bundle.tracing.min.js"
  integrity="sha384-{{ packages.checksum('sentry.javascript.browser', 'bundle.tracing.min.js', 'sha384-base64') }}"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
></script>
```

Next, initialize the integration in your call to `Sentry.init`:

```javascript {tabTitle: CDN}
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  release: "my-project-name@" + process.env.npm_package_version,
  integrations: [new Sentry.Integrations.BrowserTracing()],
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0, // Be sure to lower this in production
});
```

Performance data is transmitted using a new event type called “transactions,” which you can learn about in [Distributed Tracing](/product/performance/distributed-tracing). To capture transactions, you must install the performance package and configure your SDK to set the `tracesSampleRate` option to a nonzero value. The example configuration above will transmit 100% of captured transactions; lower this value in production to avoid consuming your quota too quickly.
