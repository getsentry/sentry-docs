The JavaScript SDK uses a `transport` to send events to Sentry. On modern
browsers, the default transport uses the browsers `fetch` API to send events.

The default transports drop events if they fail to send due to a lack of connection.

### Offline Caching

If your JavaScript application is designed to continue working offline,
dropping events when no connection is available could mean you are missing
events that occur in that mode.

To enable offline caching of events, `makeBrowserOfflineTransport` can be used
to wrap existing transports and queue events using the browsers IndexedDB storage.
Sending of events is then retried later.

<PlatformContent includePath="configuration/offline" />

This adds a number of optional properties to `transportOptions`:

```javascript
transportOptions:{
  /**
   * Name of IndexedDb database to store events
   * Default: 'sentry-offline'
   */
  dbName: string;
  /**
   * Name of IndexedDb object store to store events
   * Default: 'queue'
   */
  storeName: string;
  /**
   * Maximum number of events to store
   * Default: 30
   */
  maxQueueSize: number;
  /**
   * Flush the store shortly after startup.
   * Default: false
   */
  flushAtStartup: boolean;
  /**
   * Called before an event is stored.
   * Return false to drop the envelope rather than store it.
   *
   * @param envelope The envelope that failed to send.
   * @param error The error that occurred.
   * @param retryDelay The current retry delay in milliseconds.
   */
  shouldStore: (envelope: Envelope, error: Error, retryDelay: number) => boolean | Promise<boolean>;
}
```

#### Browser Support

Offline caching is not supported in IE due to a lack of IndexedDB features.
