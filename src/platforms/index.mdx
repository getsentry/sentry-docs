To report to Sentry you’ll need to use a language-specific SDK. The Sentry team builds and maintains these for most popular languages, but there’s also a large ecosystem supported by the community.

If your use-case is very specific, or not covered by Sentry, you'll find documentation on how to report events on your own using our [_SDK API_](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/overview/).

<Note>

It is bad practice to use Sentry SDKs in third-party plugins, packages, and libraries (such as payment SDKs or embeddable widgets) meant to be consumed by other apps. If an app uses a Sentry SDK, as well as a third-party package with its own Sentry SDK installed, then the following issues can occur:

- Version conflicts may occur if multiple Sentry SDKs are installed in the same application.
- [Signal handlers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_signal_handling) may overwrite each other, leading to one of the Sentry SDKs operating incorrectly.
- Third-party SDKs and libraries may leak users' PII data to the third-party's Sentry organization.

## Community Supported

These SDKs are maintained and supported by [the Sentry community](https://open.sentry.io/). While generally our community does a great job at responding to issues, it's important to understand that Sentry staff cannot help you with issues using a community-supported SDK.

## Other platforms

Your favorite language or framework still cannot be found? Then we encourage you to consider [writing your own SDK](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/).
