To report to Sentry you’ll need to use a language-specific SDK. The Sentry team builds and maintains these for most popular languages, but there’s also a large ecosystem supported by the community.

If your use-case is very specific, or not covered by Sentry, you'll find documentation on how to report events on your own using our [_SDK API_](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/overview/).

## Platforms

<PlatformGrid />

## Community Supported

These SDKs are maintained and supported by [the Sentry community](https://forum.sentry.io). While generally our community does a great job at responding to issues, it's important to understand that Sentry staff cannot help you with issues using a community-supported SDK

## Other platforms

Some platforms have been phased out or have been replaced with new SDKs. For those legacy integrations head over to the [legacy clients](/clients/) page.

Your favorite language or framework still cannot be found? Then we encourage you to start a discussion about supporting it on our [community forum](https://forum.sentry.io).
