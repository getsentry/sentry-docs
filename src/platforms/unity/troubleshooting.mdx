## Installation Issues

### Sentry.h not found

The release 0.6.1 is missing the native libraries needed to build for iOS. This issue was resolved [with version 0.6.2](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-unity/blob/3053eafa333288a4bc9d101ee46db8f1473a7652/CHANGELOG.md#062).

### Package Manager - `Cannot perform upm operation: Unable to add package`

Confirm the URL doesn't have a trailing whitespace at the end. The Unity Package Manager will fail to find the package if a trailing whitespace is appended.

### Package Manager - `'HEAD': cannot update ref 'refs/heads/master'`

Some Unity versions, such as `2019.4.24f1` and `2020.3.2f1`, have a bug on UPM and fail to install with the error `'HEAD': cannot update ref 'refs/heads/master'`.
Unity has resolved this issue on newer releases. Learn more by checking the [Unity Issue Tracker](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/package-resolution-error-when-using-a-git-dependency-referencing-an-annotated-tag-in-its-git-url).

### PrecompiledAssemblyException: `Multiple precompiled assemblies with the same name`

The Sentry UPM package includes multiple DLLs within it. One or more of those DLLs might have already been provided by other packages. [Unity's package manager does not resolve](https://forum.unity.com/threads/dll-conflicts-in-two-upm-package.1084307/#post-7038340) those dependency conflicts which means it has to be resolved manually:

1. Choose which DLL you want to remove.
2. [Embed the package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-embed.html#embed-create) so you can modify it. This means you copy the package from Unity's global cache into your project's package directory and it should be version controlled.
3. Remove the conflicting DLL.

The name of the conflicting DLL is provided through the `PrecompiledAssemblyException` entry in the editor console.

#### Background information

Sentry SDK for Unity targets [.NET Standard 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard#net-implementation-support). It's based on the Sentry SDK for [.NET which supports many versions of .NET and Mono](/platforms/dotnet/compatibility/). Starting from **.NET 5.0** the .NET SDK has no dependencies.
[Unity has announced its intention to support .NET 6](https://forum.unity.com/threads/unity-future-net-development-status.1092205/):
> We would like to have something out in a preview in the fall of 2021 to coincide with .NET 6 release from Microsoft.

With this release, Sentry's SDK for Unity will have no dependencies to any external DLLs and such DLL conflict issues that UPM is unable to handle will no longer be something you need to deal with when using Sentry for Unity.


## Build Issues

### Target Integrity - `Building for iOS Simulator, but the linked and embedded framework 'Sentry.framework' was built for iOS.`

Our Unity SDK currently supports native iOS when building for device only. Support for the iOS simulators is planned.

## Runtime issues

### Library not loaded: @rpath/Sentry.framework/Sentry

If you encounter the following error:

```
2021-10-29 15:21:40.011452-0400 MyApp[2180:186329] Error loading /var/containers/Bundle/Application/88CC4619-7C5D-4BB1-9F4B-5AAD7EC4BF9C/MyApp.app/Frameworks/UnityFramework.framework/UnityFramework:  dlopen(/var/containers/Bundle/Application/88CC4619-7C5D-4BB1-9F4B-5AAD7EC4BF9C/MyApp.app/Frameworks/UnityFramework.framework/UnityFramework, 265): Library not loaded: @rpath/Sentry.framework/Sentry
  Referenced from: /private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/88CC4619-7C5D-4BB1-9F4B-5AAD7EC4BF9C/MyApp.app/Frameworks/UnityFramework.framework/UnityFramework
  Reason: image not found
```

This can happen if you've copied some of the SDK files directly to the Assets folder and the `Sentry.Unity.Editor.iOS.dll` which runs when you build an iOS player wasn't able to copy the `Sentry.framework` to the final app. Enabling debug mode in the Sentry editor window would display more information in the Unity console.

You can resolve this issue by installing the SDK with UPM.
