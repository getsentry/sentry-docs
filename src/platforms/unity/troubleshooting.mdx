## Installation Issues

### Sentry.h not found

The release 0.6.1 is missing the native libraries needed to build for iOS. This issue was resolved [with version 0.6.2](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-unity/blob/3053eafa333288a4bc9d101ee46db8f1473a7652/CHANGELOG.md#062).

### Package Manager - `Cannot perform upm operation: Unable to add package`

If you encounter the following error:

```
[Package Manager Window] Unable to add package [https://github.com/getsentry/unity.git#0.9.1 ]:
  Error when executing git command. fatal: invalid refspec '0.9.1 '
```

Confirm the URL doesn't have a trailing whitespace between the URL. The Unity Package Manager will fail to find the package if a trailing whitespace is appended.

### Package Manager - `'HEAD': cannot update ref 'refs/heads/master'`

Some Unity versions, such as `2019.4.24f1` and `2020.3.2f1`, have a bug on UPM and fail to install with the error `'HEAD': cannot update ref 'refs/heads/master'`.
Unity has resolved this issue on newer releases. Learn more by checking the [Unity Issue Tracker](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/package-resolution-error-when-using-a-git-dependency-referencing-an-annotated-tag-in-its-git-url).

### PrecompiledAssemblyException: `Multiple precompiled assemblies with the same name`

This issue was resolved in the release 0.7.0 of the Sentry SDK for Unity.
If you're still encountering this issue on a version later than 0.7.0, please let us know [with an issue report](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-unity/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=BUG_REPORT.md).

## Build Issues

### Target Integrity - `Building for iOS Simulator, but the linked and embedded framework 'Sentry.framework' was built for iOS.`

Our Unity SDK currently supports native iOS when building for device only. Support for the iOS simulators is planned.

## Runtime issues

### Library not loaded: @rpath/Sentry.framework/Sentry

If you encounter the following error:

```
2021-10-29 15:21:40.011452-0400 MyApp[2180:186329] Error loading /var/containers/Bundle/Application/88CC4619-7C5D-4BB1-9F4B-5AAD7EC4BF9C/MyApp.app/Frameworks/UnityFramework.framework/UnityFramework:  dlopen(/var/containers/Bundle/Application/88CC4619-7C5D-4BB1-9F4B-5AAD7EC4BF9C/MyApp.app/Frameworks/UnityFramework.framework/UnityFramework, 265): Library not loaded: @rpath/Sentry.framework/Sentry
  Referenced from: /private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/88CC4619-7C5D-4BB1-9F4B-5AAD7EC4BF9C/MyApp.app/Frameworks/UnityFramework.framework/UnityFramework
  Reason: image not found
```

This can happen if you've copied some of the SDK files directly to the Assets folder and the `Sentry.Unity.Editor.iOS.dll` which runs when you build an iOS player wasn't able to copy the `Sentry.framework` to the final app. Enabling debug mode in the Sentry editor window would display more information in the Unity console.

You can resolve this issue by installing the SDK with UPM.

## Events Not Sent

### Universal Windows Platform

In order to send events to Sentry, you will need to activate the InternetClient Capability in your Player Settings.
