Currently, the Unity SDK offers native support for Android, iOS, and Windows. The support is set to `enabled` by default and you can opt out for each platform individually in the configuration window.

<Note>

The setup for the iOS and Android native SDKs happens during build time, with the options defined in the Sentry editor configuration window. Changes to the options object done through [ScriptableOptionsConfiguration](/platforms/unity/configuration/options/) will not affect events from the native layer.

</Note>

## Android

When chosing Android as a build target, Unity creates a Gradle project. During the Unity build process, the SDK embeds the [Android SDK](/platforms/android/), as well as the provided options, by adding it to the generated project's Android Manifest.

## iOS

When building your game for iOS, Unity exports it as an Xcode project. By modifying that generated project, the SDK adds the [iOS SDK](/platforms/apple/guides/ios/) to provide native support. It adds the initialization code to the `main.m` and generates the options provided by the editor configuration window as `SentryOptions.m`. The SDK also copies the `SentryNativeBridge` that enables the C# layer to communicate with the iOS SDK. This means that there's no need to use the Unity [built-in crash reporting](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/CrashReport.html) functionality.

The [iOS SDK](/platforms/apple/guides/ios/) supports capturing **Objective-C Exceptions** which are disabled in the generated Xcode project by default. Consider enabling them in the **Build Settings** by setting `GCC_ENABLE_OBJC_EXCEPTIONS` to true.

## Windows

Windows native crashes are automatically captured through minidumps. The Native Support gets configured and enabled as early as possible by the C# layer, right after Unity engine starts. This is slightly different than the Android and iOS support where we inject native initialization code that runs before Unity engine runs.

## Debug Symbols

Sentry requires [debug information files](/platforms/android/data-management/debug-files/) to symbolicate your crash logs. The Unity SDK provides an automated upload functionality for those symbol files that rely on the [sentry-cli](/product/cli/). We've included the executables for Windows, macOS, and Linux inside the Unity SDK package.

The automated debug symbols upload is enabled by default but requires configuration. Go to **Tools > Sentry > Editor** to enter the [Auth Token](https://sentry.io/api/), Org Slug, and the Project Name. Note that the Unity SDK creates a file at `Assets/Plugins/Sentry/SentryCliOptions.asset` to store the configuration, that should not be made publicly available.

### iOS - dSYM and Bitcode

Debug information files on the iOS platform are called dSYM, and the way to obtain them differs depending on whether `Enable Bitcode` is set to `true` in your Xcode project.

For Sentry to symbolicate your crash logs and with `bitcode` enabled, we need two types of files:
1. `dSYM` files available only **after** App Store Connect finishes processing the build
2. `BCSymbolMap` files that are created during the archiving process

The automated symbol upload will take care of the `BCSymbolMap` files by processing them during the archiving process. To provide the dSYM files to Sentry, you can either set up the [App Store Connect Integration](/platforms/apple/guides/ios/dsym/#bitcode-appstore) so Sentry can fetch them for you or download and then upload them [manually using sentry-cli](/platforms/apple/guides/ios/dsym/#bitcode-sentrycli).

With `bitcode` disabled, the automated symbols upload will pick up the `dSYM` files at the end of the build process without further action required.

### Manual Upload Using sentry-cli

You can either use the provided executables from within the package or follow the [sentry-cli documentation](/product/cli/installation/) to make it available globally. To upload debug symbols, run it with:

```bash
sentry-cli --auth-token YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN upload-dif --org ___ORG_SLUG___ --project ___PROJECT_SLUG___ PATH_TO_SYMBOLS
```
