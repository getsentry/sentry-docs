<Note>

Native support requires configuration using the Sentry Unity Editor window. Support for programatic initialization via C# is planned.

</Note>

Native support is `enabled` by default. The Unity SDK passes the options defined through the Sentry Unity Editor window during build time. For Android, it embeds the [Android SDK](/platforms/android/) inside the Gradle project created by Unity. The [iOS SDK](/platforms/apple/guides/ios/) is embedded inside the generated Xcode project. This means there's no need to use the Unity [built-in crash reporting](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/CrashReport.html) functionality.

You can opt out of native support by unchecking `iOS Native Support` and `Android Native Support` in the configuration window.

## Debug Symbols

Sentry requires [debug information files](/platforms/android/data-management/debug-files/) to symbolicate your crash logs. The Unity SDK provides an automated upload functionality for those symbol files that rely on the [sentry-cli](/product/cli/). We've included the executables for Windows, macOS, and Linux inside the Unity SDK package.

The automated debug symbols upload is enabled by default but requires configuration. Go to **Tools > Sentry > Editor** to enter the [Auth Token](https://sentry.io/api/), Org Slug, and the Project Name. Note that the Unity SDK creates a file at `Assets/Plugins/Sentry/SentryCliOptions.asset` to store the configuration, that should not be made publicly available.

### iOS - dSYM and Bitcode

Debug information files on the iOS platform are called dSYM, and the way to obtain them differs depending on whether `Enable Bitcode` is set to `true` in your Xcode project.

For Sentry to symbolicate your crash logs and with `bitcode` enabled, we need two types of files:
1. `dSYM` files available only **after** App Store Connect finishes processing the build
2. `BCSymbolMap` files that are created during the archiving process

The automated symbol upload will take care of the `BCSymbolMap` files by processing them during the archiving process. To provide the dSYM files to Sentry, you can either set up the [App Store Connect Integration](/platforms/apple/guides/ios/dsym/#bitcode-appstore) so Sentry can fetch them for you or download and then upload them [manually using sentry-cli](/platforms/apple/guides/ios/dsym/#bitcode-sentrycli).

With `bitcode` disabled, the automated symbols upload will pick up the `dSYM` files at the end of the build process without further action required.

### Manual Upload Using sentry-cli

You can either use the provided executables from within the package or follow the [sentry-cli documentation](/product/cli/installation/) to make it available globally. To upload debug symbols, run it with:

```bash
sentry-cli --auth-token YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN upload-dif --org ___ORG_SLUG___ --project ___PROJECT_SLUG___ PATH_TO_SYMBOLS
```
