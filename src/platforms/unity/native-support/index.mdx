Currently, the Unity SDK offers native support for Android, iOS, Windows, macOS and Linux. The support is set to `enabled` by default and you can opt out for each platform individually in the configuration window.

<Note>

The setup for the iOS and Android native SDKs happens during build time, with the options defined in the Sentry editor configuration window. Changes to the options object done through [ScriptableOptionsConfiguration](/platforms/unity/configuration/options/) will not affect events from the native layer.

The Unity SDK captures C# exceptions and does not break any builds targeting Nintendo Switch.

## Mobile

The native crash support for Android and iOS is achieved by modifying the generated platform-specific projects during build time. That way, the Sentry native crash support gets initialized before Unity, making it possible to capture errors of the Unity engine itself.

### Android

When choosing Android as a build target, Unity creates a Gradle project. During the Unity build process, the SDK embeds the [Android SDK](/platforms/android/), as well as the provided options, by adding it to the generated project's Android Manifest.

### iOS

When building your game for iOS, Unity exports it as an Xcode project. By modifying that generated project, the SDK adds the [iOS SDK](/platforms/apple/guides/ios/) to provide native support. It adds the initialization code to the `main.m` and generates the options provided by the editor configuration window as `SentryOptions.m`. The SDK also copies the `SentryNativeBridge` that enables the C# layer to communicate with the iOS SDK. This means that there's no need to use the Unity [built-in crash reporting](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/CrashReport.html) functionality.

The [iOS SDK](/platforms/apple/guides/ios/) supports capturing Objective-C exceptions which are disabled in the generated Xcode project by default. Consider enabling them in the "Build Settings" tab by setting `GCC_ENABLE_OBJC_EXCEPTIONS` to true.

## Desktop

The native support is configured and enabled as early as possible by the C# layer, right after the Unity engine starts. This is slightly different from on mobile where we inject native initialization code that runs before the Unity engine runs.

### Windows

On Windows, the Unity SDK includes the [Native SDK](/platforms/native/) with the crashpad backend. Windows native crashes are automatically captured through minidumps. To upload these to Sentry, the SDK copies the `crashpad_handler.exe` to the build output directory at the end of the build process. This executable must be included when shipping your game.

### macOS

The Native Support on macOS relies on the [macOS SDK](/platforms/apple/guides/macos/). Stackwalking happens in process.

### Linux

On Linux the Unity SDK includes the [Native SDK](/platforms/native/) with the breakpad backend. A minidump is created in process and no handler executable is required.

## Debug Symbols

Sentry requires [debug information files](/platforms/unity/data-management/debug-files/) to symbolicate your crashes. The Unity SDK provides an automated upload functionality for those symbol files that rely on the [sentry-cli](/product/cli/). This is done transparently so you're not required to run `sentry-cli` manually. The symbol upload happens during Unity build in the editor. We've included the executables for Windows, macOS, and Linux as part of the Unity SDK package.

The automated debug symbols upload is enabled by default but requires configuration. Go to **Tools > Sentry > Editor** to enter the [Auth Token](https://sentry.io/api/), Organization Slug, and the Project Name. Note that the Unity SDK creates a file at `Assets/Plugins/Sentry/SentryCliOptions.asset` to store the configuration, that should **not** be made publicly available.

### iOS - dSYM

Debug information files on the iOS platform are called dSYM.

For Sentry to symbolicate your crash logs we need two types of files:

1. `dSYM` that the automated symbols upload will pick up at the end of the build process without further action required.
2. `BCSymbolMap` files that are created during the archiving process

The automated symbol upload will take care of the `BCSymbolMap` files by processing them during the archiving process.

### Manual Upload Using sentry-cli

If you don't want to rely on the automated symbol upload, you can run `sentry-cli` through the commandline. For that, you can use the provided executables from within the package or follow the [sentry-cli documentation](/product/cli/installation/) to make it available globally. To upload debug symbols, run it with:

<SignInNote />

```bash
sentry-cli --auth-token YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN debug-files upload --org ___ORG_SLUG___ --project ___PROJECT_SLUG___ PATH_TO_SYMBOLS
```
