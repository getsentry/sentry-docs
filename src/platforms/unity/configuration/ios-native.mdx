Our Unity SDK currently provides native support for iOS and is enabled by default. It does this by embedding the [iOS SDK](/platforms/apple/guides/ios/) inside the generated Xcode project and passing the options to it at build time.
This means there's no need to use the Unity [built-in crash reporting](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/CrashReport.html) functionality.

To opt out, uncheck `iOS Native Support` in the configuration window or disable it as shown below:

```csharp
using Sentry.Unity;

SentryUnity.Init(o =>
{
    o.IOSNativeSupportEnabled = false;
});
```

## Debug Symbols

Our Unity SDK does not yet support the automated upload of debug symbols but since it is using the iOS SKD under the hood it can be set up following the documentation for [uploading](/platforms/apple/guides/ios/dsym/) them.
