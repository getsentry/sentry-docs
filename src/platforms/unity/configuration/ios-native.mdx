<Note>

Our Unity SDK currently supports native iOS when building for device only. Support for the iOS simulators is planned.

</Note>

<Note>

The iOS native support requires configuring using the Sentry Unity Editor window. Support for programatic initialization via C# will come in the form of documentation on how to initialize the iOS native SDK programatically too.

</Note>

The native iOS support is enabled by default. It's enabled by embedding the [iOS SDK](/platforms/apple/guides/ios/) inside the Xcode project generated by Unity and passing the options defined via the Sentry Unity Editor window at build time.

This means there's no need to use the Unity [built-in crash reporting](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/CrashReport.html) functionality.

To opt out, uncheck `iOS Native Support` in the configuration window.

## Debug Symbols

Our Unity SDK does not yet support the automated upload of debug symbols, but since it's using the iOS SDK, this can be set up by following our iOS documentation for [uploading](/platforms/apple/guides/ios/dsym/) them.
