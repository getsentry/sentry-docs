Our Unity SDK currently provides native support for iOS and is enabled by default. It does this by embedding the [Cocoa SDK](/platforms/apple/guides/ios/) inside the generated Xcode project and passing the options to it at build time.

To opt out, uncheck `iOS Native Support` in the configuration window or disable it as shown below:

```csharp
using Sentry.Unity;

SentryUnity.Init(o =>
{
    o.IOSNativeSupportEnabled = false;
});
```
