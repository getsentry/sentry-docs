<Note>

IL2CPP line number support is available in Beta and requires version 0.22.0 or later of the Sentry SDK for Unity. Beta features are still in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.

</Note>

<Note>

The feature is available from Unity versions `2020.3` and `2021.3` onwards. We are running tests in CI against the current LTS, starting from `2020.3.37f1` and `2021.3.6f1`.

</Note>

Unity provides you the option to select [IL2CPP](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/IL2CPP.html) as your scripting backend. This leads to C++ code being generated from your compiled C# (IL) code, hence the name `IL to CPP`.

The Sentry SDK provides line number support for IL2CPP builds for the following platforms:

- Windows (*currently limited to Unity 2021.3 or newer)
- macOS
- Linux
- Android
- iOS

When you build with IL2CPP, errors in your game will happen in the native code. Also, the mapping between your C# code and the generated C++ code is part of the build process and isn't shipped with your game. That means the event the Sentry SDK reports can only contain the native stack trace. To provide you with C# line numbers, the Sentry server needs to have access to that line mapping through [Debug Information Files](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/unity/data-management/debug-files/).

You can opt in to this feature through the editor configuration window by selecting `Tools -> Sentry -> Advanced -> IL2CPP line numbers` or [programmatically](/platforms/unity/configuration/options/#programmatic-configuration).

```csharp
options.Il2CppLineNumberSupportEnabled = true;
```

The support for line numbers in C# Exceptions with IL2CPP relies on the debug symbol upload. With the automated debug symbol upload enabled, the [Sentry SDK will upload the line mapping automatically](/platforms/unity/native-support/#debug-symbols).
