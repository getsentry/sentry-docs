<Note>

Native support requires configuration using the Sentry Unity Editor window. Support for programatic initialization via C# is planned.

</Note>

Native support is `enabled` by default. The Unity SDK passes the options defined through the Sentry Unity Editor window during build time. For Android, it embeds the [Android SDK](/platforms/android/) inside the Gradle project created by Unity. The [iOS SDK](/platforms/apple/guides/ios/) is embedded inside the generated Xcode project. This means there's no need to use the Unity [built-in crash reporting](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/CrashReport.html) functionality.

<Note>

Our Unity SDK currently supports native iOS when building for device only. Support for the iOS simulators is planned.

</Note>

You can opt out of native support by unchecking `iOS Native Support` and `Android Native Support` in the configuration window.

## Debug Symbols

Our Unity SDK does not yet support the automated upload of debug symbols, but since it's using other Sentry SDKs this can be set up manually. Check out our documentation for [iOS](/platforms/apple/guides/ios/dsym/) and [Android](/platforms/android/proguard/).
