In order to provide native crash support, the Sentry SDK for Unity includes platform-specific (that is, Native) SDKs, such as the [Android](/platforms/android/), [Apple](/platforms/apple/guides/ios/), and [Native](/platforms/native/). 

By default, we initialize the native SDKs before Unity itself runs. This allows us to capture bugs/crashes of the engine itself, any native plugin, and anything written in C#. The setup for the native SDKs happens during build time, which is why we rely on the options being set in the Sentry editor configuration window and saved to `Assets/Resources/Sentry/SentryOptions.asset`. To provide a way to modify options programmatically, we've added `ScriptableOptionsConfiguration` to the `Option Config`.

Note that changes to the options object done through `ScriptableOptionsConfiguration` do not affect events coming from the native layer. That also means that a `BeforeSend` callback will only modify events coming from C# scripts. The native SDKs only take options defined in the Sentry editor configuration window.

```csharp
using Sentry.Unity;
using UnityEngine;

[CreateAssetMenu(fileName = "Assets/Resources/Sentry/SentryOptionsConfiguration", menuName = "Sentry/SentryOptionsConfiguration", order = 999)]
public class SentryOptionsConfiguration : ScriptableOptionsConfiguration
{
    public override void Configure(SentryUnityOptions options)
    {
    }
}
```

The method `Configure` is called right before the .NET SDK is initialized and provides you with a place to, for example, implement your own filtering of events using the [BeforeSend](/platforms/unity/configuration/filtering/#using-platformidentifier-namebefore-send-) callback.
