<Note>

This is a `preview` version. We're looking for your feedback! If you want to use a stable version, please refer to <Link to="/platforms/unity/unity-lite/">Unity Lite</Link>.

</Note>

On this page, we get you up and running with Sentry's SDK, so that it will automatically report errors and exceptions in your application.

<Note>

If you don't already have an account and Sentry project established, head over to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/signup/), then return to this page.

## Install

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your applicationâ€™s runtime. 

Install it from [`Unity UPM`](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui.html) via [git url](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui.html)

```
https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-unity.git?path=/package
```

## Configure

Configuration should happen as early as possible in your application's lifecycle. Currently, there is only one approach to configure Sentry - Unity tools window.

Open `Tools` -> `Sentry`.

Sentry configuration window will be opened.

* `Enable` - enable Sentry events capturing
* `DSN` - Sentry DSN value

## Verify

This snippet includes an intentional error, so you can test that everything is working as soon as you set it up:
