_Unity Lite is a pure C# 6 SDK compiled with Unity and supported by all Unity platforms._

On this page, we get you up and running with Sentry's SDK, so that it will automatically report errors and exceptions in your application.

<Note>

This is a stable but lightweight SDK that doesn't support all of Sentry's features. It's in the process of being replaced by [Unity SDK](/platforms/unity).

</Note>

<PlatformContent includePath="framework-list" />

## Install

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your application’s runtime.

Get the SDK via the [Unity Package Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html) using a Git URL to Sentry's SDK repository:

```
https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-unity-lite.git#1.0.3
```

## Configure

Configuration should happen as early as possible in your application's lifecycle.

You can attach Sentry to a Game Object and initialize it with the DSN programatically:

```C#
var sentry = gameObject.AddComponent<SentrySdk>();
sentry.Dsn = "https://examplePublicKey@o0.ingest.sentry.io/0";
```

## Verify

This snippet includes an intentional error, so you can test that everything is working as soon as you set it up:

Once the SDK is configured with the DSN, you can call from anywhere:

```csharp
SentrySdk.CaptureMessage("Test event");
```

<Note>

Learn more about manually capturing an error or message, in our <PlatformLink to="/usage/">Usage documentation</PlatformLink>.

</Note>

To view and resolve the recorded error, log into [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and open your project. Clicking on the error's title will open a page where you can see detailed information and mark it as resolved.
