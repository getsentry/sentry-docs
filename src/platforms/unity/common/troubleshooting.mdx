## Installation Issues

### Installation via Git URL - `'HEAD': cannot update ref 'refs/heads/master'`

Some Unity versions, such as `2019.4.24f1` and `2020.3.2f1`, have a bug on UPM and fail to install with the error `'HEAD': cannot update ref 'refs/heads/master'`.
Unity has resolved this issue on newer releases. Learn more by checking the [Unity Issue Tracker](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/package-resolution-error-when-using-a-git-dependency-referencing-an-annotated-tag-in-its-git-url).

### PrecompiledAssemblyException: `Multiple precompiled assemblies with the same name`

The Sentry package includes a couple of DLLs that might have been already been provided by other packages. [Unity's package manager does not resolve](https://forum.unity.com/threads/dll-conflicts-in-two-upm-package.1084307/#post-7038340) those dependency issues which means it has to be done manually:

1. Choose which dependency you want to remove.
2. [Embed the package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-embed.html#embed-create) so you can modify it. This means you copy the package from Unity's global cache into your project's package directory and it should be version controlled.
3. Remove the additional dependency.
