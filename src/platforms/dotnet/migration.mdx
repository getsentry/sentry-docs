Migrating to `Sentry` version 3.0.5

</Note>

# Breaking changes

Please read through **all** breaking changes relevant to you before upgrading.

## !Important: Grouping Changes

The format of the stack traces were greatly improved with the help of Ben Adam's iconic library `Ben.Demystifier`. Frames now include details such as `async`, `static`, the actual return type, method parameters, tuples and their names, and more.

One big caveat is that this will **affect grouping!**. If you prefer to stay with the original stack trace format, you can opt-out of this feature with:

```
options.StackTraceMode = StackTraceMode.Original;
```

## Namespace change

Classes under `Sentry.Protocol` were moved to the root namespace `Sentry`. All except `Context` classes like `App`, `Device`, etc.

## ASP.NET

ASP.NET (**not Core**) users need to install an additional package:

`Sentry.AspNet`.

Without this, HTTP related information will not be added to events.

You can plug it in to the `Init` as follows:
```
SentrySdk.Init(o =>
{
    o.AddAspNet();
});
```

The motivation was to remove the reference to `System.Web` to decouple the core of the package with any specific namespaces of the .NET Framework, which improves the experience from other environments such as game engines like Unity and [Godot](https://gatomalo.dev/blog/2020/03/21/error-monitoring-godot-sentry/#android).

## ASP.NET Core Environment Casing

To match Sentry's default environment naming convention, unless explicitly set otherwise, the Sentry environment will be reported lowercase. That means if `ASPNET_ENVIRONMENT` is equal to `Production`, the Sentry SDK will report it as `production`.

## `IHub` and `ISentryClient` received new methods

Sentry's Performance product requires additive API changes to interfaces such as `IHub` and `ISentryClient`.
If you implement your own `IHub`, you'll need to implement two new methods:

`ISentryClient` received: `CaptureTransaction`.
`IHub` received: `StartTransaction` and `GetTraceHeader`.

## `DiagnosticsLogger` renamed to `DiagnosticLogger`

To align with other SDKs, the option is now named: `DiagnosticLogger`
[Docs PR](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-docs/pull/2945).

## `Dsn` is just a string

`SentryOptions` now take a string for `Dsn`:

Before: `o.Dsn = new Dsn("..");`
After: `o.Dsn = "..";`

## `LogEntry` became `Message`

The property of `SentryEvent` that supports a structured log entry was renamed to `Message` to align with the protocol and other SDKs.

## Sentry On Premise Support

This version uses the [envelope endpoint](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/envelopes/). If you are using an on-premise installation it requires Sentry version >= v20.6.0 to work. If you are using sentry.io nothing will change and no action is needed.

# New features and improvements

## Offline Caching

You can optionally have events cached to disk.
To do that, you must specify which directory the SDK can use to write the crash files:

`options.CacheDirectoryPath = Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.LocalApplicationData))`

## Attachments

You can add attachments to events now. Please refer to the [Attachments documentation](../enriching-events/attachments/).

## User Feedback

You can add user feedback to events via a .NET API. Please refer to the [User Feedback documentation](../enriching-events/user-feedback/).


## ASP.NET Core gRPC support

A new package was added ASP.NET Core gPRC support. With the ability to log the request payload in case of errors.
