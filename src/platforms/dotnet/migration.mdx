## Migrating from Sentry SDK v2.x to Sentry SDK v3.x

Upgrading to Sentry SDK v3.x includes the following breaking changes and new features.

### Breaking Changes

Please read through **all** breaking changes relevant to you before upgrading.

#### !Important: Grouping Changes

The format of the stack traces were greatly improved with the help of Ben Adam's iconic library `Ben.Demystifier`. Frames now include details such as `async`, `static`, the actual return type, method parameters, tuples and their names, and more.

One big caveat is that this will **affect grouping!**. If you prefer to stay with the original stack trace format, you can opt-out of this feature with:

```
options.StackTraceMode = StackTraceMode.Original;
```

#### Namespace Change

Classes under `Sentry.Protocol` were moved to the root namespace `Sentry`. All except `Context` classes like `App`, `Device`, etc.

#### ASP.NET

ASP.NET (**not Core**) users need to install an additional package:

`Sentry.AspNet`.

Without this, HTTP related information will not be added to events.

You can plug it in to the `Init` as follows:
```
SentrySdk.Init(o =>
{
    o.AddAspNet();
});
```

The motivation was to remove the reference to `System.Web` to decouple the core of the package with any specific namespaces of the .NET Framework, which improves the experience from other environments such as game engines like Unity and [Godot](https://gatomalo.dev/blog/2020/03/21/error-monitoring-godot-sentry/#android).

#### ASP.NET Core Environment Casing

To match Sentry's default environment naming convention, unless explicitly set otherwise, the Sentry environment will be reported lowercase. That means if `ASPNET_ENVIRONMENT` is equal to `Production`, the Sentry SDK will report it as `production`.

#### ASP.NET Core `IncludeRequestPayload`

The option `IncludeRequestPayload` that was deprecated in the Sentry SDK 2.0 has been removed.
The replacement is the option `MaxRequestBodySize`.

#### `IHub` and `ISentryClient` Received New Methods

Sentry's Performance product requires additive API changes to interfaces such as `IHub` and `ISentryClient`.
If you implement your own `IHub`, you'll need to implement two new methods:

`ISentryClient` received: `CaptureTransaction`.
`IHub` received: `StartTransaction` and `GetTraceHeader`.

#### `DiagnosticsLogger` Renamed to `DiagnosticLogger`

To align with other SDKs, the option is now named: `DiagnosticLogger`
[Docs PR](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-docs/pull/2945).

#### `Dsn` as a String

`SentryOptions` now take a string for `Dsn`:

Before: `o.Dsn = new Dsn("..");`
After: `o.Dsn = "..";`

#### `LogEntry` Became `Message`

The property of `SentryEvent` that supports a structured log entry was renamed to `Message` to align with the protocol and other SDKs.

#### Sentry Self-Hosted Support

This version uses the [envelope endpoint](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/envelopes/). If you are using an on-premise installation it requires Sentry version >= v20.6.0 to work. If you are using sentry.io nothing will change and no action is needed.

### New Features and Improvements

#### Offline Caching

You can optionally have events cached to disk.
To do that, you must specify which directory the SDK can use to write the crash files:

`options.CacheDirectoryPath = Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.LocalApplicationData))`

#### Attachments

You can add attachments to events now. Please refer to the [Attachments documentation](../enriching-events/attachments/).

#### User Feedback

You can add user feedback to events via a .NET API. Please refer to the [User Feedback documentation](../enriching-events/user-feedback/).

#### ASP.NET Core gRPC support

A new package was added ASP.NET Core gPRC support. With the ability to log the request payload in case of errors.

### Release Notes

Please refer to [GitHub for the complete release notes](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/releases/tag/3.0.0).

## Migrating from SharpRaven to Sentry SDK

Below are the main differences between SharpRaven and Sentry SDK.

### List of Differences Between SharpRaven and Sentry SDK

Here is a list of features available in Sentry SDK that are not available in SharpRaven.

#### Sentry Package

- Automatic Captures global unhandled exceptions (AppDomain)
- Scope management
- Duplicate events automatically dropped
- Events from the same exception automatically dropped
- Web proxy support
- HttpClient/HttpClientHandler configuration callback
- Compress request body
- Event sampling opt-in
- Event flooding protection (429 retry-after and internal bound queue)
- Release automatically set (AssemblyInformationalVersionAttribute, AssemblyVersion or env var)
- DSN discovered via environment variable
- Release (version) reported automatically
- CLS Compliant
- Strong named
- BeforeSend and BeforeBreadcrumb callbacks
- Event and Exception processors
- SourceLink (including PDB in nuget package)
- Device OS info sent
- Device Runtime info sent
- Enable SDK debug mode (opt-in)
- Attach stack trace for captured messages (opt-in)

#### Sentry.Extensions.Logging

- Includes all features from the Sentry package.
- BeginScope data added to Sentry scope, sent with events
- LogInformation or higher added as breadcrumb, sent with next events.
- LogError or higher automatically captures an event
- Minimal levels are configurable.

#### Sentry.AspNetCore

- Includes all features from the Sentry package.
- Includes all features from the Sentry.Extensions.Logging package.
- Easy ASP.NET Core integration, single line: UseSentry.
- Captures unhandled exceptions in the middleware pipeline
- Captures exceptions handled by the framework UseExceptionHandler and Error page display.
- Any event sent will include relevant application log messages
- RequestId as tag
- URL as tag
- Environment is automatically set (IHostingEnvironment)
- Request payload can be captured if opt-in
- Support for EventProcessors registered with DI
- Support for ExceptionProcessors registered with DI
- Captures logs from the request (using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging)
- Supports configuration system (e.g: appsettings.json)
- Server OS info sent
- Server Runtime info sent
- Request headers sent
- Request body compressed

All packages are:

- Strong named
- Tested on Windows, Linux and macOS
- Tested on .NET Core, .NET Framework and Mono

It's also very configurable, for example:

- HTTP Proxy
- Event sampling
- Enable request body extraction
- Send PII data (Personal Identifiable Information, requires opt-in)
- Read diagnostics activity data
- BeforeSend: Callback to modify/reject event before sending
- BeforeBreadcrumb: Callback to modify/reject a breadcrumb
- LogEventFilter: Filter events by inspecting log data
- Maximum number of breadcrumbs to store
- Event queue depth
- Shutdown timeout: If there are events to send, how long to wait until shutdown
- Accept compressed response
- Compress request body
- Breadcrumb level: Minimum log level to store as a breadcrumb
- Event level: Minimum log level to send an event to Sentry
- Disable duplicate event detection
- Disable capture of global unhandled exceptions
- Add event processor
- Add exception processor
- Enable SDK debug mode
- Attach stack trace for captured messages (opt-in)

### Breaking Changes

Upgrading from SharpRaven to Sentry SDK includes the following breaking changes.

#### .NET Framework Support Reduced

If your project is targeting .NET Framework, it will need to be using at least v4.6.1 to use Sentry (SharpRaven supported .NET Framework v3.5 and higher).

#### Initialization

Changed how to initialize Sentry:

```csharp
using Sentry;

// Initialize with DSN
SentrySdk.Init("___PUBLIC_DSN___");

// Initialize with options
SentrySdk.Init(o =>
{
    o.Dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___";
});
```

For ASP.NET (classic) integration, add `Sentry.AspNet` package and initialize it by calling `o.AddAspNet()`:

```csharp
using Sentry;
using Sentry.AspNet;

SentrySdk.Init(o =>
{
    o.Dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___";

    o.AddAspNet();
});
```

#### Event Queue

Contrary to SharpRaven, events in Sentry SDK are sent in background without blocking the currently executing code. Calling `SentrySdk.CaptureException(...)` does not immediately send an event, but instead queues it up on a background thread.

Usage changes:

```csharp
// Before
ravenClient.Capture(...);
await ravenClient.CaptureAsync(...);

// After
SentrySdk.CaptureEvent(...);
```

You can flush the event queue by invoking the `IDisposable` returned by `SentrySdk.Init(...)`:

```csharp
var sentryInitialization = SentrySdk.Init("___PUBLIC_DSN___");

// Capture a non-error message
SentrySdk.CaptureMessage("hello world");

// Tear down Sentry and flush queued up events
sentryInitialization.Dispose();
```

#### Event Processors

Usage changes:

```csharp
// Before
ravenClient.BeforeSend = requester =>
{
    // Here you can log data from the requester
    // or replace it entirely if you want.
    return requester;
};

// After
SentrySdk.Init(o =>
{
    o.BeforeSend = e =>
    {
        // Mutate the event or return null to drop it altogether
        return e;
    };
}
});
```
