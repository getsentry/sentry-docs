Sentry has an integration for the [.NET Multi-platform App UI (MAUI)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/maui) through the [Sentry.Maui NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sentry.Maui).

## Installation

Add the Sentry dependency:

```powershell {tabTitle:Package Manager}
Install-Package Sentry.Maui -Version {{ packages.version('sentry.dotnet.maui') }}
```

```shell {tabTitle:.NET Core CLI}
dotnet add package Sentry.Maui -v {{ packages.version('sentry.dotnet.maui') }}
```

This package extends [Sentry.Extensions.Logging](/platforms/dotnet/guides/extensions-logging/). This means that besides the MAUI related features, through this package you'll also get access to all the framework's logging integration and also the features available in the main [Sentry](/platforms/dotnet/) SDK.

### Configure

In your `MauiProgram.cs` file, call `UseSentry` on your `MauiAppBuilder`, and include any options you would like to set.  The `Dsn` is the only required parameter.

For example:

```csharp
public static MauiApp CreateMauiApp() =>
    MauiApp.CreateBuilder()
        .UseMauiApp<App>()
        .UseSentry(options =>
        {
            options.Dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___";
        })
        // The remainder of your configuration
        .Build();
}
```

## Preview Status

The `Sentry.Maui` SDK is currently in public preview.  All APIs added by this package are subject to breaking changes.  We appreciate your feedback, and would love to hear from you!
