Sentry has an integration for the [.NET Multi-platform App UI (MAUI)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/maui) through the [Sentry.Maui NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sentry.Maui).

## Overview of the features

- Easy MAUI integration by calling `UseSentry` on your `MauiAppBuilder`
- All the features of our main [.NET SDK](/platforms/dotnet), for your managed code
- Native crash reporting for Android, leveraging our [Android SDK](/platforms/android)
- Managed crash reporting (unhandled exceptions), on any MAUI platform
- Automatic breadcrumbs for MAUI app lifecycle and UI events
- Detailed device and runtime information passed on every event
- ... more coming soon!

## Preview Status

The `Sentry.Maui` SDK is currently in public preview.  All APIs added by this package are subject to breaking changes.  We appreciate your feedback:

- [Open Issues (GitHub)](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AMAUI)
- [New Issues or Feature Requests (GitHub)](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/issues/new/choose)
- [Community Chat (Discord)](https://discord.com/channels/621778831602221064/621783515423440927)

This documentation will be updated as we get closer to general availability release.

## Installation

Add the Sentry dependency to your .NET MAUI application:

```shell {tabTitle:.NET Core CLI}
dotnet add package Sentry.Maui --prerelease
```

```powershell {tabTitle:Package Manager}
Install-Package Sentry.Maui -AllowPrereleaseVersions
```

This package extends [Sentry.Extensions.Logging](/platforms/dotnet/guides/extensions-logging/). This means that besides the MAUI related features, through this package you'll also get access to all the framework's logging integration and also the features available in the main [Sentry](/platforms/dotnet/) SDK.

### Configure

In your `MauiProgram.cs` file, call `UseSentry` on your `MauiAppBuilder`, and include any options you would like to set.  The `Dsn` is the only required parameter.

For example:

```csharp
public static MauiApp CreateMauiApp() =>
    MauiApp.CreateBuilder()
        .UseMauiApp<App>()
        .UseSentry(options =>
        {
            options.Dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___";
        })
        // The remainder of your configuration
        .Build();
}
```

## Options

As previously mentioned, this package is a wrapper around [Sentry.Extensions.Logging](/platforms/dotnet/guides/extensions-logging/) and [Sentry](/platforms/dotnet/). Please refer to the documentation of these packages to get the options that are defined at those levels.

Below, the options that are specific to `Sentry.Maui` will be described.

### IncludeTextInBreadcrumbs

This option controls whether elements that implement the `IText` interface (such as `Button`, `Label`, `Entry`, and others) will have their text included on breadcrumbs.  This option is disabled by default.

### IncludeTitleInBreadcrumbs

This option contols whether elements that implement the `ITitledElement` interface (such as `Window`, `Page`, and others) will have their titles included on breadcrumbs.  This option is disabled by default.

<Alert level="warning">

</Alert>

### IncludeBackgroundingStateInBreadcrumbs
