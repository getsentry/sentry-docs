Sentry has an integration for the [.NET Multi-platform App UI (MAUI)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/maui) through the [Sentry.Maui NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sentry.Maui).

## Overview of the features

- Easy MAUI integration by calling `UseSentry` on your `MauiAppBuilder`
- All the features of our main [.NET SDK](/platforms/dotnet), for your managed code
- Native crash reporting for Android, leveraging our [Android SDK](/platforms/android)
- Native crash reporting for iOS and Mac Catalyst, leveraging our [Cocoa SDK for iOS](/platforms/apple/guides/ios)
- Managed crash reporting (unhandled exceptions), on all MAUI platforms (iOS, Android, Windows, Mac Catalyst, and Tizen)
- Line numbers for your .NET stack traces when PDBs are uploaded to Sentry
- Automatic breadcrumbs for MAUI app lifecycle and UI events
- Detailed device and runtime information passed on every event
- Automatic session tracking enabled, to support [release health](/product/releases/)

## Installation

Add the Sentry dependency to your .NET MAUI application:

```shell {tabTitle:.NET Core CLI}
dotnet add package Sentry.Maui -v {{@inject packages.version('sentry.dotnet.maui') }}
```

```powershell {tabTitle:Package Manager}
Install-Package Sentry.Maui -Version {{@inject packages.version('sentry.dotnet.maui') }}
```

This package extends [Sentry.Extensions.Logging](/platforms/dotnet/guides/extensions-logging/). This means that besides the MAUI related features, through this package you'll also get access to all the framework's logging integration and also the features available in the main [Sentry](/platforms/dotnet/) SDK.

### Configure

In your `MauiProgram.cs` file, call `UseSentry` on your `MauiAppBuilder`, and include any options you would like to set. The `Dsn` is the only required parameter.

<SignInNote />

```csharp
public static MauiApp CreateMauiApp()
{
    var builder = MauiApp.CreateBuilder();
    builder
        .UseMauiApp<App>()

        // Add this section anywhere on the builder:
        .UseSentry(options =>
        {
            // The DSN is the only required setting.
            options.Dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___";

            // Use debug mode if you want to see what the SDK is doing.
            // Debug messages are written to stdout with Console.Writeline,
            // and are viewable in your IDE's debug console or with 'adb logcat', etc.
            // This option is not recommended when deploying your application.
            options.Debug = true;

            // Set TracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100% of transactions for performance monitoring.
            // We recommend adjusting this value in production.
            options.TracesSampleRate = 1.0;

            // Other Sentry options can be set here.
        })

        // ... the remainder of your MAUI app setup

    return builder.Build();
}
```

## Options

As previously mentioned, this package is a wrapper around [Sentry.Extensions.Logging](/platforms/dotnet/guides/extensions-logging/) and [Sentry](/platforms/dotnet/). Please refer to the documentation of these packages to get the options that are defined at those levels.

Below, the options that are specific to `Sentry.Maui` will be described.

### IncludeTextInBreadcrumbs

This option controls whether elements that implement the `IText` interface (such as `Button`, `Label`, `Entry`, and others) will have their text included on breadcrumbs. This option is disabled by default.

<Alert level="warning">

Use caution when enabling, as such values may contain personally identifiable information (PII).

</Alert>

### IncludeTitleInBreadcrumbs

This option contols whether elements that implement the `ITitledElement` interface (such as `Window`, `Page`, and others) will have their titles included on breadcrumbs. This option is disabled by default.

<Alert level="warning">

Use caution when enabling, as such values may contain personally identifiable information (PII).

</Alert>

### IncludeBackgroundingStateInBreadcrumbs

Controls whether the breadcrumb sent for the `Window.Backgrounding` event will include state data from `BackgroundingEventArgs.State`. This option is disabled by default.

<Alert level="warning">

Use caution when enabling, as such values may contain personally identifiable information (PII).
