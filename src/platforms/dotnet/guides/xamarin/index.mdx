Sentry's .NET SDK works with Xamarin applications through the [Sentry Xamarin NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sentry.Xamarin) and Xamarin Forms with the [Sentry Xamarin Forms NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sentry.Xamarin.Forms).

The SDK is compatible with the following versions or higher:
* Xamarin.Android 9.0
* Xamarin.iOS 10.14
* Universal Windows Platform 10.0.16299
* Tizen 4.0

## Install

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-install" />

## Configure

After you’ve completed setting up a project in Sentry, Sentry will give you a value which we call a DSN or Data Source Name. It looks a lot like a standard URL, but it’s just a representation of the configuration required by the Sentry SDKs. It consists of a few pieces, including the protocol, public key, the server address, and the project identifier.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-config" />

## Verify

Great! Now that you’ve completed setting up the SDK, maybe you want to quickly test out how Sentry works. Start by capturing an exception:

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-verify" />


The SDK automatically handles `AppDomain.UnhandledException` and `Application.UnhandledException`, so you'll not need to worry about trying to Catch Unhandled Exceptions.

### Xamarin Options

The following options are only going to be valid during the SDK initialization.

#### DisableNativeIntegration

Disable the native event processor for Android,iOS,UWP

#### DisableXamarinFormsCache

By calling it, the SDK will not automatically Cache your events and they might be lost if a hard crash happens or no connectivity is available during the transport of the event.

### Xamarin Forms Options

#### DisableXamarinWarningsBreadcrumbs

Disables the automatic Logging of internal Warnings that comes from Xamarin Forms.

## Samples
