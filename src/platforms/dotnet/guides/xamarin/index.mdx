Sentry's .NET SDK works with Xamarin applications through the [Sentry Xamarin NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sentry.Xamarin) and Xamarin Forms with the [Sentry Xamarin Forms NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sentry.Xamarin.Forms).

The SDK is compatible with the following versions or higher:
* Xamarin.Android 9.0
* Xamarin.iOS 10.14
* Universal Windows Platform 10.0.16299
* Tizen 4.0

## Configuration

All you need to do is to [initialize the SDK with `SentryXamarin.Init`](/platforms/dotnet/), you will not need any additional changes to get the SDK ready to go.

The SDK automatically handles `AppDomain.UnhandledException` and `Application.UnhandledException`, so you'll not need to worry about trying to Catch Unhandled Exceptions.

### Xamarin Options

The following options are only going to be valid during the SDK initialization.

#### DisableNativeIntegration

Disable the native event processor for Android,iOS,UWP

#### DisableXamarinFormsCache

By calling it, the SDK will not automatically Cache your events and they might be lost if a hard crash happens or no connectivity is available during the transport of the event.

### Xamarin Forms Options

#### DisableXamarinWarningsBreadcrumbs

Disables the automatic Logging of internal Warnings that comes from Xamarin Forms.

## Samples

- An [example](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet-xamarin/tree/main/Samples) using Xamarin Forms and most of the SDK features. (**Android,iOS,UWP**)
