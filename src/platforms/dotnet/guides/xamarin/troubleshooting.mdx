### Offline Caching Information 

For users on Xamarin iOS, offline caching may cause this tricky issue.

#### Event/Transaction Capture - `Failed to send cached envelope: System.MissingMethodException: Method not found: System.Text.Json.JsonDocument`

If this message displays when capturing an event or transaction on your debug window, manually edit your platform `csproj`:

1. Close your IDE
2. Open your iOS `.csproj` with a text or xml editor
3. Add the following NuGet reference:
```xml
    <PackageReference Include="System.Memory" IncludeAssets="None">
      <Version>4.5.4</Version>
    </PackageReference>
```  
<Note>

It's important to add the `IncludeAssets` as `None`, otherwise this fix will not work.

</Note>

4. Save and open your IDE
5. Wait for the IDE to restore the packages. Once finished, try to capture an exception or transaction


Another way to validate if the problem is happening on an iOS project, is by adding the following code to your iOS project to check if there's a conflict:
```csharp
    _ = new byte[2].AsMemory();
```
