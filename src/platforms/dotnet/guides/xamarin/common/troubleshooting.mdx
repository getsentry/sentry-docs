## Installation Issues

### Event/Transaction Capture - `Failed to send cached envelope: System.MissingMethodException: Method not found: System.Text.Json.JsonDocument`

If the above message appears for you when capturing an event or transaction on your debug window, you'll have to edit your have to manually edit your platform csproj 

1. close your IDE
2. open your iOS .csproj with an text/xml editor
3. add the following nuget reference:
```xml
    <PackageReference Include="System.Memory" IncludeAssets="None">
      <Version>4.5.4</Version>
    </PackageReference>
```  
NOTE: it's important to add the IncludeAssets as None, otherwise this fix will not work.

4. save and open your IDE
5. wait for it to restore the packages and once finished try to capture an exception or transaction.

Another way to validate if the problem is happening on an iOS project, is by adding the following code to your project and check if there's any conflict:
```csharp
    _ = new byte[2].AsMemory();
```
