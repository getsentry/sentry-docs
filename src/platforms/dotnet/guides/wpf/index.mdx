Sentry's .NET SDK works with Windows Presentation Foundation applications through the [Sentry NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sentry). It works with WPF apps running on .NET Framework 4.6.1, .NET Core 3.0 or higher.

## Configuration

In addition to [initializing the SDK with `SentrySdk.Init`](/platforms/dotnet/), you must configure the WPF specific error handler.

<Note>

The SDK should be initialized in the constructor of your application class (usually `App.xaml.cs`). Do not initialize the SDK in the `OnStartup()` event of the application or the `Hub` will not be initialized correctly.

</Note>

The SDK automatically handles `AppDomain.UnhandledException`. On WPF, for production apps (when no debugger is attached), WPF catches exception to show the dialog to the user. You can also configure your app to capture those exceptions before the dialog shows up:

```csharp
using System.Windows;

public partial class App : Application
{
    public App()
    {
        DispatcherUnhandledException += App_DispatcherUnhandledException;
    }

    void App_DispatcherUnhandledException(object sender, DispatcherUnhandledExceptionEventArgs e)
    {
        SentrySdk.CaptureException(e.Exception);

        // If you want to avoid the application from crashing:
        e.Handled = true;
    }
}
```
