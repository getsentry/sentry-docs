Sentry provides an integration with AWS Lambda ASP.NET Core Server through the [Sentry.AspNetCore NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sentry.AspNetCore).

## Install

Add the Sentry dependency:

```powershell {tabTitle:Package Manager}
Install-Package Sentry.AspNetCore -Version {{ packages.version('sentry.dotnet.aspnetcore') }}
```

```shell {tabTitle:.NET Core CLI}
dotnet add package Sentry.AspNetCore -v {{ packages.version('sentry.dotnet.aspnetcore') }}
```

You can combine this integration with a logging library like `log4net`, `NLog`, or `Serilog` to include both request data as well as your logs as breadcrumbs. The logging ingrations also capture events when an error is logged.


### Configuring

All `ASP.NET Core` configurations are valid here. But one configuration in particular is relevant.

`FlushOnCompletedRequest` ensures all events are flushed out. This is beacause the general ASP.NET Core hooks for when the process is exiting are not guaranteed to run in a serverless environment. This setting ensures that no event is lost if AWS recycles the process.

```csharp

public class LambdaEntryPoint : Amazon.Lambda.AspNetCoreServer.APIGatewayProxyFunction
{
    protected override void Init(IWebHostBuilder builder)
    {
        builder
            // Add Sentry
            .UseSentry(o =>
            {
              o.Dsn = "__PUBLIC_DSN__";
              // Required in Serverless environments
              o.FlushOnCompletedRequest = true;
            })
            .UseStartup<Startup>();
    }
}
```
