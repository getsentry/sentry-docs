Sentry provides an integration with `Google Cloud Functions` through the [Sentry.Google.Cloud.Functions NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/sentry.google.cloud.functions).

## Overview of the Features

- Easy Google Cloud Functions integration, single line: `UseSentry`
- Captures unhandled exceptions in the middleware pipeline
- Captures exceptions handled by the framework `UseExceptionHandler` and Error page display
- Captures process-wide unhandled exceptions (AppDomain)
- Captures `LogError` or `LogCritical`
- Any event sent will include relevant application log messages
- RequestId as tag
- URL as tag
- Environment is automatically set (IHostingEnvironment)
- Release automatically set (`AssemblyInformationalVersionAttribute`, `AssemblyVersion` or environment variable)
- Request payload can be captured if opt-in
- Support for EventProcessors registered with DI
- Support for ExceptionProcessors registered with DI
- Supports configuration system (bind to `SentryAspNetCoreOptions`)
- Server OS info sent
- Server Runtime info sent
- Request headers sent
- HTTP Proxy configuration
- Request body compressed
- Event flooding protection (429 retry-after and internal bound queue)
- Assembly Strong named

## Installation

Add the Sentry dependency:

```powershell {tabTitle:Package Manager}
Install-Package Sentry.Google.Cloud.Functions -Version {{ packages.version('sentry.dotnet.google-cloud-function') }}
```

```shell {tabTitle:.NET Core CLI}
dotnet add package Sentry.Google.Cloud.Functions -v {{ packages.version('sentry.dotnet.google-cloud-function') }}
```

This package extends `Sentry` main SDK. That means that besides the logging-related features, through this package you'll also get access to all API and features available in the main `Sentry` SDK.

<Alert level="warning" title="Note">

Messages logged from assemblies with the name starting with `Sentry` will not generate events.

## Configuration

The simplest way to configure the `Sentry.Google.Cloud.Functions` package is by using the assembly method `FunctionsStartup` to include the type `SentryStartup`, for example:
```csharp
//your function.cs

using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Google.Cloud.Functions.Framework;
using Google.Cloud.Functions.Hosting;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;

[assembly: FunctionsStartup(typeof(SentryStartup))]

public class Function : IHttpFunction
{
}
```

When using `[assembly: FunctionsStartup(typeof(SentryStartup))]`, the framework automatically loads `appsettings.json` and environment variables, binding to `SentryAspNetCoreOptions`.

For example:

```json {filename:appsettings.json}
  "Sentry": {
    "Dsn": "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    "MaxRequestBodySize": "Always",
    "SendDefaultPii": true,
    "MinimumBreadcrumbLevel": "Debug",
    "MinimumEventLevel": "Warning",
    "AttachStackTrace": true,
    "Debug": true,
    "DiagnosticsLevel": "Error"
  },
```

> An example of some of the options that can be configured via `appsettings.json`.

ASP.NET Core will automatically read this environment variable and bind it to the SDK configuration object.

Some of the settings require actual code. For those, like the `BeforeSend` callback you will need to create a new FunctionsStartup class to set it up:

```csharp
using Google.Cloud.Functions.Hosting;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Sentry.AspNetCore;

[assembly: FunctionsStartup(typeof(CustomOptions))]

public class CustomOptions : FunctionsStartup
{
    public override void ConfigureServices(WebHostBuilderContext context, IServiceCollection services)
    {
        base.ConfigureServices(context, services);
        services.Configure<SentryAspNetCoreOptions>(options =>
        {
            options.BeforeSend = @event =>
            {
                @event.ServerName = null;
                return @event;
            };
        });
    }
}
```

> Example modifying all events before they are sent to avoid server names being reported.

## Dependency Injection

Much of the behavior of the Google cloud functions integration with Sentry can be customized by using the frameworks dependency injection system. That is done by registering your own implementation of some of the exposed abstraction inside of `FunctionsStartup`.

### Capturing the Affected User

When opting-in to [SendDefaultPii](#senddefaultpii), the SDK will automatically read the user from the request by inspecting `HttpContext.User`. Default claim values like `NameIdentifier` for the _Id_ will be used.

If you wish to change the behavior of how to read the user from the request, you can register a new `IUserFactory` into the container:

```csharp
using Google.Cloud.Functions.Hosting;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Sentry.AspNetCore;

[assembly: FunctionsStartup(typeof(UserFactoryStartup))]

public class UserFactoryStartup : FunctionsStartup
{
    public override void ConfigureServices(WebHostBuilderContext context, IServiceCollection services)
    {
        base.ConfigureServices(context, services);
        services.AddSingleton<IUserFactory, MyUserFactory>();
    }
}
```

## Options & Initialization

As previously mentioned, this package is a wrapper around [Sentry.Extensions.Logging](/platforms/dotnet/guides/extensions-logging/), [Sentry.AspNetCore](/platforms/dotnet/guides/aspnetcore/) and [Sentry](/platforms/dotnet/). Please refer to the documentation of these packages to get the options that are defined at those levels.

Below, the options that are specific to `Sentry.Google.Cloud.Functions` will be described.

### SendDefaultPii

Although this setting is part of the [Sentry](/platforms/dotnet/) package, in the context of ASP.NET Core, it means reporting the user by reading the frameworks `HttpContext.User`. The strategy to create the `SentryUser` can be customized. Please read [retrieving user info](#capturing-the-affected-user) for more.

### Environment

The environment name is automatically populated by reading the framework's `IHostingEnvironment` value.

This option is part of the [Sentry](/platforms/dotnet/) package. The value of `IHostingEnvironment` will only be used if **no other method was used**.

Methods that take precedence over `IHostingEnvironment` are:

- Programmatically: `options.Environment`
- Environment variable _SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT_
- Configuration system like `appsettings.json`

### MaxRequestBodySize

This parameter controls whether integrations should capture HTTP request bodies. It can be set to one of the following values:

- `never`: Request bodies are never sent.
- `small`: Only small request bodies will be captured. The cutoff for small depends on the SDK (typically 4KB).
- `medium`: Medium and small requests will be captured (typically 10KB).
- `always`: The SDK will always capture the request body as long as Sentry can make sense of it.

If the request bodies should be captured, all requests will have the `EnableRewind` method invoked. This is done so that the request data can be read later, in case an error happens while processing the request.

### Other Options

- For more option configurations, please visit the [Basic Options Configuration](configuration/options/) page.

### Samples
