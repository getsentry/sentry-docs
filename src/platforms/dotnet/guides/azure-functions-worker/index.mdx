Sentry provides an integration with Azure Functions Isolated Worker through the [Sentry.AzureFunctions.Worker NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sentry.AzureFunctions.Worker).
All triggers are supported.

## Install

Add the Sentry dependency:

```powershell {tabTitle:Package Manager}
Install-Package Sentry.AzureFunctions.Worker -Version {{@inject packages.version('sentry.dotnet.azurefunctions.worker') }}
```

```shell {tabTitle:.NET Core CLI}
dotnet add package Sentry.AzureFunctions.Worker -v {{@inject packages.version('sentry.dotnet.azurefunctions.worker') }}
```

You can combine this integration with a logging library like `log4net`, `NLog`, or `Serilog`. The logging integration also captures events when an error is logged.

## Configure

All `ASP.NET Core` configurations are valid here. But one configuration in particular is relevant.

`FlushOnCompletedRequest` ensures all events are flushed out. This is because the general ASP.NET Core hooks for when the process is exiting are not guaranteed to run in a serverless environment. This setting ensures that no event is lost if AWS recycles the process.

```csharp
var host = new HostBuilder()
    .ConfigureFunctionsWorkerDefaults((host, builder) =>
    {
        builder.UseSentry(host, options =>
        {
            // o.Dsn = "<DSN>";
            options.EnableTracing = true;
            // When configuring for the first time, to see what the SDK is doing:
            // options.Debug = true;
        });
    })
    .Build();
await host.RunAsync();
```

## Samples
