## Configuration Issues

### Proxy Server

Often, your server can only access the internet through a proxy server.
If that's the case, make sure your proxy server is listed in the `web.config` so the `HttpClient`
used by Sentry's SDK can pick it up.

```xml
<system.net>
    <defaultProxy>
      <proxy proxyaddress="http://proxy.address.here" bypassonlocal="true" />
    </defaultProxy>
</system.net>
```

### TLS 1.2 Support & Windows Server

If you're not able to capture events from ASP.NET to Sentry
on older versions of Windows Server, with the older .NET Framework, you must enable TLS 1.2.

```
using System.Net;

ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol = SecurityProtocolType.Tls12
```

### SentrSdk.Init With Error

If you get the following error during Sentry initialization, you may have a misconfiguration on your Web.config:

`System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Could not load file or assembly System.Net.Http, Version=4.0.0.0`

You can fix it with one of the three solutions below:

- Find the `assemblyIdentity` for `System.Net.Http` and remove the `bindingRedirect`.

```xml
<dependentAssembly>
  <assemblyIdentity name="System.Net.Http" publicKeyToken="b03f5f7f11d50a3a" culture="neutral" />
</dependentAssembly>
```

- Find the `assemblyIdentity` for `System.Net.Http` and lower the newVersion to `4.0.0.0`.

```xml
<dependentAssembly>
  <assemblyIdentity name="System.Net.Http" publicKeyToken="b03f5f7f11d50a3a" culture="neutral" />
  <bindingRedirect oldVersion="0.0.0.0-4.2.0.0" newVersion="4.0.0.0" />
</dependentAssembly>
```

- Install the latest package from `System.Net.Http` in NuGet into your project.

You can find more information about the problem [in this GitHub issue](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/24382).

### Tags Not Showing if Set on Application_Start

This happens because the `scope` from `requests` will be different from the one executed during the execution of Application_Start.
To apply `Tags` globally, it's recommended that you set them in `SentryOptions`, as shown in the example below:

```csharp
SentrySdk.Init(options =>
{
  options.Dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___";
  options.DefaultTags.Add("TagName", "value");
});
```
