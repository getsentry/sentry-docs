## Configuration Issues

### Proxy Server

Often, your server can only access the internet through a proxy server.
If that's the case, make sure your proxy server is listed in the `web.config` so the `HttpClient`
used by Sentry's SDK can pick it up.

```xml
<system.net>
    <defaultProxy>
      <proxy proxyaddress="http://proxy.address.here" bypassonlocal="true" />
    </defaultProxy>
</system.net>
```

### TLS 1.2 Support & Windows Server

If you're not able to capture events from ASP.NET to Sentry
on older versions of Windows Server, with the older .NET Framework, you must enable TLS 1.2.

```
using System.Net;

ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol = SecurityProtocolType.Tls12
```

### Tags not showing if set on Application_Start

That happens because the `scope` from `requests` will be different from the one executed during the execution of Application_Start.
To apply `Tags` globally. It's recommended to set them into SentryOptions as shown in the example below.

```csharp
SentrySdk.Init(options =>
{
  options.Dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___";
  options.DefaultTags.Add("TagName", "value");
});
```
