## Configuration Issues

### Proxy Server

Often, your server can only access the internet through a proxy server.
If that's the case, make sure your proxy server is listed in the `web.config` so the `HttpClient`
used by Sentry's SDK can pick it up.

```xml
<system.net>
    <defaultProxy>
      <proxy proxyaddress="http://proxy.address.here" bypassonlocal="true" />
    </defaultProxy>
</system.net>
```

### TLS 1.2 Support & Windows Server

If you're not able to capture events from ASP.NET to Sentry
on older versions of Windows Server, with the older .NET Framework, you must enable TLS 1.2.

```
using System.Net;

ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol = SecurityProtocolType.Tls12
```

### SentrSdk.Init with error

In case you receive the following error during Sentry initialization:

`System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Could not load file or assembly System.Net.Http, Version=4.0.0.0`

You may have a misconfiguration on your Web.config. You may fix it with one of the three solutions below:

* Find the `assemblyIdentity` for `System.Net.Http` and remove the `bindingRedirect`.
```xml
<dependentAssembly>
  <assemblyIdentity name="System.Net.Http" publicKeyToken="b03f5f7f11d50a3a" culture="neutral" />
</dependentAssembly>
```

* Find the `assemblyIdentity` for `System.Net.Http` and lower the newVersion to `4.0.0.0`
```xml
<dependentAssembly>
  <assemblyIdentity name="System.Net.Http" publicKeyToken="b03f5f7f11d50a3a" culture="neutral" />
  <bindingRedirect oldVersion="0.0.0.0-4.2.0.0" newVersion="4.0.0.0" />
</dependentAssembly>
```

* Install the latest package from `System.Net.Http` in NuGet into your project.
