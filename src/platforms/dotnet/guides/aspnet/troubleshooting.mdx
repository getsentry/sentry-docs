## Configuration Issues

### Proxy Server

Often, your server can only access the internet through a proxy server.
If that's the case, make sure your proxy server is listed in the `web.config` so the `HttpClient`
used by Sentry's SDK can pick it up.

```xml
<system.net>
    <defaultProxy>
      <proxy proxyaddress="http://proxy.address.here" bypassonlocal="true" />
    </defaultProxy>
</system.net>
```

### TLS 1.2 Support & Windows Server

If you're not able to capture events from ASP.NET to Sentry
on older versions of Windows Server, with the older .NET Framework, you must enable TLS 1.2.

```
using System.Net;

ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol = SecurityProtocolType.Tls12
```

### SentrSdk.Init with error

In case you receive the following error during Sentry initialization:

`System.IO.FileNotFoundException: 'Could not load file or assembly 'System.Net.Http, Version=4.0.0.0`

You may have a misconfiguration on your Web.config.
There are three ways of solving this.

1) find the `assemblyIdentity` for `System.Net.Http` and remove the `bindingRedirect`.
2) find the `assemblyIdentity` for `System.Net.Http` and lower the newVersion to `4.0.0.0`
3) Install the NuGet `System.Net.Http` with the latest version available for your project.
