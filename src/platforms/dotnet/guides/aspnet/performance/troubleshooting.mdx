## Transactions get grouped together as `GET /*/*.`

The SDK creates the transaction name as follows

```csharp
var method = httpContext.Request.HttpMethod;
var path = httpContext.Request.Path;

var transactionName = $"{method} {path}";

// Since the name is derived from the path and potentially contains identifiers it is marked as such
transactionContext.NameSource = TransactionNameSource.Url;
```

Since the `URL` might contain potential identifiers, such as `GET /users/123`, the backend tries to remove values with high variations. Leading it to `GET /users/*`. Sometimes, when there are many paths, it can result in `GET /*/*`.
It is possible to work around this and still rely on automatic performance instrumentation. You can access the currently active transaction and overwrite the `Name` and `NameSource`. Specifying the exact name of the transaction, without any variables. Using the example above, it would look like:

```csharp
if (SentrySdk.GetSpan()?.GetTransaction() is TransactionTracer transactionTracer)
{
    transactionTracer.NameSource = TransactionNameSource.Custom;
    transactionTracer.Name = "GET /users/{id}";
}

```
