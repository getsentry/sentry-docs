Sentry provides an integration with _ASP.NET_ through the [Sentry NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sentry).

## Install

Add the Sentry dependency:

```powershell {tabTitle:Package Manager}
Install-Package Sentry -Version {{ packages.version('sentry.dotnet') }}
```

```shell {tabTitle:.NET Core CLI}
dotnet add package Sentry -v {{ packages.version('sentry.dotnet') }}
```

You can combine this integration with a logging library like `log4net`, `NLog` or `Serilog` to include both request data
as well as your logs as breadcrumbs. The logging ingrations also capture events when an error is logged.

On top of that, I advise you update your app/server to run on a more current version of the .NET Framework. Specifically, the latest, .NET 4.7.2.

### Configuring

You configure the SDK in the `Global.asax.cs`:

```csharp

using Sentry;

public class MvcApplication : System.Web.HttpApplication
{
    private IDisposable _sentry;

    protected void Application_Start()
    {
        // Add this to Application_Start
        _sentry = SentrySdk.Init(o =>
        {
            o.Dsn = new Dsn("___PUBLIC_DSN___");
        });
    }

    protected void Application_Error()
    {
        var exception = Server.GetLastError();
        SentrySdk.CaptureException(exception);
    }

    protected void Application_End()
    {
        _sentry?.Dispose();
    }
}

```

### Capturing the affected user

When opting-in to [SendDefaultPii](#senddefaultpii), the SDK will automatically read the user from the request by inspecting `HttpContext.User`. Default claim values like `NameIdentifier` for the _Id_ will be used.

If you wish to change the behavior of how to read the user from the request, you can register a new `IUserFactory` into the container:

```csharp
SentrySdk.Init(o =>
{
  UserFactory = new MyUserFactory();
}
```

### SendDefaultPii

Although this setting is part of the [Sentry](/platforms/dotnet/) package, in the context of ASP.NET Core, it means reporting the user by reading the frameworks `HttpContext.User`. The strategy to create the `SentryUser` can be customized.

### IncludeRequestPayload

It's helpful to troubleshoot a problem in the API when the payload that hit the endpoint is logged.
Opt-in to send the request body to Sentry:

```csharp
SentrySdk.Init(o =>
{
  MaxRequestBodySize = RequestSize.Always;
}
```

### Proxy server

Often your server can only access the Internet through a proxy server.
If that's the case, make sure your proxy server is listed in the `web.config` so the `HttpClient`
used by Sentry's SDK can pick it up.

```xml
<system.net>
    <defaultProxy>
      <proxy proxyaddress="http://proxy.address.here" bypassonlocal="true" />
    </defaultProxy>
</system.net>
```

### TLS 1.2 Support and Windows Server

If you're not able to capture events from ASP.NET to Sentry,
on older versions of Windows Server, with older .NET Framework you must enable TLS 1.2.

```
ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol = SecurityProtocolType.Tls12
```
