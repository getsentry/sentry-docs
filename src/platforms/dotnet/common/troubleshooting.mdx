## Build Issues


### Package conflict - `Conflict with Sentry.DiagnosticsSource.`

```
The call is ambiguous between the following methods or properties: 
Sentry.SentryOptionsExtensions.DisableDiagnosticSourceIntegration(Sentry.SentryOptions) 
and Sentry.SentryOptionsDiagnosticExtensions.DisableDiagnosticSourceIntegration(Sentry.SentryOptions)
```

It means that the version of the Sentry package you are using already contains the `DiagnosticSource` integration within itself but you additionally installed `Sentry.DiagnosticSource` is only relevant for older framework versions.

To resolve this problem, remove the package reference to `Sentry.DiagnosticSource`.

### Missing Definition

`SentryOptions does not contain a definition for AddDiagnosticSourceIntegration.`

The above error could have two meanings:

* You're using an outdated SDK (3.8.3 or older).

* Your project already includes the integration automatically. You can validate it by observing the debug information from Sentry SDK. <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#debug">Enable it through the options.</PlatformLink>

Your debug window will have following messages:

```
  Debug: Logging enabled with ConsoleDiagnosticLogger and min level: Debug
  Debug: Initializing Hub for Dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___'.
  Debug: Using 'GzipBufferedRequestBodyHandler' body compression strategy with level Optimal.
  Debug: New scope pushed.
  Debug: Registering integration: 'AutoSessionTrackingIntegration'.
  Debug: Registering integration: 'AppDomainUnhandledExceptionIntegration'.
  Debug: Registering integration: 'AppDomainProcessExitIntegration'.
  Debug: Registering integration: 'TaskUnobservedTaskExceptionIntegration'.
  Debug: Registering integration: 'SentryDiagnosticListenerIntegration'.
```
If the debug file contains information about `SentryDiagnosticListenerIntegration`, then your project already includes the integration automatically.
