## Build Issues


### Package conflict - `Conflict with Sentry.DiagnosticsSource.`

```csharp
The call is ambiguous between the following methods or properties: Sentry.SentryOptionsExtensions.DisableDiagnosticSourceIntegration(Sentry.SentryOptions) and Sentry.SentryOptionsDiagnosticExtensions.DisableDiagnosticSourceIntegration(Sentry.SentryOptions)
```

It means that the version of the Sentry package you are using already contains the DiagnosticsSource integration within itself but you additionally installed `Sentry.DiagnosticsSource` is only relevant for older framework versions. To resolve this problem, remove the package reference to `Sentry.DiagnosticsSource`

### Missing definition - `SentryOptions does not contain a definition for AddDiagnosticSourceIntegration.`

The above error could have two meanings

* You're using an outdated SDK (3.8.3 or older).

* Your project already includes the integration automatically, you can validate it by observing the debug information from Sentry, for example:

```csharp
SentrySDK.Init(option =>{
    option.Dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    option.Debug = true;
    option.DiagnosticLevel = SentryLevel.Debug;    
});
```

By that you will observe in your debug window the following messages:

```
  Debug: Logging enabled with ConsoleDiagnosticLogger and min level: Debug
  Debug: Initializing Hub for Dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___'.
  Debug: Using 'GzipBufferedRequestBodyHandler' body compression strategy with level Optimal.
  Debug: New scope pushed.
  Debug: Registering integration: 'AutoSessionTrackingIntegration'.
  Debug: Registering integration: 'AppDomainUnhandledExceptionIntegration'.
  Debug: Registering integration: 'AppDomainProcessExitIntegration'.
  Debug: Registering integration: 'TaskUnobservedTaskExceptionIntegration'.
  Debug: Registering integration: 'SentryDiagnosticListenerIntegration'.
```
If you observe the debug information contains information about `SentryDiagnosticListenerIntegration` then your project already includes the integration automatically.
