## User IP address in Sentry shows up as the server IP

If you're using a proxy server that relies on `X-Forwarded-For`, you might need to [configure ASP.NET Core
so that it's aware of it](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/proxy-load-balancer).

See this [GitHub issue for more context](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/issues/258)
