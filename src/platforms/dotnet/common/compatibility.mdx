The Sentry .NET SDK directly targets the following platforms:

- .NET 5, and .NET 6
- Platform-specific versions of .NET 6 for Android, iOS, and MacCatalyst
- .NET Core 3.0
- .NET Standard 2.0 and 2.1
- .NET Framework 4.6.1

According to the [.NET Standard compatibility table](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/net-standard),
that means it should also work well with the following:

- Mono 5.4 and newer
- Xamarin.Android 8.0 and newer
- Xamarin.Mac 3.8 and newer
- Xamarin.iOS 10.14 and newer
- Universal Windows Platform 10.0.16299 and newer

<Note>

Though you can use the Sentry SDK in any of the above versions, some of those are no longer supported by Microsoft.
Thus, we recommend using Microsoft supported versions of each platform whenever possible.

- Most applications should use .NET version 6.0 or newer. See Microsoft's official [.NET Support Policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy) page for more details.
- Applications targeting .NET Framework should use version 4.6.2 or newer. See Microsoft's official [.NET Framework Support Policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-framework) page for more details.

</Note>

<Note>

If you're using an older version of .NET Framework or Mono, [our legacy SDK](/platforms/dotnet/legacy-sdk/) supports .NET Framework as early as 3.5.

## Unit Testing

To ensure a high degree of confidience, Sentry runs a comprehensive validation test suite for most SDK functionality.
Our tests are run targeting the following platforms:

- .NET 6 - Windows, macOS, and Linux
- .NET Core 3.1 - Windows, macOS, and Linux
- .NET Framework 4.8 - Windows
- Mono 6.12.0 - macOS and Linux
