You can ignore exceptions by their type when initializing the SDK:

```csharp
SentrySdk.Init(o => o.AddExceptionFilterForType<OperationCanceledException>());
```

```fsharp
SentrySdk.Init(fun o -> o.AddExceptionFilterForType<OperationCanceledException>())
```

It works in the whole inheritance chain.
The example above will also filter out `TaskCanceledException` because it derives from `OperationCanceledException`.
