The [Sentry CLI](/product/cli) provides many useful features.  For .NET, we can use it to upload [debug information files](/product/cli/dif) to Sentry,
such as .NET `PDB` symbol files.  This allows Sentry to show a more complete stack trace, including filenames and line numbers.

In the future, we may incorporate additional features of the Sentry CLI into the Sentry .NET SDK.

## Authentication

For this integration to work, you must authenticate to Sentry on the machine that is performing your release builds.

<Alert level="info" title="Important">

The Sentry auth token (or legacy API key) should always be treated as secret.  Be careful not to commit authentication information to source control,
or use it in any way that it would be written to log files.

</Alert>

Any of the authentication methods accepted by the Sentry CLI can be used.  See [Configuration and Authentication](/product/cli/configuration/).
However, we generally recommend the following:

- If building your releases on a developer workstation, [install the Sentry CLI](/product/cli/installation/) and then
  call `sentry-cli login` to use the [automatic configuration](/product/cli/configuration/#to-use-the-automatic-option) option.
  This will help you create an auth token and save it to the `~/.sentryclirc` file on the workstation.

- If building from a CI/CD server, use the secrets feature of your CI/CD platform to set the `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable.

  For example, if using GitHub Actions, first set an [encrypted secret](https://docs.github.com/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets)
  and then pass the secret as an environment variable to the step performing your build action.  (See [below](#environment-variables) for an example.)

  <Note>

  You do not need to separately install Sentry CLI on your build server, as it is already bundled with the nuget package.

  </Note>

## Configuration

In addition to authentication, you must provide your Sentry organization and project slugs.  These can be found in various places
from the Sentry UI, such as in the URL after selecting a project.

For example, if the project URL is `https://sentry.io/organizations/example-org/projects/example-project/?project=1234567`, then the org slug
is `example-org` and the project slug is `example-project`.

If you are self-hosting Sentry (rather than using sentry.io), then you will also need to provide the URL to your Sentry server.

These can be set in a variety of different ways, as described in the following sections.

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be set:

<ConfigKey name="SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN">

The authentication token for your Sentry account.  Should be kept secret.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="SENTRY_API_KEY">

The API key for your Sentry account, only if using legacy API keys.  (Prefer auth tokens.)  Should be kept secret.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="SENTRY_ORG">

The org slug for your Sentry account.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="SENTRY_PROJECT">

The project slug for the specific Sentry project you are using.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="SENTRY_URL">

The URL to your Sentry server, if self-hosted.  (Leave empty if using sentry.io.)

</ConfigKey>

<Alert title="Tip">

Environment variables are a good choice for configuring CI/CD environments.
Only the authentication information needs to be secret.
For example, if using GitHub Actions you can do the following:

```yaml
steps:
- name: Build
  run: dotnet build
  env:
    SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN }}
    SENTRY_ORG: ___ORG_SLUG___
    SENTRY_PROJ: ___PROJECT_SLUG___
```

</Alert>

### MSBuild Properties

If desired, you can choose to set your org and project slugs via MSBuild properties instead of environment variables.
(If _both_ are provided, MSBuild properties will take precedence.)

The following properties are available:

<ConfigKey name="SentryOrg">

The org slug for your Sentry account.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="SentryProject">

The project slug for the specific Sentry project you are using.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="SentryUrl">

The URL to your Sentry server, if self-hosted.  (Leave empty if using sentry.io.)

</ConfigKey>

<Alert level="info" title="Important">

There are two more properties, `SentryAuthToken` and `SentryApiKey`, that are available for authentication.
However we recommend that they are used only for simple testing, and not for production.  If you decide to use
them, be very careful that their values are not committed to source control or appear in build logs.
A more secure approach is to set authentication via environment variable or `~/.sentryclirc` file,

</Alert>

These can be set as properties in an MSBuild project file (`YourProject.csproj`, `YourProject.vbproj`, `Directory.Build.props`, etc.).  For example:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <SentryOrg>___ORG_SLUG___</SentryOrg>
  <SentryProject>___PROJECT_SLUG___</SentryProject>
</PropertyGroup>
```

They could also be passed as parameters when building your project.  For example:

```shell
dotnet build YourProject.csproj -c Release -p:SentryOrg=___ORG_SLUG___ -p:SentryProject=___PROJECT_SLUG___
```

<Alert title="Tip">

One reason to specify the org and project via properties is in the case where a solution has multiple
projects corresponding to separate Sentry projects.  In that case, each .NET project can specify its own
`SentryOrg` and `SentryProject` properties, or they can be set in [`Directory.Build.props`](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/msbuild/customize-your-build)
for more complex builds.

</Alert>

### Additonal MSBuild Properties

There are a few extra properties available to control the usage of the Sentry CLI integration:

<ConfigKey name="SentryUploadSymbols">

Controls uploading symbols to Sentry during the build.  Defaults to `true` for builds in release configuration,
or `false` otherwise.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="UseSentryCLI">

Controls whether the Sentry CLI integration is enabled.  `true` by default.
Set to `false` to disable the Sentry CLI integration completely, ignoring all other properties.

</ConfigKey>

<Note>

This list may be updated in the future, as new features are added.
