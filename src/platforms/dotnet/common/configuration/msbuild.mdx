The [Sentry CLI](/product/cli) has many useful features that can improve your Sentry experience.
For .NET, you can use it to upload [debug information files](/product/cli/dif), such as .NET `PDB` symbol files.
This allows Sentry to show a more complete stack trace, including file names and line numbers.
You can also use it to upload *source code*, which enables Sentry to display [source context](../../data-management/debug-files/source-context/)
when viewing stack traces.

While you can always run `sentry-cli` from the command line manually, we've made it easier by including it in the `Sentry`
NuGet package, and providing properties to enable it from your build.

## Authentication

For this feature to work, you must authenticate to Sentry on the machine that is performing your release builds.

<Alert level="info" title="Important">

The Sentry auth token (or legacy API key) should always be treated as secret.  Be careful not to commit authentication information to source control,
or use it in any way that it would be written to log files.

</Alert>

Any of the authentication methods accepted by the Sentry CLI can be used.  See [Configuration and Authentication](/product/cli/configuration/).
However, we generally recommend the following:

- If building your releases on a developer workstation, [install the Sentry CLI](/product/cli/installation/) and then
  call `sentry-cli login` to use the [automatic configuration](/product/cli/configuration/#to-use-the-automatic-option) option.
  This will help you create an auth token and save it to the `~/.sentryclirc` file on the workstation.

- If building from a CI/CD server, use the secrets feature of your CI/CD platform to set the `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable.

  For example, if using GitHub Actions, first set an [encrypted secret](https://docs.github.com/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets)
  and then pass the secret via the `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable to the step performing your build action.

  ```yaml
  steps:
  - name: Build
    run: dotnet build
    env:
      SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN }}
  ```

  You do not need to separately install Sentry CLI on your build server, as it is already provided by the Sentry NuGet package.


## Configuration

In addition to authentication, you must configure your Sentry organization and project slugs.
You may also want to configure other [optional properties](#optional-msbuild-properties).

The slugs can be found in various places from the Sentry UI, such as in the URL after selecting a project.
For example, if the project URL is `https://sentry.io/organizations/example-org/projects/example-project/?project=1234567`,
then the organization slug is `example-org` and the project slug is `example-project`.

If you are self-hosting Sentry (rather than using sentry.io), then you will also need to provide the URL to your Sentry server.

<Alert title="Tip">

Any of the [Sentry CLI configuration values](/product/cli/configuration/#configuration-values) can be set via environment variables
or in configuration files, such as shown in the above authentication steps.

However, other than authentication, you should consider setting configuration values via the MSBuild properties described below,
such that they are part of your code that is commited to source control.  This allows them to be consistent across environments,
and also allows the settings to differ per each project in your solution, if desired.

If _both_ MSBuild properties and environment variables are provided, the MSBuild properties will take precedence.

</Alert>

### Setting MSBuild Properties

MSBuild properties can be set in any MSBuild project file, such as those that are created by Visual Studio or the `dotnet` CLI
(`YourProject.csproj`, `YourProject.vbproj`, `Directory.Build.props`, etc.).

You can add Sentry's MSBuild properties to any property group. For example:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <SentryOrg>___ORG_SLUG___</SentryOrg>
  <SentryProject>___PROJECT_SLUG___</SentryProject>
  <SentryUploadSources>true</SentryUploadSources>
</PropertyGroup>
```

Alternatively, they could be passed as parameters when building your project.  For example:

```shell
dotnet build YourProject.csproj -c Release -p:SentryOrg=___ORG_SLUG___ -p:SentryProject=___PROJECT_SLUG___ -p:SentryUploadSources=true
```

<Alert title="Tip">

In a solution with multiple projects, you may have properties that are the same across multiple projects.
Consider placing these properties in a [`Directory.Build.props`](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/msbuild/customize-your-build)
file, so that they are shared with all projects in your solution.

</Alert>

### Required MSBuild Properties

The following MSBuild properties will pass required information to the Sentry CLI:

<ConfigKey name="SentryOrg">

The organization slug for your Sentry account.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="SentryProject">

The project slug for the specific Sentry project you are using.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="SentryUrl">

The URL to your Sentry server.  Required only if self-hosting Sentry.  (Do not use with sentry.io.)

</ConfigKey>

### Optional MSBuild Properties

There are a few additional properties available to control the Sentry CLI:

<ConfigKey name="SentryUploadSymbols">

Controls uploading symbols to Sentry during the build.  Defaults to `true` for builds in release configuration,
or `false` otherwise.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="SentryUploadSources">

Controls whether source code files are uploaded to Sentry during the build.  Defaults to `false`.

Set this property to `true` to opt-in to enable [source context](../../data-management/debug-files/source-context/) when viewing stack traces.

<Note>

If you are already embedding source code in your symbol files using [`EmbedAllSources`](https://github.com/dotnet/sourcelink/blob/main/docs/README.md#embedallsources),
you do not need to upload them to Sentry separately.  In other words, use *either* `SentryUploadSources` or `EmbedAllSources`, not both.

</Note>

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="SentryIncludeIntermediateOutputPath">

When uploading symbols, the `bin` folder of each project is always searched for debug information files.
Set this option to `true` to also search the `obj` folder.  Defaults to `false`.

<Note>

For some application types, such as those that use AOT compilation, this will collect significantly more
files than you may expect.  Typically, these files are not needed for symbolication, but can add additional
information for *native* crashes.

</Note>

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="UseSentryCLI">

Controls whether the Sentry CLI is enabled in your build.  `true` by default.
Set to `false` to disable the Sentry CLI completely, ignoring all other properties.

</ConfigKey>

<Alert level="info" title="Important">

There are two more properties, `SentryAuthToken` and `SentryApiKey`, that are available for authentication.
However we recommend that they are used only for simple testing, and not for production.  If you decide to use
them, be very careful that their values are not committed to source control or appear in build logs.
A more secure approach is to set authentication via environment variable or `~/.sentryclirc` file,
