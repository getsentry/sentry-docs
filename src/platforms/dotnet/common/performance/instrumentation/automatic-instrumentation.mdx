### Propagating a trace

<Note>

If you are using Sentry's ASP.NET Core integration, trace propagation is enabled automatically on all clients created by an HTTP client factory. Read more about it <Link to="/platforms/dotnet/guides/aspnetcore/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation">here</Link>.

</Note>

Sentry SDK provides a custom HTTP handler, `SentryHttpMessageHandler`. This handler can be used inside `HttpClient` to automatically propagate traces and create spans to track outgoing requests.

To use it, create an instance of `HttpClient` by passing an instance of `SentryHttpMessageHandler` as a constructor parameter:

```csharp
var httpHandler = new SentryHttpMessageHandler();
var httpClient = new HttpClient(httpHandler);

var response = await httpClient.GetStringAsync("https://example.com");
```

Upon sending a request to `https://example.com`, the instrumented HTTP client will:

- Populate the `sentry-trace` header on the request. This allows peer service to start a transaction by linking it to the current (assuming it's also instrumented with Sentry).
- Start a span named `GET https://example.com` which will track the corresponding HTTP operation on the current transaction.

Additionally, `SentryHttpMessageHandler` also inherits from `DelegatingHandler` which allows you to chain it together with other handlers. For example:

```csharp
var innerHttpHandler = new HttpClientHandler();
var sentryHttpHandler = new SentryHttpMessageHandler(innerHttpHandler);
var httpClient = new HttpClient(sentryHttpHandler);
```

## DiagnosticSource Integration

Starting with version 3.9.0, the SDK will automatically integrate with Entity Framework Core and SQLClient whenever available. Those integrations will automatically be activated if your project matches one of the following conditions:
* Includes `Sentry.AspNet` 3.9.0 or higher
* Includes `Sentry.AspNetCore` 3.9.0 or higher
* Targets .NET Core 3.0 or higher (for example .NET 5)

Even if your project doesn't meet any of those requirements, you'll be able to manually activate those instrumentations by including the package 'Sentry.DiagnosticSource' and enabling it during on the SDK's initialization.

```csharp
// Requires NuGet package: Sentry.DiagnosticSource
option.AddDiagnosticListeners();

```

If you don't want to have this integration, you can disable it on `SentryOptions` by calling `DisableDiagnosticListenerIntegration();`
```csharp
option.DisableDiagnosticListenerIntegration();
```
