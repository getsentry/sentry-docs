### Propagating a trace

<Note>

If you are using Sentry's ASP.NET Core integration, trace propagation is enabled automatically on all clients created by an HTTP client factory. Read more about it <Link to="/platforms/dotnet/guides/aspnetcore/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation">here</Link>.

</Note>

Sentry SDK provides a custom HTTP handler, `SentryHttpMessageHandler`. This handler can be used inside `HttpClient` to automatically propagate traces and create spans to track outgoing requests.

To use it, create an instance of `HttpClient` by passing an instance of `SentryHttpMessageHandler` as a constructor parameter:

```csharp
var httpHandler = new SentryHttpMessageHandler();
var httpClient = new HttpClient(httpHandler);

var response = await httpClient.GetStringAsync("https://example.com");
```

Upon sending a request to `https://example.com`, the instrumented HTTP client will:

- Populate the `sentry-trace` header on the request. This allows peer service to start a transaction by linking it to the current (assuming it's also instrumented with Sentry).
- Start a span named `GET https://example.com` which will track the corresponding HTTP operation on the current transaction.

Additionally, `SentryHttpMessageHandler` also inherits from `DelegatingHandler` which allows you to chain it together with other handlers. For example:

```csharp
var innerHttpHandler = new HttpClientHandler();
var sentryHttpHandler = new SentryHttpMessageHandler(innerHttpHandler);
var httpClient = new HttpClient(sentryHttpHandler);
```
