According to this [compatibility table](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard), the package is compatible with the following versions or newer:

- .NET Framework 4.6.1
- .NET Core 2.0
- Mono 5.4
- Xamarin.Android 8.0
- Xamarin.Mac 3.8
- Xamarin.iOS 10.14
- Universal Windows Platform 10.0.16299

## Unit Testing

We run our unit/integration tests against:

- .NET 5 - Windows, macOS, and Linux
- .NET Core 3.1 - Windows, macOS, and Linux
- .NET Core 2.1 - Windows, macOS, and Linux
- .NET Framework 4.8 - Windows
- Mono 5.12 - macOS and Linux

<Note>

If you're using an older version of .NET Framework or Mono, [our legacy SDK](/clients/csharp/) supports .NET Framework as early as 3.5.

</Note>

We often don't want to couple our code with a static class like `SentrySdk`. Especially to allow our code to be testable.
If that's your case, you can use 2 abstractions:

- `ISentryClient`
- `IHub`

The `ISentryClient` exposes the `CaptureEvent` method and its implementation `SentryClient` is responsible for queueing the event to be sent to Sentry. It also abstracts away the internal transport.

The `IHub` on the other hand, holds a client and the current [scope](../enriching-events/scopes/). In fact, it extends `ISentryClient` and is able to dispatch calls to the right client depending on the current scope.

In order to allow different events to hold different contextual data, you need to know in which scope you are in.
That's the job of the [`Hub`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/blob/master/src/Sentry/Internal/Hub.cs). It holds the scope management as well as a client.

If all you are doing is sending events, without modification/access to the current scope, then you depend on `ISentryClient`. If on the other hand you would like to have access to the current scope by configuring it or binding a different client to it, you depend on `IHub`.

An example using `IHub` for testability is [SentryLogger](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/blob/master/src/Sentry.Extensions.Logging/SentryLogger.cs) and its unit tests [SentryLoggerTests](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/blob/master/test/Sentry.Extensions.Logging.Tests/SentryLoggerTests.cs).
`SentryLogger` depends on `IHub` because it does modify the scope (through `AddBreadcrumb`). In case it only sent events, it should instead depend on `ISentryClient`
