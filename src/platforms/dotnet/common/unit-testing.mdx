If you don't want to couple your code with a static class like `SentrySdk`, especially to allow your code to be testable, you can use two abstractions:

- `ISentryClient`: exposes the `CaptureEvent` method and its implementation `SentryClient` is responsible for queueing the event to be sent to Sentry. It also abstracts away the internal transport.
- `IHub`: holds a client and the current [scope](../enriching-events/scopes/). In fact, it extends `ISentryClient` and is able to dispatch calls to the right client depending on the current scope.

To allow different events to hold different contextual data, you need to know in which scope you are in, which is managed by the [`Hub`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/blob/master/src/Sentry/Internal/Hub.cs). It holds the scope management as well as a client.

If all you are only sending events without modification/access to the current scope, then you depend on `ISentryClient`. If you would like to have access to the current scope by configuring it or binding a different client to it, you depend on `IHub`.

An example using `IHub` for testability is [SentryLogger](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/blob/master/src/Sentry.Extensions.Logging/SentryLogger.cs) and its unit tests [SentryLoggerTests](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/blob/master/test/Sentry.Extensions.Logging.Tests/SentryLoggerTests.cs).
`SentryLogger` depends on `IHub` because it does modify the scope (through `AddBreadcrumb`). In case it only sent events, it should instead depend on `ISentryClient`
