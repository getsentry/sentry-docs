title: Releases

The SDK attempts to locate the release to add that to the events sent to Sentry.

> [Default values like 1.0 or 1.0.0.0 are ignored](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/blob/dbb5a3af054d0ca6f801de37fb7db3632ca2c65a/src/Sentry/Internal/ApplicationVersionLocator.cs#L14-L21).

The SDK will firstly look at the [entry assembly's](<https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.assembly.getentryassembly(v=vs.110).aspx>) `AssemblyInformationalVersionAttribute`, which accepts a string as
value and is often used to set a GIT commit hash.

If that returns null, it'll look at the default `AssemblyVersionAttribute` which accepts the numeric version number. When creating a project with Visual Studio, the value is set to _1.0.0.0_.
Since that usually means that the version is either not being set, or is set via a different method. The **automatic version detection will disregard** this value and no _Release_ will be reported automatically.
