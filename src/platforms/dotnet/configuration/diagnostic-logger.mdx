Sentry's SDK includes its own internal logger to report diagnostics that may be useful when troubleshooting your Sentry configuration. To enable logging, set the `Debug` option to `true`:

```csharp
options =>
{
    options.Dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___";

    // Enable debug mode to write diagnostic messages
    options.Debug = true;
    // By default it's already the most verbose level: Debug
    // You can use this make this less noisy by changing it to
    // a less verbose level such as `Information` or `Warning`.
    options.DiagnosticLevel = SentryLevel.Debug;
});
```

## Customize Implementation

By default, Sentry will write diagnostic messages to console. This may not be optimal in some circumstances; for example, when running applications that don't have a visible console window attached.

To use a custom implementation of `IDiagnosticLogger`, you can pass it to the `DiagnosticLogger` option. Sentry comes with two implementations out of the box: `ConsoleDiagnosticLogger` and `DebugDiagnosticLogger`.

```csharp
// Provide a custom logger
options.DiagnosticLogger = new DebugDiagnosticLogger(SentryLevel.Debug);
```

The logger `DebugDiagnosticLogger` in the example uses the [.NET's Debug class](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.debug). As a result, you can view the SDK logs inside Visual Studio's Debug log window, which is useful for technologies that don't have a Console to see the log messages, such as `WPF` and `ASP.NET`.

You can also create your own implementation of `IDiagnosticLogger` to fully customize logging behavior. For example, to naively append diagnostic messages to a file:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Globalization;
using System.IO;
using Sentry.Extensibility;
using Sentry.Protocol;

public class FileAppenderDiagnosticLogger : IDiagnosticLogger, IDisposable
{
    private readonly StreamWriter _writer;
    private readonly SentryLevel _minimalLevel;

    public FileAppenderDiagnosticLogger(string filePath, SentryLevel minimalLevel)
    {
        _writer = new StreamWriter(filePath);
        _minimalLevel = minimalLevel;
    }

    public bool IsEnabled(SentryLevel level) => level >= _minimalLevel;

    public void Log(SentryLevel logLevel, string message, Exception exception = null, params object[] args)
    {
        lock (_writer)
        {
            _writer.Write("{0} - {1}: ", DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.ToString("yyyy-MM-ddTHH\\:mm\\:ss.ffffZ", DateTimeFormatInfo.InvariantInfo), logLevel);
            _writer.Write("");
            _writer.Write(message, args);
            if (exception is Exception)
            {
                _writer.Write("Exception: ");
                _writer.Write(exception);
            }
            _writer.WriteLine();
            _writer.Flush();
        }
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        lock (_writer)
        {
            _writer.Dispose();
        }
    }
}
```
<Note>

For a production environment you'd want to extend this so the file doesn't grow indefinitely and is eventually rotated to avoid filling up the disk space.
