With [profiling](/product/profiling/), Sentry allows you to collect and analyze performance profiles from real user devices in production to give you a complete picture of how your application performs in a variety of environments.

<Note>

.NET profiling alpha is available for:
- .NET 6.0 and above for Windows, Linux and macOS using [.NET Core CLR Diagnostics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/diagnostics/diagnostics-client-library)
- .NET 6.0 and above for iOS and macCatalyst using native profiling support in [Sentry Apple SDK](/platforms/apple/)

.NET profiling is currently **not** available for:
- NativeAOT
- .NET Framework
- Android

</Note>

## Enable Performance Monitoring

Profiling depends on Sentryâ€™s performance monitoring product being enabled beforehand. To enable performance monitoring in the SDK, set the `TracesSampleRate` option to the desired value.

```csharp
using Sentry;

SentrySdk.Init(options =>
{
    // ... usual setup options omitted for clarity (see Getting Started) ...
    
    // Sample rate for your transactions, e.g. value 0.1 means we want to report 10% of transactions.
    options.TracesSampleRate = 0.1;
});
```

## Enable Profiling

To enable profiling, set the `ProfilesSampleRate`. 
Additionally, for all platforms except iOS/macCatalyst, you need to add a dependency on the `Sentry.Profiling` NuGet package.

```csharp {tabTitle:iOS/macCatalyst}
using Sentry;

SentrySdk.Init(options =>
{
    // ... usual setup options omitted for clarity (see Getting Started) ...
    
    // Sample rate for your transactions, e.g. value 0.1 means we want to report 10% of transactions.
    options.TracesSampleRate = 0.1;
    
    // Sample rate for profiling, applied on top of othe TracesSampleRate, 
    // e.g. 0.2 means we want to profile 20 % of the captured transactions, i.e. 2 % of all transactions.
    options.ProfilesSampleRate = 0.2;
});
```

```csharp {tabTitle:Windows/Linux/macOS}
using Sentry;

SentrySdk.Init(options =>
{
    // ... usual setup options omitted for clarity (see Getting Started) ...
    
    // Sample rate for your transactions, e.g. value 0.1 means we want to report 10% of transactions.
    options.TracesSampleRate = 0.1;
    
    // Sample rate for profiling, applied on top of othe TracesSampleRate, 
    // e.g. 0.2 means we want to profile 20 % of the captured transactions, i.e. 2 % of all transactions.
    options.ProfilesSampleRate = 0.2;
    
    // Requires NuGet package: Sentry.Profiling
    // Note: by default, the profiler is initialized asynchronously, this can be tuned by passing an desired initialization timeout to the constructor.
    options.AddIntegration(new ProfilingIntegration());
});
```

### 

Check out the <PlatformLink to="/performance/">performance setup documentation</PlatformLink> for more detailed information on how to configure sampling. 
Setting the traces sample rate to 1.0 means all transactions will be captured.
Setting the profiles sample rate to 1.0 means all captured transactions will be profiled.
