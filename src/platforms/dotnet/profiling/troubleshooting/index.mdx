### Profiles are not showing up

If you don't see any profiling data in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io), you can try the following:

- Ensure that performance monitoring <PlatformLink to="/performance/">is enabled</PlatformLink>.
- Ensure that the automatic instrumentation is sending performance data to Sentry by going to the **Performance** page in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).
- If the automatic instrumentation is not sending performance data, try using <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation">custom instrumentation</PlatformLink>.
- Enable <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#debug">debug mode</PlatformLink> in the SDK and check the logs.
- If the transactions happen too soon after `Sentry.Init()`, they may not be captured yet. 
  This is because the `ProfilingIntegration()` from `Sentry.Profiling` NuGet package initializes asynchronously by default. 
  If you'd like to initialize it synchronously, set the desired timeout constructor argument.
  Note: this doesn't apply to iOS/macCatalyst whic use native profiling and are initialized synchronously.

### Supported platforms

.NET profiling alpha is available for:
- .NET 6.0 and above for Windows, Linux and macOS using [.NET Core CLR Diagnostics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/diagnostics/diagnostics-client-library)
- .NET 6.0 and above for iOS and macCatalyst using native profiling support in [Sentry Apple SDK](/platforms/apple/)

.NET profiling is currently **not** available for:
- NativeAOT
- .NET Framework
- Android

### `Unknown` frames

Some frames will show up as `unknown` in the UI. This is because the SDK does not have information about the stack frame. 
Usually, these are anonymous helper JIT-generated methods and present among `System` stack frames.
