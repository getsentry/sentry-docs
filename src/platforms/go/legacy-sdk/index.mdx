<Alert level="warning" title="Deprecation Warning">

A [new Go SDK](/platforms/go/) has superseded this deprecated version. Sentry preserves this documentation for customers using the old `raven-go` client. Learn more about the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go) and check out our [migration guide](/platforms/go/migration/).

</Alert>

Raven-Go provides a Sentry client implementation for the Go programming language.

## Getting Started

Getting started with Sentry is a three step process:

1.  [Sign up for an account](https://sentry.io/signup/)
2.  [Install your SDK](#install)
3.  [Configure it](#configure)

## Installation {#install}

Raven-Go can be installed like any other Go library through `go get`:

```bash
go get github.com/getsentry/raven-go
```

## Configuration {#configure}

To use `raven-go`, youâ€™ll need to import the `raven` package, then initialize your DSN globally. If you specify the `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable, this will be done automatically for you. The release and environment can also be specified in the environment variables `SENTRY_RELEASE` and `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` respectively.
More on this in [Configuration](/platforms/go/legacy-sdk/config/) section.

<SignInNote />

```go
package main

import "github.com/getsentry/raven-go"

func init() {
	raven.SetDSN("___PUBLIC_DSN___")
}
```
