## Missing Stack Trace

Since the Go SDK tries to read the source files from your local disk, it's possible that you’re compiling your binary and deploying it in a manner that makes the source code inaccessible. 

This is common in Go because you can compile the binary, and then have no more need for the source code. Without access to the source code, however, we can’t map anything back, and we don’t support uploading Go source code with a release to stitch this data on.
