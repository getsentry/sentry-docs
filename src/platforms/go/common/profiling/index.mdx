With [profiling](/product/profiling/), Sentry allows you to collect and analyze performance profiles from real user devices in production to give you a complete picture of how your application performs in a variety of environments.

## Enable Performance Monitoring

Profiling depends on Sentryâ€™s performance monitoring product being enabled beforehand. To enable performance monitoring in the SDK:

<SignInNote />

```go
err := sentry.Init(sentry.ClientOptions{
	Dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
	EnableTracing: true,
	// We recommend adjusting this value in production:
	TracesSampleRate: 1.0,
})
```

Check out the <PlatformLink to="/performance/">performance setup documentation</PlatformLink> for more detailed information on how to configure sampling. Setting the sample rate to 1.0 means all transactions will be captured.

## Enable Profiling

<Note>

Go Profiling alpha is available since SDK version `0.22.0`.

</Note>

To enable profiling, set the `ProfilesSampleRate`:

<SignInNote />

```go
err := sentry.Init(sentry.ClientOptions{
	Dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
	EnableTracing: true,
	// We recommend adjusting these values in production:
	TracesSampleRate: 1.0,
	// The sampling rate for profiling is relative to TracesSampleRate:
	ProfilesSampleRate: 1.0,
})
```
