description: "Learn how to troubleshoot your profiling setup."

If you don't see any profiling data in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io), you can try the following:

- Ensure that performance monitoring <PlatformLink to="/performance/">is enabled</PlatformLink>.
- Ensure that the automatic instrumentation is sending performance data to Sentry by going to the **Performance** page in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).
- If the automatic instrumentation is not sending performance data, try using <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation">custom instrumentation</PlatformLink>.
- Enable <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#debug">debug mode</PlatformLink> in the SDK and check the logs.

### Limitations

Profile samples are collected periodically for each goroutine.
If your program uses a large number of concurrent goroutines, make sure to check whether the overhead is within the acceptable range for your use case.

As always, and especially with Profiling in Go being an alpha feature, feedback is welcome on [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/621778831602221064/621786587939864586) or [GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/issues/630).

### Limitations

Profiles for multi-threaded servers like `puma` might not capture frames correctly when async I/O is happening. This is a limitation of `stackprof`.

<PlatformSection supported={["react-native"]}>

### Limitations

Because profile samples are collected at a fixed sampling frequency, we recommend checking if profiling's [Performance Overhead](/product/profiling/performance-overhead) is acceptable for your use case. Note that
we're working on symbolication of the collected profiles which means that at the moment you'll see only function names but not resolved source file paths.

As always, and especially since Profiling in React Native is an alpha feature, feedback is welcome on [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/621778831602221064/750735628932612096) or [GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-react-native/issues/2668).
