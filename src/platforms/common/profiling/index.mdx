With [profiling](/product/profiling/), Sentry allows you to collect and analyze performance profiles from real user devices in production to give you a complete picture of how your application performs in a variety of environments.

## Enable Performance Monitoring

Profiling depends on Sentry’s performance monitoring product being enabled beforehand. To enable performance monitoring in the SDK:

<PlatformSection supported={["apple"]}>

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___DSN___"
    options.tracesSampleRate = 1.0
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___DSN___";
    options.tracesSampleRate = @1.0;
}];
```

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["android"]}>

In `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<application>
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.dsn" android:value="___DSN___" />
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.traces.sample-rate" android:value="1.0" />
</application>
```

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["react-native"]}>

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___DSN___",
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["go"]}>

```go
err := sentry.Init(sentry.ClientOptions{
	Dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
	EnableTracing: true,
	// We recommend adjusting this value in production:
	TracesSampleRate: 1.0,
})
```

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["python"]}>

```python
sentry_sdk.init(
  dsn="___DSN___",
  traces_sample_rate=1.0,
)
```

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["ruby"]}>

```ruby
Sentry.init do |config|
  config.dsn = '___PUBLIC_DSN___'
  config.traces_sample_rate = 1.0
end
```

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["rust"]}>

```rust
sentry::init((
    "___DSN___",
    sentry::ClientOptions {
        release: sentry::release_name!(),
        traces_sample_rate: 1.0,
        ..Default::default()
    },
));
```

</PlatformSection>

Check out the <PlatformLink to="/performance/">performance setup documentation</PlatformLink> for more detailed information on how to configure sampling. Setting the sample rate to 1.0 means all transactions will be captured.

<PlatformSection supported={["apple", "android"]}>

By default, some transactions will be created automatically for common operations like loading a view controller/activity and app startup.

</PlatformSection>

## Enable Profiling

<PlatformSection supported={["apple"]}>

<Note>

iOS profiling is available starting in SDK version `8.3.1`.

</Note>

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___DSN___"
    options.tracesSampleRate = 1.0 // tracing must be enabled for profiling
    options.profilesSampleRate = 1.0 // see also `profilesSampler` if you need custom sampling logic
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___DSN___";
    options.tracesSampleRate = @1.0; // tracing must be enabled for profiling
    options.profilesSampleRate = @1.0; // see also `profilesSampler` if you need custom sampling logic
}];
```

<Note>

The <PlatformIdentifier name="profiles-sample-rate" /> setting is _relative_ to the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> setting.

</Note>

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["android"]}>

<Note>

Android profiling is available starting in SDK version `6.16.0`.

</Note>

In `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<application>
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.dsn" android:value="___DSN___" />
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.traces.sample-rate" android:value="1.0" />
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.traces.profiling.sample-rate" android:value="1.0" />
</application>
```

<Note>

The `io.sentry.traces.profiling.sample-rate` setting is _relative_ to the `io.sentry.traces.sample-rate` setting.

</Note>

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["python"]}>

<Note>

Python profiling is available starting in SDK version `1.18.0`.

</Note>

```python
import sentry_sdk

def profiles_sampler(sampling_context):
    # ...
    # return a number between 0 and 1 or a boolean

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___DSN___",
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,

    # To set a uniform sample rate
    # Set profiles_sample_rate to 1.0 to profile 100%
    # of sampled transactions.
    # We recommend adjusting this value in production,
    profiles_sample_rate=1.0,

    # Alternatively, to control sampling dynamically
    profiles_sampler=profiles_sampler
)
```

<Note>

The <PlatformIdentifier name="profiles_sample_rate" /> setting is _relative_ to the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces_sample_rate" /> setting.

</Note>

### Upgrading from older SDK versions

The feature was experimental prior to version `1.17.0`. To update to the latest SDK, remove `profiles_sample_rate` from `_experiments` and set it in the top-level options.

```python
sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___DSN___",
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
    _experiments={
      "profiles_sample_rate": 1.0,  # for versions before 1.17.0
    },
)
```

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["react-native"]}>

<Note>

Profiling for React Native is available in alpha in SDK versions `5.7.0` and above.

</Note>

To enable profiling, set the `profilesSampleRate`:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___DSN___",
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  _experiments: {
    // profilesSampleRate is relative to tracesSampleRate.
    // Here, we'll capture profiles for 100% of transactions.
    profilesSampleRate: 1.0,
  },
});
```

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["go"]}>

<Note>

Go Profiling alpha is available since SDK version `0.22.0`.

</Note>

To enable profiling, set the `ProfilesSampleRate`:

```go
err := sentry.Init(sentry.ClientOptions{
	Dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
	EnableTracing: true,
	// We recommend adjusting these values in production:
	TracesSampleRate: 1.0,
	// The sampling rate for profiling is relative to TracesSampleRate:
	ProfilesSampleRate: 1.0,
})
```

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["ruby"]}>

<Note>

Ruby profiling beta is available starting in SDK version `5.9.0`.

</Note>

We use the [`stackprof` gem](https://github.com/tmm1/stackprof) to collect profiles for Ruby.

First add `stackprof` to your `Gemfile` and make sure it is loaded before `sentry-ruby`.

```ruby
# Gemfile

gem 'stackprof'
gem 'sentry-ruby'
```

Then, make sure both `traces_sample_rate` and `profiles_sample_rate` are set and non-zero in your sentry initializer.

```ruby
# config/initializers/sentry.rb

Sentry.init do |config|
  config.dsn = "___DSN___"
  config.traces_sample_rate = 1.0
  config.profiles_sample_rate = 1.0
end
```

<Note>

The <PlatformIdentifier name="profiles_sample_rate" /> setting is _relative_ to the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces_sample_rate" /> setting.

</Note>

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["rust"]}>

<Note>

Rust Profiling alpha is available starting in SDK version `0.29.0`.

</Note>

In order to use Profiling, you first need to enable the `profiling` feature in the `sentry` dependency inside the project `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
sentry = { version = "{{@inject packages.version('sentry.rust') }}", features = ["profiling"] }
```

Once you've completed the step above, you can proceed by enabling it in the SDK:

```rust
sentry::init((
    "___DSN___",
    sentry::ClientOptions {
        release: sentry::release_name!(),
        traces_sample_rate: 1.0,
        enable_profiling: true,
        profiles_sample_rate: 1.0,
        ..Default::default()
    },
));
```

<Note>

The <PlatformIdentifier name="profiles_sample_rate" /> setting is _relative_ to the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces_sample_rate" /> setting.

</Note>

</PlatformSection>

## Troubleshooting

If you don't see any profiling data in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io), you can try the following:

- Ensure that performance monitoring <PlatformLink to="/performance/">is enabled</PlatformLink>.
- Ensure that the automatic instrumentation is sending performance data to Sentry by going to the **Performance** page in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).
- If the automatic instrumentation is not sending performance data, try using <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation">custom instrumentation</PlatformLink>.
- Enable <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#debug">debug mode</PlatformLink> in the SDK and check the logs.

<PlatformSection supported={["react-native"]}>

### Limitations

Profile samples are collected at a fixed sampling frequency. We recommend checking if profiling's [Performance Overhead](/product/profiling/performance-overhead) is acceptable for your use case.

We are working on symbolication of the collected profiles. Out of the box, you will see function names.

As always, and especially since Profiling in React Native is an alpha feature, feedback is welcome on [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/621778831602221064/750735628932612096) or [GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-react-native/issues/2668).

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["go"]}>

### Limitations

Profile samples are collected periodically for each goroutine.
If your program uses a large number of concurrent goroutines, make sure to check whether the overhead is within the acceptable range for your use case.

As always, and especially with Profiling in Go being an alpha feature, feedback is welcome on [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/621778831602221064/621786587939864586) or [GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/issues/630).

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["ruby"]}>

### Limitations

Profiles for multi-threaded servers like `puma` might not capture frames correctly when async I/O is happening. This is a limitation of `stackprof`.
