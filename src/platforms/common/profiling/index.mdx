<Note>

The beta program for Profiling is now closed, but Profiling will become generally available soon. If you weren't part of the beta program, any Profiles sent during this time won't appear in your dashboard.

<Note>

Ruby Profiling is currently in beta. Beta features are still in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.

Rust Profiling is currently in alpha. Alpha features are still in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.

With [profiling](/product/profiling/), Sentry allows you to collect and analyze performance profiles from real user devices in production to give you a complete picture of how your application performs in a variety of environments.

## Enable Performance Monitoring

Profiling depends on Sentryâ€™s performance monitoring product being enabled beforehand. To enable performance monitoring in the SDK:

<PlatformSection supported={["apple"]}>

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___DSN___"
    options.tracesSampleRate = 1.0
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___DSN___";
    options.tracesSampleRate = @1.0;
}];
```

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["android"]}>

In `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<application>
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.dsn" android:value="___DSN___" />
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.traces.sample-rate" android:value="1.0" />
</application>
```

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["python"]}>

```python
sentry_sdk.init(
  dsn="___DSN___",
  traces_sample_rate=1.0,
)
```

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["ruby"]}>

```ruby
Sentry.init do |config|
  config.dsn = '___PUBLIC_DSN___'
  config.traces_sample_rate = 1.0
end
```

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["rust"]}>

```rust
sentry::init((
    "___DSN___",
    sentry::ClientOptions {
        release: sentry::release_name!(),
        traces_sample_rate: 1.0,
        ..Default::default()
    },
));
```

</PlatformSection>

Check out the <PlatformLink to="/performance/">performance setup documentation</PlatformLink> for more detailed information on how to configure sampling. Setting the sample rate to 1.0 means all transactions will be captured. By default, some transactions will be created automatically for common operations like loading a view controller/activity and app startup.

## Enable Profiling

<PlatformSection supported={["apple"]}>

<Note>

iOS profiling is available starting in SDK version `8.3.1`.

</Note>

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___DSN___"
    options.tracesSampleRate = 1.0 // tracing must be enabled for profiling
    options.profilesSampleRate = 1.0 // see also `profilesSampler` if you need custom sampling logic
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___DSN___";
    options.tracesSampleRate = @1.0; // tracing must be enabled for profiling
    options.profilesSampleRate = @1.0; // see also `profilesSampler` if you need custom sampling logic
}];
```

<Note>

The <PlatformIdentifier name="profiles-sample-rate" /> setting is _relative_ to the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> setting.

</Note>

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["android"]}>

<Note>

Android profiling is available starting in SDK version `6.16.0`.

</Note>

In `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<application>
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.dsn" android:value="___DSN___" />
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.traces.sample-rate" android:value="1.0" />
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.traces.profiling.sample-rate" android:value="1.0" />
</application>
```

<Note>

The `io.sentry.traces.profiling.sample-rate` setting is _relative_ to the `io.sentry.traces.sample-rate` setting.

</Note>

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["python"]}>

<Note>

Python profiling is available starting in SDK version `1.18.0`.

</Note>

```python
import sentry_sdk

def profiles_sampler(sampling_context):
    # ...
    # return a number between 0 and 1 or a boolean

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___DSN___",
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,

    # To set a uniform sample rate
    # Set profiles_sample_rate to 1.0 to profile 100%
    # of sampled transactions.
    # We recommend adjusting this value in production,
    profiles_sample_rate=1.0,

    # Alternatively, to control sampling dynamically
    profiles_sampler=profiles_sampler
)
```

<Note>

The <PlatformIdentifier name="profiles_sample_rate" /> setting is _relative_ to the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces_sample_rate" /> setting.

</Note>

### Upgrading from older SDK versions

The feature was experimental prior to version `1.17.0`. To update to the latest SDK, remove `profiles_sample_rate` from `_experiments` and set it in the top-level options.

```python
sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___DSN___",
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
    _experiments={
      "profiles_sample_rate": 1.0,  # for versions before 1.17.0
    },
)
```

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["ruby"]}>

<Note>

Ruby profiling beta is available starting in SDK version `5.9.0`.

</Note>

We use the [`stackprof` gem](https://github.com/tmm1/stackprof) to collect profiles for Ruby.

First add `stackprof` to your `Gemfile` and make sure it is loaded before `sentry-ruby`.

```ruby
# Gemfile

gem 'stackprof'
gem 'sentry-ruby'
```

Then, make sure both `traces_sample_rate` and `profiles_sample_rate` are set and non-zero in your sentry initializer.

```ruby
# config/initializers/sentry.rb

Sentry.init do |config|
  config.dsn = "___DSN___"
  config.traces_sample_rate = 1.0
  config.profiles_sample_rate = 1.0
end
```

<Note>

The <PlatformIdentifier name="profiles_sample_rate" /> setting is _relative_ to the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces_sample_rate" /> setting.

</Note>

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["rust"]}>

<Note>

Rust Profiling alpha is available starting in SDK version `0.29.0`.

</Note>

In order to use Profiling, you first need to enable the `profiling` feature in the `sentry` dependency inside the project `Cargo.toml`:

```cargo
[dependencies]
sentry = { version = "{{ packages.version('sentry.rust') }}", features = ["profiling"] }
```

Once you've completed the step above, you can proceed by enabling it in the SDK:

```rust
sentry::init((
    "___DSN___",
    sentry::ClientOptions {
        release: sentry::release_name!(),
        traces_sample_rate: 1.0,
        enable_profiling: true,
        profiles_sample_rate: 1.0,
        ..Default::default()
    },
));
```

<Note>

The <PlatformIdentifier name="profiles_sample_rate" /> setting is _relative_ to the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces_sample_rate" /> setting.

</Note>

</PlatformSection>

## Troubleshooting

If you don't see any profiling data in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io), you can try the following:

- Ensure that performance monitoring <PlatformLink to="/performance/">is enabled</PlatformLink>.
- Ensure that the automatic instrumentation is sending performance data to Sentry by going to the **Performance** page in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).
- If the automatic instrumentation is not sending performance data, try using <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation">custom instrumentation</PlatformLink>.
- Enable <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#debug">debug mode</PlatformLink> in the SDK and check the logs.

### Limitations

Profiles for multi-threaded servers like `puma` might not capture frames correctly when async I/O is happening. This is a limitation of `stackprof`.
