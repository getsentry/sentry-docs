With [profiling](/product/profiling/), Sentry allows you to collect and analyze performance profiles from real user devices in production to give you a complete picture of how your application performs in a variety of environments.

## Enable Performance Monitoring

Profiling depends on Sentryâ€™s performance monitoring product being enabled beforehand. To enable performance monitoring in the SDK:

<PlatformSection supported={["apple"]}>

<SignInNote />

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    options.tracesSampleRate = 1.0
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    options.tracesSampleRate = @1.0;
}];
```

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["android"]}>

In `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<application>
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.dsn" android:value="___PUBLIC_DSN___" />
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.traces.sample-rate" android:value="1.0" />
</application>
```

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["react-native"]}>

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___DSN___",
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["go"]}>

<SignInNote />

```go
err := sentry.Init(sentry.ClientOptions{
	Dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
	EnableTracing: true,
	// We recommend adjusting this value in production:
	TracesSampleRate: 1.0,
})
```

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["python"]}>

<SignInNote />

```python
sentry_sdk.init(
  dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  traces_sample_rate=1.0,
)
```

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["ruby"]}>

<SignInNote />

```ruby
Sentry.init do |config|
  config.dsn = '___PUBLIC_DSN___'
  config.traces_sample_rate = 1.0
end
```

</PlatformSection>

Check out the <PlatformLink to="/performance/">performance setup documentation</PlatformLink> for more detailed information on how to configure sampling. Setting the sample rate to 1.0 means all transactions will be captured.

<PlatformSection supported={["apple", "android"]}>

By default, some transactions will be created automatically for common operations like loading a view controller/activity and app startup.

</PlatformSection>

## Enable Profiling

<PlatformSection supported={["apple"]}>

<Note>

iOS profiling is available starting in SDK version `8.3.1`.

</Note>

<SignInNote />

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    options.tracesSampleRate = 1.0 // tracing must be enabled for profiling
    options.profilesSampleRate = 1.0 // see also `profilesSampler` if you need custom sampling logic
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    options.tracesSampleRate = @1.0; // tracing must be enabled for profiling
    options.profilesSampleRate = @1.0; // see also `profilesSampler` if you need custom sampling logic
}];
```

<Note>

The <PlatformIdentifier name="profiles-sample-rate" /> setting is _relative_ to the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> setting.

</Note>

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["android"]}>

<Note>

Android profiling is available starting in SDK version `6.16.0`.

</Note>

In `AndroidManifest.xml`:

<SignInNote />

```xml
<application>
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.dsn" android:value="___PUBLIC_DSN___" />
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.traces.sample-rate" android:value="1.0" />
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.traces.profiling.sample-rate" android:value="1.0" />
</application>
```

<Note>

The `io.sentry.traces.profiling.sample-rate` setting is _relative_ to the `io.sentry.traces.sample-rate` setting.

</Note>

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["python"]}>

<Note>

Python profiling is available starting in SDK version `1.18.0`.

</Note>

<SignInNote />

```python
import sentry_sdk

def profiles_sampler(sampling_context):
    # ...
    # return a number between 0 and 1 or a boolean

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,

    # To set a uniform sample rate
    # Set profiles_sample_rate to 1.0 to profile 100%
    # of sampled transactions.
    # We recommend adjusting this value in production,
    profiles_sample_rate=1.0,

    # Alternatively, to control sampling dynamically
    profiles_sampler=profiles_sampler
)
```

<Note>

The <PlatformIdentifier name="profiles_sample_rate" /> setting is _relative_ to the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces_sample_rate" /> setting.

</Note>

### Upgrading from older SDK versions

The feature was experimental prior to version `1.17.0`. To update to the latest SDK, remove `profiles_sample_rate` from `_experiments` and set it in the top-level options.

<SignInNote />

```python
sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
    _experiments={
      "profiles_sample_rate": 1.0,  # for versions before 1.17.0
    },
)
```

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["react-native"]}>

<Note>

Profiling for React Native is available in beta in SDK versions `5.8.0` and above. Currently, it supports profiling the JavaScript layer. Combined profiling with native Android/iOS layers isn't supported at this time.

</Note>

To enable profiling, set the `profilesSampleRate`:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___DSN___",
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  _experiments: {
    // profilesSampleRate is relative to tracesSampleRate.
    // Here, we'll capture profiles for 100% of transactions.
    profilesSampleRate: 1.0,
  },
});
```

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["go"]}>

<Note>

Go Profiling alpha is available since SDK version `0.22.0`.

</Note>

To enable profiling, set the `ProfilesSampleRate`:

<SignInNote />

```go
err := sentry.Init(sentry.ClientOptions{
	Dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
	EnableTracing: true,
	// We recommend adjusting these values in production:
	TracesSampleRate: 1.0,
	// The sampling rate for profiling is relative to TracesSampleRate:
	ProfilesSampleRate: 1.0,
})
```

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["ruby"]}>

<Note>

Ruby profiling beta is available starting in SDK version `5.9.0`.

</Note>

We use the [`stackprof` gem](https://github.com/tmm1/stackprof) to collect profiles for Ruby.

First add `stackprof` to your `Gemfile` and make sure it is loaded before `sentry-ruby`.

```ruby
# Gemfile

gem 'stackprof'
gem 'sentry-ruby'
```

Then, make sure both `traces_sample_rate` and `profiles_sample_rate` are set and non-zero in your Sentry initializer.

<SignInNote />

```ruby
# config/initializers/sentry.rb

Sentry.init do |config|
  config.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
  config.traces_sample_rate = 1.0
  config.profiles_sample_rate = 1.0
end
```

<Note>

The <PlatformIdentifier name="profiles_sample_rate" /> setting is _relative_ to the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces_sample_rate" /> setting.
