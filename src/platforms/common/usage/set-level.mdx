The level - similar to logging levels - is generally added by default based on the integration. You can also override it within an event.

<PlatformContent includePath="set-level" />

Available levels are `:fatal`, `:critical`, `:error`, `:warning`, `:log`, `:info`, and `:debug`. The default if not specified is `:error`.
