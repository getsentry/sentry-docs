If your frontend and backend are hosted on different domains (for example, your frontend is on `https://example.com` and your backend is on `https://api.example.com`), and the frontend does XHR/fetch requests to your backend, you'll need to configure your backend [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Headers) headers to ensure requests aren't blocked.

Configure your backend CORS to allow the `sentry-trace` and `baggage` headers.

Your server's response header configuration might look like: `"Access-Control-Allow-Headers: sentry-trace, baggage"`. Your configuration will be specific to your setup.
