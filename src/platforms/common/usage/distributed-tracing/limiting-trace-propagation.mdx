By default, trace information (`sentry-trace` and `baggage` headers) will be added to all outgoing HTTP requests. If you want to limit to the URLs where trace information is added, you can specify a `trace_propagation_targets` option:

<PlatformContent includePath="distributed-tracing/limiting-traces" />

In the example above, trace information will be added to all requests to URLs that contain `"https://myproject.org"` and to all URLs of all sub domains of `otherservice.org` like `https://api.otherservice.org/something/` or `https://payment.otherservice.org/something/`.

See <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#trace-propagation-targets">Tracing Options</PlatformLink> docs for more information about the `trace_propagation_targets` option.
