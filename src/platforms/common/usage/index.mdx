Sentry's SDK hooks into your runtime environment and automatically reports errors, exceptions, and rejections.

The most common form of capturing is to capture errors. What can be captured as an error varies by platform. In general, if you have something that looks like an exception it can be captured. For some SDKs you can also omit the argument to `capture_exception` and Sentry will attempt to capture the current exception. It can also be useful to manually report errors or messages to Sentry.

Separately to capturing you can also record the breadcrumbs that lead up to an event. Breadcrumbs are different from events: they will not create an event in Sentry, but will be buffered until the next event is sent. Learn more about breadcrumbs in our [Breadcrumbs documentation](/platforms/javascript/enriching-error-data/breadcrumbs/).

## Capturing Errors

<PlatformContent includePath="capture-error" />

## Capturing Messages

Another common operation is to capture a bare message. A message is textual information that should be sent to Sentry. Typically messages are not emitted, but they can be useful for some teams.

<PlatformContent includePath="capture-message" />
