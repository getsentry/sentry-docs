<Include name="beta-alert-crons.mdx" />

Sentry Crons allows you to monitor the uptime and performance of any scheduled, recurring job. Once implemented, it'll allow you to get alerts and metrics to help you solve errors, detect timeouts, and prevent disruptions to your service.

<PlatformSection supported={["python", "php"]}>

## Requirements

<PlatformContent includePath="crons/requirements" />

<PlatformContent includePath="crons/setup" />

## Connecting Errors to Cron Monitors

To link any exceptions captured during your job's lifecycle, use <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/context/">Sentry's context</PlatformLink> with your monitor slug.

<PlatformContent includePath="crons/connect-errors" />

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection notSupported={["python", "php"]}>

## Requirements

To begin monitoring your recurring, scheduled job:

1. [Create a new monitor](https://sentry.io/crons/create/) in Sentry.
2. Configure check-ins or a heartbeat for your job.

Optionally, you can skip the first step and [create or update (upsert) a monitor through a check-in](#creating-or-updating-a-monitor-through-a-check-in-optional). See more below.

## Check-Ins (Recommended)

Check-in monitoring allows you to track a job's progress by completing two check-ins: one at the start of your job and another at the end of your job. This two-step process allows Sentry to notify you if your job didn't start when expected (missed) or if it exceeded its maximum runtime (failed).


```bash {tabTitle: curl}
# üü° Notify Sentry your job is running:
curl -X POST \
    'https://sentry.io/api/0/organizations/___ORG_SLUG___/monitors/<monitor_slug>/checkins/' \
    --header 'Authorization: DSN ___PUBLIC_DSN___' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data-raw '{"status": "in_progress"}'

# Execute your scheduled task here...

# üü¢ Notify Sentry your job has completed successfully:
curl -X PUT \
    'https://sentry.io/api/0/organizations/___ORG_SLUG___/monitors/<monitor_slug>/checkins/latest/' \
    --header 'Authorization: DSN ___PUBLIC_DSN___' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data-raw '{"status": "ok"}'
```

<Note>

If you expect your scheduled jobs to overlap, read about [Overlapping Jobs](#overlapping-jobs-optional) below.

</Note>

In case your job execution fails:

```bash {tabTitle: curl}
# üî¥ Notify Sentry your job has failed:
curl -X PUT \
    'https://sentry.io/api/0/organizations/___ORG_SLUG___/monitors/<monitor_slug>/checkins/latest/' \
    --header 'Authorization: DSN ___PUBLIC_DSN___' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data-raw '{"status": "failed"}'
```

### Creating or Updating a Monitor Through a Check-In (Optional)

Sentry enables the automatic creation or update of a monitor (upsert) through the check-in payload. This can be useful if you have many scheduled tasks or need to create them dynamically.

```bash {tabTitle: curl}
# Upsert monitor with a check-in
curl -X POST \
    'https://sentry.io/api/0/organizations/___ORG_SLUG___/monitors/<monitor_slug>/checkins/' \
    --header 'Authorization: DSN ___PUBLIC_DSN___' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data-raw '{"config": {"schedule": "0 * * * *", "schedule_type": "crontab"}, "status": "in_progress"}'
```

### Check-in Attachment (Optional)

Sentry Crons can help you better understand your job check-ins by storing a file, such as a log output. You'll be able to use this to debug check-in failures or track job statuses. To set up your health check, execute an initial HTTP POST (multipart/form-data) check-in request:

```bash {tabTitle: curl}
# Perform a POST request to attach a file to a check-in
curl -X POST \
  'https://sentry.io/api/0/organizations/___ORG_SLUG___/monitors/<monitor_slug>/checkins/latest/attachment/' \
  --header 'Authorization: DSN ___PUBLIC_DSN___' \
  --form 'file=<file_path>'
```

<Note>
We recommend uploading your attachment before you complete your second check-in.
</Note>

Attachments can be downloaded in each corresponding check-in through your ‚ÄúMonitor Details‚Äù page.

Current attachment limitations:
1. Each recurring job is limited to one attachment.
2. The maximum file size is 100kb.
3. Attachments are not currently supported by our CLI or SDKs.

### Overlapping Jobs (Optional)

A job execution that begins before the previous job execution has been completed, is called an overlapping job. This happens if you have a job with a runtime duration longer than your job's interval schedule.

A simple example is if you have a job that runs every minute (1), but takes five (5) minutes to complete each execution.

If this happens, you have to provide a check-in ID with the second check-in request to prevent unintended consequences. The check-in ID will be returned upon your first check-in and can be provided to the second check-in request.

Usage example:

```bash {tabTitle: curl}
curl -X POST \
    'https://sentry.io/api/0/organizations/___ORG_SLUG___/monitors/<monitor_slug>/checkins/' \
    --header 'Authorization: DSN ___PUBLIC_DSN___' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data-raw '{"status": "in_progress"}'
# Response will return { "id": "2bc1a871-a1b7-4577-82fc-fa6d2468aabc" }

# Use the id returned "2bc1a871-a1b7-4577-82fc-fa6d2468aabc" in your request:
curl -X PUT \
    'https://sentry.io/api/0/organizations/___ORG_SLUG___/monitors/<monitor_slug>/checkins/2bc1a871-a1b7-4577-82fc-fa6d2468aabc/' \
    --header 'Authorization: DSN ___PUBLIC_DSN___' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data-raw '{"status": "ok"}'
```

## Heartbeat

Heartbeat monitoring notifies Sentry of a job's status through one check-in. This setup will only notify you if your job didn't start when expected (missed). If you need to track a job to see if it exceeded its maximum runtime (failed), use check-ins instead.

```bash {tabTitle: curl}
# üü¢ Notify Sentry your job has completed successfully:
curl -X POST \
    'https://sentry.io/api/0/organizations/___ORG_SLUG___/monitors/<monitor_slug>/checkins/' \
    --header 'Authorization: DSN ___PUBLIC_DSN___' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data-raw '{"status": "ok"}'
```

In case your job execution fails:

```bash {tabTitle: curl}
# üî¥ Notify Sentry your job has failed:
curl -X PUT \
    'https://sentry.io/api/0/organizations/___ORG_SLUG___/monitors/<monitor_slug>/checkins/latest/' \
    --header 'Authorization: DSN ___PUBLIC_DSN___' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data-raw '{"status": "failed"}'
```

## Connecting Errors to Cron Monitors

If you're capturing Sentry errors, you can link them to a monitor by using context.

```php
\Sentry\configureScope(function (\Sentry\State\Scope $scope): void {
    $scope->setContext('monitor', [
        'slug' => 'monitor-slug-here',
    ]);
});
```

</PlatformSection>

## Alerts

When your recurring job fails to check in (missed), runs beyond its configured maximum runtime (failed), or manually reports a failure, Sentry will create an error event with a tag to your monitor.

To receive alerts on these events:
1. Navigate to **Alerts** in the sidebar.
2. Create a new alert and select "Issues" under "Errors" as the alert type.
3. Configure your alert and define a filter match to use: `The event's tags match {key} {match} {value}`.

Example: `The event's tags match monitor.slug equals my-monitor-slug-here`
