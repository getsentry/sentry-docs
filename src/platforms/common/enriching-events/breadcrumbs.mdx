Sentry uses _breadcrumbs_ to create a trail of events that happened prior to an issue. These events are very similar to traditional logs, but can record more rich structured data.

This page provides an overview of manual breadcrumb recording and customization. Learn more about the information that displays on the **Issue Details** page and how you can filter breadcrumbs to quickly resolve issues in [Using Breadcrumbs](/product/error-monitoring/breadcrumbs).

<Alert level="" title="Learn about SDK usage">

Developers who want to modify the breadcrumbs interface can read about this in detail using the developer documentation devoted to the [Breadcrumbs Interface](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/event-payloads/breadcrumbs/).

## Manual Breadcrumbs

You can manually add breadcrumbs whenever something interesting happens. For example, you might manually record a breadcrumb if the user authenticates or another state change happens.

<PlatformContent includePath="breadcrumbs-example" />

<PlatformSection supported={["javascript", "node", "python", "php", "ruby", "elixir", "perl", "native"]}>

The available breadcrumb keys are `type`, `category`, `message`, `level`, `timestamp` (which many SDKs will set automatically for you), and `data`, which is the place to put any additional information you'd like the breadcrumb to include. Using keys other than these six won't cause an error, but will result in the data being dropped when the event is processed by Sentry.

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection notSupported={["native"]}>

## Automatic Breadcrumbs

SDKs and their associated integrations will automatically record many types of breadcrumbs. For instance, the browser JavaScript SDK will automatically record all location changes.

## Customize Breadcrumbs

SDKs allow you to customize breadcrumbs through the `before_breadcrumb` hook. This hook is passed an already assembled breadcrumb and, in some SDKs, an optional hint. The function can modify the breadcrumb or decide to discard it entirely by returning `null`:

<PlatformContent includePath="before-breadcrumb" />

For information about what can be done with the hint, see <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/">Filtering Events</PlatformLink>.
