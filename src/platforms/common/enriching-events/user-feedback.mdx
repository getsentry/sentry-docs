When a user experiences an error, Sentry provides the ability to collect additional feedback. This type of feedback is useful when you may typically render a plain error page (the classic `500.html`).

To collect feedback, use the embeddable JavaScript widget, which requests and collects the user's name, email address, and a description of what occurred. When feedback is provided, Sentry pairs the feedback with the original event, giving you additional insights into issues.

The screenshot below provides an example of the User Feedback widget, though yours may differ depending on your customization:

## Collecting Feedback

To integrate the widget, you'll need to be running version 2.1 or newer of our JavaScript SDK. The widget authenticates with your public DSN, then passes in the client-side generated Event ID. If you'd prefer an alternative to the widget, you can use the User Feedback API.

If you're using a framework, such as React or Angular, we recommend collecting user feedback in your error-handling component. Examples are provided in the [React](/platforms/javascript/react/components/errorboundary/) and [Angular](/platforms/javascript/angular/) documentation. If you're not using a framework, you can collect feedback just before an event is sent using `beforeSend`:

<PlatformContent includePath="user-feedback-example" />

## Customizing the Widget

You can customize the widget to your organization's needs, especially for localization purposes. All options can be passed through the `showReportDialog` call.
