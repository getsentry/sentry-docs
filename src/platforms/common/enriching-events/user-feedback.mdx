When a user experiences an error, Sentry provides the ability to collect additional feedback. You can collect feedback according to the method supported by the SDK.

<PlatformSection supported={["java", "apple", "android"]} >

## User Feedback API

The user feedback API provides the ability to collect user information when an event occurs. You can use the same programming language you have in your app to send user feedback. In this case, the SDK creates the HTTP request so you don't have to deal with posting data via HTTP.

Sentry pairs the feedback with the original event, giving you additional insight into issues. Sentry needs the `eventId` to be able to associate the user feedback to the corresponding event. To get the `eventId`, for example, you can use the <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#before-send">beforeSend</PlatformLink> or the return value of the methods capturing an event.

## Use the .NET SDK

<Note>

User Feedback for **[ASP.NET](/platforms/dotnet/guides/aspnet/enriching-events/user-feedback/#integration)** or **[ASP.NET Core](/platforms/dotnet/guides/aspnetcore/enriching-events/user-feedback/#integration)** supply integrations specific to supporting those SDKs.

</Note>

You can create a form to collect the user input in your prefered framework, and use the SDK's API to send the information to Sentry. You can also use the widget, as described below. If you'd prefer an alternative to the widget or do not have a JavaScript frontend, you can use this API or a [Web API](/api/projects/submit-user-feedback/).

```csharp {tabTitle:C#}
using Sentry;

var eventId = SentrySdk.CaptureMessage("An event that will receive user feedback.");

SentrySdk.CaptureUserFeedback(eventId, "user@example.com", "It broke.", "The User");
```

```fsharp {tabTitle:F#}
open Sentry

let eventId = SentrySdk.CaptureMessage("An event that will receive user feedback.")

SentrySdk.CaptureUserFeedback(eventId, "user@example.com", "It broke.", "The User")
```

## Embeddable JavaScript Widget

Our embeddable JavaScript widget is useful when you may typically render a plain error page (the classic `500.html`) on your website.

To collect feedback, the widget requests and collects the user's name, email address, and a description of what occurred. When feedback is provided, Sentry pairs the feedback with the original event, giving you additional insights into issues.

The screenshot below provides an example of the User Feedback widget, though yours may differ depending on your customization:

### Integration

To integrate the widget, you'll need to be running version 2.1 or newer of our JavaScript SDK. The widget authenticates with your public DSN, then passes in the Event ID that was generated on your backend.

## Customizing the Widget

You can customize the widget to your organization's needs, especially for localization purposes. All options can be passed through the `showReportDialog` call.
