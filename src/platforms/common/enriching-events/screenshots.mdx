When a user experiences an error, Sentry provides the ability to take a screenshot and include it as an <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/attachments/">attachment</PlatformLink>.

This feature only applies to SDKs with a user interface, such as the ones for mobile and desktop applications. In some environments like native iOS, taking a screenshot requires the UI thread and in the event of a crash, that might not be available. So inherently, this feature will be a best effort solution.

## Enabling Screenshots

Screenshots may contain <PlatformLink to="/data-management/sensitive-data/">PII</PlatformLink> and is an opt-in feature. You can enable it as shown below:

<PlatformContent includePath="enriching-events/attach-screenshots" />

## Viewing Screenshots

Screenshots appear on the **Issue Details** page, where you can view the thumbnail, as well as associated events. Click the event ID to open the **Issue Details** of that specific event.

Alternatively, screenshots are also available in the "Attachments" tab on the **Issue Details** page, where you can view all attachments, as well as associated events. Click the event ID to open the **Issue Details** of that specific event.

<Note>
This feature is available only if you're in the Early Adopter program. Features available to Early Adopters are still in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.
If you’re interested in being an Early Adopter, you can turn your organization’s Early Adopter status on/off in General Settings. This will affect all users in your organization and can be turned back off just as easily.
