**Tags** are key/value string pairs that are both indexed and searchable. Tags power UI features such as filters and tag-distribution maps. Tags also help you quickly access related events and view the tag distribution for a set of events. Common uses for tags include hostname, platform version, and user language.

Weâ€™ll automatically index all tags for an event, as well as the frequency and the last time that Sentry has seen a tag. We also keep track of the number of distinct tags and can assist you in determining hotspots for various issues.

<PlatformSection notSupported={["native.minidumps"]}>

Defining tags is easy, and will bind them to the [current scope](../scopes/) ensuring all future events within scope contain the same tags:

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformContent includePath="set-tag" />

<Note>

Some tags are automatically set by Sentry. We strongly recommend against overwriting those tags, and instead using your own nomenclature for names.

</Note>

Once you've started sending tagged data, you'll see it in the Sentry web UI: the filters within the sidebar on the Project page, summarized within an event, and on the tags page for an aggregated event.
