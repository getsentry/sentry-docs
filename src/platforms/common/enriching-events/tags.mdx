**Tags** are key/value string pairs that are both indexed and searchable. Tags power features in sentry.io such as filters and tag-distribution maps. Tags also help you quickly both access related events and view the tag distribution for a set of events. Common uses for tags include hostname, platform version, and user language.

Weâ€™ll automatically index all tags for an event, as well as the frequency and the last time that Sentry has seen a tag. We also keep track of the number of distinct tags and can assist you in determining hotspots for various issues.

_Tag keys_ have a maximum length of 32 characters, while _tag values_ have a maximum length of 200 characters.

<PlatformSection notSupported={["native.minidumps", "native.wasm", "php", "php.laravel", "php.symfony", "flutter"]}>

Defining tags is easy, and will bind them to the [current scope](../scopes/) ensuring all future events within scope contain the same tags.

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["javascript", "node"]}>

You'll first need to import the SDK, as usual:

<PlatformContent includePath="enriching-events/import" />

</PlatformSection>

Define the tag:

<PlatformContent includePath="enriching-events/set-tag" />

<Note>

Some tags are automatically set by Sentry. We strongly recommend against overwriting those tags. Instead, name your tags with your organization's nomenclature.

</Note>

Once you've started sending tagged data, you'll see it when logged in to sentry.io. There, you can view the filters within the sidebar on the Project page, summarized within an event, and on the Tags page for an aggregated event.
