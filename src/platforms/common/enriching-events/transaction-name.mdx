The current transaction name is used to group transactions in our
[Performance](/product/performance/) product, as well as annotate error events
with their point of failure.

The transaction name can reference the current web app route, or the current
task being executed. For example:

- `GET /api/{version}/users/`
- `UserListView`
- `myapp.tasks.renew_all_subscriptions`

Ideally, the transaction name does not contain variable values such as user
IDs but has rather low cardinality while still uniquely identifying a piece of
code you care about.

A lot of our framework integrations already set a transaction name. To set one yourself:

<PlatformContent includePath="set-transaction-name" />

This will override the name of the currently running transaction.

<PlatformSection supported={["javascript", "node", "python"]}>

Please refer to [the tracing documentation](../../performance/) for how to start and stop transactions.

</PlatformSection>
