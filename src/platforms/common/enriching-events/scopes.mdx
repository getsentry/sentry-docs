When an event is captured and sent to Sentry, SDKs will merge that event data with extra
information from the current scope. SDKs will typically automatically manage the scopes
for you in the framework integrations and you don't need to think about them. However,
you should know what a scope is and how you can use it for your advantage.

## What's a Scope, What's a Hub

You can think of the hub as the central point that our SDKs use to route an
event to Sentry. When you call `init()` a hub is created and a client and a
blank scope are created on it. That hub is then associated with the current
thread and will internally hold a stack of scopes.

The scope will hold useful information that should be sent along with the
event. For instance [contexts](../context/) or
[breadcrumbs](../breadcrumbs/) are stored on
the scope. When a scope is pushed, it inherits all data from the parent scope
and when it pops all modifications are reverted.

The default SDK integrations will push and pop scopes intelligently. For
instance web framework integrations will create and destroy scopes around your
routes or controllers.

## How the Scope and Hub Work

As you start using an SDK, a scope and hub are automatically created for you out
of the box. It's unlikely that you'll interact with the hub directly unless you're
writing an integration or you want to create or destroy scopes. Scopes, on the
other hand are more user facing. You can call <PlatformIdentifier name="configure-scope" /> at any point in
time to modify data stored on the scope. This is useful for doing things like
[modifying the context](../context/).

<PlatformSection supported={["python", "dotnet"]}>
<Alert>
If you are very curious about how thread locality works: On platforms such as .NET
or on Python 3.7 and later we will use "ambient data" to have either the hub flow
with your code or the hub is already a singleton that internally manages the scope.

Effectively this means that when you spawn a task in .NET and the execution flow is
not suppressed all the context you have bound to the scope in Sentry will flow along.
If however you suppress the flow, you get new scope data.

</Alert>
</PlatformSection>

When you call a global function such as <PlatformIdentifier name="capture-event" /> internally Sentry
discovers the current hub and asks it to capture an event. Internally the hub will
then merge the event with the topmost scope's data.

<PlatformSection supported={["native"]}>

<Alert level="warning" title="Hub Abstraction Is Not Implemented">

The Native SDK currently only provides a single scope shared by all threads in the program and maintains no thread-local state by way of a hub. Because of this limitation, you must make sure that your threads don't logically interfere with each other's changes to the global scope, even though they are safe to do so purely from a data-race perspective. This affects use cases where, for example, you want to track many users in server-like programs while capturing events or when you want to trace multiple threads in performance monitoring.

For details on how this affects performance monitoring, check out the [Connect Errors With Spans](/platforms/native/performance/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation/#connect-errors-with-spans) section of "Custom Instrumentation".

## Configuring the Scope

The most useful operation when working with scopes is the <PlatformIdentifier name="configure-scope" /> function. It can be used to reconfigure the current scope.

<PlatformSection supported={["javascript", "node"]}>

You'll first need to import the SDK, as usual:

<PlatformContent includePath="enriching-events/import" />

</PlatformSection>

You can, for instance, add custom tags or inform Sentry about the currently authenticated user.

<PlatformContent includePath="enriching-events/scopes/configure-scope" />

<PlatformContent includePath="enriching-events/unset-user">

You can also apply this configuration when unsetting a user at logout:

</PlatformContent>

<PlatformSection supported={["android", "flutter"]}>

<PlatformContent includePath="enriching-events/scopes/scope-synchronization" />

</PlatformSection>

To learn what useful information can be associated with scopes see
[the context documentation](../context/).

<PlatformSection notSupported={["native"]}>

## Local Scopes

We also support pushing and configuring a scope within a single call. This is typically
called <PlatformIdentifier name="with-scope" />, <PlatformIdentifier name="push-scope" /> or implemented as a function parameter on the capture methods, depending on the SDK. It's very helpful if
you only want to send data for one specific event.

<PlatformSection supported={["go", "java", "javascript", "php", "python", "ruby", "rust"]} notSupported={["android", "kotlin-multiplatform"]}>

### Using <PlatformIdentifier name="with-scope" />

In the following example we use <PlatformIdentifier name="with-scope" /> to attach a `level` and a `tag` to only one specific error:

<PlatformContent includePath="enriching-events/scopes/with-scope" />

While this example looks similar to <PlatformIdentifier name="configure-scope" />, it is actually very different.
Calls to <PlatformIdentifier name="configure-scope" /> change the current active scope; all successive calls to <PlatformIdentifier name="configure-scope" /> will maintain previously set changes unless they are explicitly unset.

On the other hand, <PlatformIdentifier name="with-scope" /> creates a clone of the current scope, and the changes
made will stay isolated within the <PlatformIdentifier name="with-scope" /> callback function. This allows you to
more easily isolate pieces of context information to specific locations in your code or
even call <PlatformIdentifier name="clear" /> to briefly remove all context information.

<PlatformSection notSupported={["ruby"]}>
<Alert level="info" title="Important">

Errors that occur within the callback of <PlatformIdentifier name="with-scope" /> are **not** caught and reported to Sentry.

</Alert>
</PlatformSection>

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["apple", "dart", "dotnet", "java", "unreal", "kotlin-multiplatform"]}>

### Using Scope Callback Parameter

In the following example we use the scope callback parameter that is available for all `capture` methods to attach a `level` and a `tag` to only one specific error:

<PlatformContent includePath="enriching-events/scopes/scope-callback-param" />

Before the callback is invoked the SDK creates a clone of the current scope, and the changes
made will stay isolated within the callback function. This allows you to
more easily isolate pieces of context information to specific locations in your code or
even call `clear` to briefly remove all context information.

<Alert level="info" title="Important">

Any exceptions that occur within the callback function for configuring a local scope will not be
caught, and all errors that occur will be silently ignored and **not** reported.

## Kotlin Coroutines

Sentry's SDK for Java stores the scope and the context in a thread-local variable. To make sure that a coroutine has access to the correct Sentry context, an instance of `SentryContext` must be provided when launching a coroutine.

### Installation

```xml {tabTitle:Maven}
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.sentry</groupId>
    <artifactId>sentry-kotlin-extensions</artifactId>
    <version>{{@inject packages.version('sentry.java.kotlin-extensions', '5.0.0') }}</version>
</dependency>
```

```groovy {tabTitle:Gradle}
implementation 'io.sentry:sentry-kotlin-extensions:{{@inject packages.version('sentry.java.kotlin-extensions', '5.0.0') }}'
```

```scala {tabTitle: SBT}
libraryDependencies += "io.sentry" % "sentry-kotlin-extensions" % "{{@inject packages.version('sentry.java.kotlin-extensions', '5.0.0') }}"
```

### Usage

```kotlin
import io.sentry.kotlin.SentryContext
import io.sentry.Sentry

launch(SentryContext()) {
  // tag set in parent coroutine is visible to child coroutine
  Sentry.setTag("parent-tag", "value")
  launch() {
    // tag set in child coroutine is not visible in parent coroutine
    Sentry.setTag("child-tag", "value")
  }
}
```
