When an event is captured and sent to Sentry, SDKs will merge that event data with extra
information from the current scope. SDKs will typically automatically manage the scopes
for you in the framework integrations and you don't need to think about them. However,
you should know what a scope is and how you can use it for your advantage.

## What's a Scope, What's a Hub

You can think of the hub as the central point that our SDKs use to route an
event to Sentry. When you call `init()` a hub is created and a client and a
blank scope are created on it. That hub is then associated with the current
thread and will internally hold a stack of scopes.

The scope will hold useful information that should be sent along with the
event. For instance [contexts](../context/) or
[breadcrumbs](../breadcrumbs/) are stored on
the scope. When a scope is pushed, it inherits all data from the parent scope
and when it pops all modifications are reverted.

The default SDK integrations will push and pop scopes intelligently. For
instance web framework integrations will create and destroy scopes around your
routes or controllers.

## How the Scope and Hub Work

As you start using an SDK a scope and hub are automatically created for you out
of the box. The hub you are unlikely to be interacting with directly unless you
are writing an integration or you want to create or destroy scopes. Scopes on the
other hand are more user facing. You can at any point in time call
`configure-scope` to modify data stored on the scope. This is for instance
used to [modify the context](../context/).

<Alert>
If you are very curious about how thread locality works: On platforms such as .NET
or on Python 3.7 and later we will use "ambient data" to have either the hub flow
with your code or the hub is already a singleton that internally manages the scope.

Effectively this means that when you spawn a task in .NET and the execution flow is
not suppressed all the context you have bound to the scope in Sentry will flow along.
If however you suppress the flow, you get new scope data.
</Alert>

When you call a global function such as `capture_event` internally Sentry
discovers the current hub and asks it to capture an event. Internally the hub will
then merge the event with the topmost scope's data.

## Configuring the Scope

The most useful operation when working with scopes is the `configure-scope` function. It can be used to reconfigure the current scope.

<PlatformSection supported={["javascript", "node"]}>

You'll first need to import the SDK, as usual:

<PlatformContent includePath="enriching-events/import" />

</PlatformSection>

You can, for instance, add custom tags or inform Sentry about the currently authenticated user.

<PlatformContent includePath="enriching-events/scopes/configure-scope" />

You can also apply this configuration when unsetting a user at logout:

<PlatformContent includePath="enriching-events/unset-user" />

To learn what useful information can be associated with scopes see
[the context documentation](../context/).

## Local Scopes

We also have support for pushing and configuring a scope in one go. This is typically called `with-scope` or `push-scope` which is also very helpful if you only want to send data with one specific event. In the following example we are using that function to attach a `level` and a `tag` to only one specific error:

<PlatformContent includePath="enriching-events/scopes/with-scope" />

While this example looks similar to `configure-scope`, it's very different, in the sense that `configure-scope` actually changes the current active scope, all successive calls to `configure-scope`
will keep the changes.

While on the other hand using `with-scope` creates a clone of the current scope
and will stay isolated until the function call is completed. So you can either
set context information in there that you don't want to be somewhere else or not
attach any context information at all by calling `clear` on the scope, while the
"global" scope remains unchanged.

Keep in mind that `with-scope` will not capture any exceptions that happen inside its callback function,
and every error that happens there will be silently ignored and *not* reported.

## Kotlin Coroutines

<Note>

Support for Kotlin Coroutines is available as a Beta. Features available in Beta are still in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.

</Note>

Sentry's SDK for Java stores the scope and the context in a thread-local variable. To make sure that a coroutine has access to the correct Sentry context, an instance of `SentryContext` must be provided when launching a coroutine.

### Installation

```xml {tabTitle:Maven}
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.sentry</groupId>
    <artifactId>sentry-kotlin-extensions</artifactId>
    <version>{{ packages.version('sentry.java.kotlin-extensions', '5.0.0') }}</version>
</dependency>
```

```groovy {tabTitle:Gradle}
implementation 'io.sentry:sentry-kotlin-extensions:{{ packages.version('sentry.java.kotlin-extensions', '5.0.0') }}'
```

```scala {tabTitle: SBT}
libraryDependencies += "io.sentry" % "sentry-kotlin-extensions" % "{{ packages.version('sentry.java.kotlin-extensions', '5.0.0') }}"
```

### Usage

```kotlin
import io.sentry.kotlin.SentryContext
import io.sentry.Sentry

launch(SentryContext()) {
  // tag set in parent coroutine is visible to child coroutine
  Sentry.setTag("parent-tag", "value")
  launch() {
    // tag set in child coroutine is not visible in parent coroutine
    Sentry.setTag("child-tag", "value")
  }
}
```
