You can enrich events with additional data by adding your own event processors, either on the scope level or globally. Though event processors are similar to <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send" /> and <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send-transaction" />, there are two key differences:

- <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send" /> and <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send-transaction" /> are
  guaranteed to be run last, after all other event processors, (which means they get the final
  version of the event right before it's sent, hence the name). Event processors added with
  either of the methods below run in an undetermined order, which means changes to the event
  may still be made after the event processor runs.
- While <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send" />, <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send-transaction" />, and processors added with <PlatformIdentifier name="Sentry.add-global-event-processor" /> run globally, regardless of scope, processors added with <PlatformIdentifier name="scope.add-event-processor" /> only run on events captured while that scope is active.

Like <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send" /> and <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send-transaction" />, event processors are passed two arguments, the event itself and <PlatformLink to="/configuration/filtering/#using-hints">a `hint` object</PlatformLink> containing extra metadata.
