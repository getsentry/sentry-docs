description: 'Learn how to configure the SDK to capture the user and gain critical pieces of information that construct a unique identity in Sentry.'
---

Users consist of a few critical pieces of information that construct a unique identity in Sentry. Each of these is optional, but one **must** be present for the Sentry SDK to capture the user:

<DefinitionList>

<PlatformSection notSupported={["apple"]}>

### `id`

<PlatformSection notSupported={["java"]} supported={["android"]}>

<Note>

If you don't provide an `id`, the SDK falls back to `installationId`, which the SDK randomly generates once during an app's installation.

</Note>

</PlatformSection>

Your internal identifier for the user.

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["apple"]}>

### `userId`

<Note>

Since version 6.0.1, if you don't provide a `userId`, the SDK falls back to `installationId`, which the SDK randomly generates once during an app's installation.

</Note>

Your internal identifier for the user.

</PlatformSection>

### `username`

The username. Typically used as a better label than the internal id.

<PlatformSection supported={["go", "dart"]}>

### `name`

The user's first and/or last name.

</PlatformSection>

### `email`

An alternative, or addition, to the username. Sentry is aware of email addresses and can display things such as Gravatars and unlock messaging capabilities.

<PlatformSection supported={["apple", "dotnet", "java", "javascript", "dart", "react-native", "php", "go"]}>

### `segment`

The user segment, for apps that divide users in user segments.

</PlatformSection>

### `ip_address`

The user's IP address. If the user is unauthenticated, Sentry uses the IP address as a unique identifier for the user.
Serverside SDKs that instrument incoming requests will attempt to pull the IP address from the HTTP request data (`request.env.REMOTE_ADDR` field in JSON), if available. <PlatformSection notSupported={["javascript", "node"]}>That might require <PlatformIdentifier name="send-default-pii" /> set to `true` in the SDK options.</PlatformSection><PlatformSection supported={["javascript", "node"]}>This requires you to set the `include.ip` option to `true` in the [`RequestData`](/platforms/node/guides/connect/configuration/integrations/default-integrations/#requestdata) integration.</PlatformSection>

If the user's `ip_address` is set to `"{{auto}}"`, Sentry will infer the IP address from the connection between your app and Sentry's server. <PlatformSection supported={["apple"]}>Due to backward compatibility concerns, Sentry sets the IP address to `"{{auto}}"` out of the box for Apple. Therefore setting <PlatformIdentifier name="send-default-pii" /> to `false` won't stop Sentry from collecting users' IP addresses via the client connection. Read the paragraphs below to find out how to opt out of collecting users' IP addresses.</PlatformSection>

If the field is omitted, the default value is `null`. However, due to backwards compatibility concerns, certain platforms (in particular JavaScript) have a different default value for `"{{auto}}"`. SDKs and other clients should not rely on this behavior and should set IP addresses or `"{{auto}}"` explicitly.

To opt out of storing users' IP addresses in your event data, you can go to your project settings, click on "Security & Privacy", and enable "Prevent Storing of IP Addresses" or use Sentry's [server-side data](/product/data-management-settings/scrubbing/) scrubbing to remove `$user.ip_address`. Adding such a rule ultimately overrules any other logic.

</DefinitionList>

Additionally, you can provide arbitrary key/value pairs beyond the reserved names, and the Sentry SDK will store those with the user.

<PlatformSection supported={["react-native"]}>

By default, we don't apply the user identification provided to the SDK via the API. Instead, we use the installation ID generated with the first use of the application. The ID doesn't contain any private or public data of your users or any public or shared data of their device.

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["javascript", "node"]}>

You'll first need to import the SDK, as usual:

<PlatformContent includePath="enriching-events/import" />

</PlatformSection>

To identify the user:

<PlatformContent includePath="enriching-events/set-user" />

<PlatformContent includePath="enriching-events/unset-user">

You can also clear the currently set user:
