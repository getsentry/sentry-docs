description: "Learn how to configure the SDK to capture the user and gain critical pieces of information that construct a unique identity in Sentry."
---

Users consist of a few critical pieces of information that construct a unique identity in Sentry. Each of these is optional, but one **must** be present for the Sentry SDK to capture the user:

`id`

: Your internal identifier for the user.

`username`

: The username. Typically used as a better label than the internal id.

`email`

: An alternative, or addition, to the username. Sentry is aware of email addresses and can display things such as Gravatars and unlock messaging capabilities.

`ip_address`

: The user's IP address. If the user is unauthenticated, Sentry uses the IP address as a unique identifier for the user. Sentry will attempt to pull this from the HTTP request data, if available. Set to `"{{auto}}"` to let Sentry infer the IP address from the connection.

Additionally, you can provide arbitrary key/value pairs beyond the reserved names, and the Sentry SDK will store those with the user.
