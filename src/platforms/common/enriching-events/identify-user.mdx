---

Users consist of a few critical pieces of information that construct a unique identity in Sentry. Each of these is optional, but one **must** be present for the Sentry SDK to capture the user:

`id`

: Your internal identifier for the user.

`username`

: The username. Typically used as a better label than the internal id.

`email`

: An alternative (or addition) to the username. Sentry is aware of email addresses and can display things such as Gravatars and unlock messaging capabilities.

`ip_address`

: The user's IP address. If the user is unauthenticated, Sentry uses the IP address as a unique identifier for the user. Sentry will attempt to pull this from the HTTP request data, if available.

To identify the user:

<PlatformContent includePath="set-user" />

Additional key/value pairs can be specified as metadata and the Sentry SDK will store those with the user.

<PlatformContent includePath="unset-user">

You can also clear the currently set user:

</PlatformContent>
