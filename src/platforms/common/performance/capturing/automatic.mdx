<Note>

To _automatically_ capture transactions, you must first <PlatformLink to="/performance/">enable tracing in your app.</PlatformLink>

</Note>

The `@sentry/tracing` package provides a `BrowserTracing` integration to add _automatic_ instrumentation for monitoring the performance of browser applications.

## What Automatic Instrumentation Provides

The `BrowserTracing` integration creates a new transaction for each page load and navigation event, and creates a child span for every `XMLHttpRequest` or `fetch` request that occurs while those transactions are open. Learn more about [traces, transactions, and spans](/product/performance/distributed-tracing/).

## Enable Automatic Instrumentation

To enable this automatic tracing, include the `BrowserTracing` integration in your SDK configuration options. (Note that when using ESM modules, the main `@sentry/*` import must come before the `@sentry/tracing` import.)

## Configuration Options

You can pass many different options to the `BrowserTracing` integration (as an object of the form `{optionName: value}`), but it comes with reasonable defaults out of the box. For all possible options, see [TypeDocs](https://getsentry.github.io/sentry-javascript/interfaces/tracing.browsertracingoptions.html).

### tracingOrigins

The default value of `tracingOrigins` is `['localhost', /^\//]`. The JavaScript SDK will attach the `sentry-trace` header to all outgoing XHR/fetch requests whose destination contains a string in the list or matches a regex in the list. If your frontend is making requests to a different domain, you will need to add it there to propagate the `sentry-trace` header to the backend services, which is required to link transactions together as part of a single trace. **The `tracingOrigins` option matches against the whole request URL, not just the domain. Using stricter regex to match certain parts of the URL ensures that requests do not unnecessarily have the `sentry-trace` header attached.**

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/tracingOrigins-example" />

You will need to configure your web server CORS to allow the `sentry-trace` header. The configuration might look like `"Access-Control-Allow-Headers: sentry-trace"`, but the configuration depends on your set up. If you do not allow the `sentry-trace` header, the request might be blocked.

### beforeNavigate

For `pageload` and `navigation` transactions, the `BrowserTracing` integration uses the browser's `window.location` API to generate a transaction name. To customize the name of the `pageload` and `navigation` transactions, you can supply a `beforeNavigate` option to the `BrowserTracing` integration. This option allows you to modify the transaction name to make it more generic, so that, for example, transactions named `GET /users/12312012` and `GET /users/11212012` can both be renamed `GET /users/:userid`, so that they'll group together.

### shouldCreateSpanForRequest

This function can be used to filter out unwanted spans such as XHR's running health checks or something similar. By default `shouldCreateSpanForRequest` already filters out everything but what was defined in `tracingOrigins`.
