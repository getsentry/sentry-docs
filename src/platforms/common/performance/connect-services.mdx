When tracing is enabled, the SDK will attach an outgoing header called `sentry-trace` to requests. This depends on the out of the box integrations we provide, but you can expect the header `sentry-trace` to be present. If it's not, you can manually add `sentry-trace` headers to any requests by learning more about [its structure](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/performance/#header-sentry-trace).

SDKs with performance monitoring support listen to incoming requests and typically automatically pick up the incoming `sentry-trace` header to continue the trace (with the same `trace-id`) from there, connecting backend and frontend transactions into a single coherent trace using the `trace_id` value. Depending on the circumstance, this ID is transmitted either in a request header or in an HTML `<meta>` tag. All your transactions that have the same `trace-id` are connected. Linking transactions in this way makes it possible to navigate among them in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) to better understand how the different parts of your system are affecting one another. You can learn more about this model in our [Distributed Tracing](/product/sentry-basics/tracing/distributed-tracing/) docs.

If the instrumentation you are using doesn't automatically pick up the `sentry-trace` header, you can also continue a trace manually by using the `continueFromHeaders` function on a `Transaction`, which you can learn more about in our content for [the Transaction Interface](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/performance/#new-span-and-transaction-classes).

### Navigation and Other XHR Requests

For traces that begin in the front end, any requests made (and any requests your backend makes as a result) are linked through the request header `sentry-trace`.

All of Sentry's tracing-related integrations (`BrowserTracing`, `Http`, and `Express`), as well as the Next.JS SDK, either generate or pick up and propagate the trace header automatically as appropriate, for all transactions and spans that they generate.

The JavaScript SDK will only attach the trace header to outgoing HTTP requests whose destination is a substring or regex match to the <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#tracingorigins">tracingOrigins</PlatformLink> list.

<!-- copied from automatic-instrumentation to emphasize this point -->

You will need to configure your web server [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Headers) to allow the `sentry-trace` header. The configuration might look like `"Access-Control-Allow-Headers: sentry-trace"`, but the configuration depends on your set up. If you do not allow the `sentry-trace` header, the request might be blocked.

### Pageload

For traces that begin in your backend, you can connect the automatically-generated `pageload` transaction on the frontend with the request transaction that serves the page on the backend. Because JavaScript code running in a browser cannot read the response headers of the current page, the `trace_id` must be transmitted in the response itself, specifically in a `<meta>` tag in the `<head>` of the HTML sent from your backend.

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <meta name="sentry-trace" content="{{ span.toSentryTrace() }}" />
    <!-- ... -->
  </head>
</html>
```

The `name` attribute must be the string `"sentry-trace"` and the `content` attribute must be generated by your backend's Sentry SDK using `span.toSentryTrace()` (or equivalent, depending on the backend platform). This guarantees that a new and unique value will be generated for each request.

<Note>

The `span.toSentryTrace()` was previously called `span.toTraceparent()`, so that's what you may find depending on the SDK and version.

</Note>

The `span` reference is either the transaction that serves the HTML, or any of its child spans. It defines the parent of the `pageload` transaction.

Once the data is included in the `<meta>` tag, our `BrowserTracing` integration will pick it up automatically and link it to the transaction generated on pageload. (Note that it will not get linked to automatically-generated `navigation` transactions, that is, those which don't require a full page reload. Each of those will be the result of a different request transaction on the backend, and therefore should have a unique `trace_id`.)
