When tracing is enabled, the SDK will attach an outgoing header called `sentry-trace` to requests. This depends on the out of the box integrations we provide, but you can expect the header `sentry-trace` to be present. If it's not, you can manually add `sentry-trace` headers to any requests by learning more about [its structure](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/performance/#header-sentry-trace).

SDKs with performance monitoring support listen to incoming requests and typically automatically pick up the incoming `sentry-trace` header to continue the trace (with the same `trace-id`) from there, connecting backend and frontend transactions into a single coherent trace using the `trace_id` value. Depending on the circumstance, this ID is transmitted either in a request header or in an HTML `<meta>` tag. 

All your transactions that have the same `trace-id` are connected. Linking transactions in this way makes it possible to navigate among them in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) to better understand how the different parts of your system are affecting one another. You can learn more about this model in our [Distributed Tracing](/product/sentry-basics/tracing/distributed-tracing/) docs.

If the instrumentation you're using doesn't automatically pick up the `sentry-trace` header, you can also continue a trace manually by using the `continueFromHeaders` function on a `Transaction`. Learn more about this in our [Transaction Interface](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/performance/#new-span-and-transaction-classes) documentation.
