## Distributed Tracing

Traces can bridge across multiple software services. Each span in a trace can be represented as a `sentry-trace` header, containing the trace id, span id, and sampling details. This `sentry-trace` header can be passed to downstream services so that they can create spans that are a continuation of the trace started in the originating service.
