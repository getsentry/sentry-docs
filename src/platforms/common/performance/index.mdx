<Alert level="info" title="Do you need to set up?">

Getting Started includes code samples to both enable and configure Performance Monitoring; proceed straight to our content about instrumentation.

If you're adding tracing, enable and configure it as documented here. If you’re on a legacy plan, you'll also need to add transaction events to your [plan](https://sentry.io/pricing/).

</Alert>

With [performance monitoring](/product/performance/), Sentry tracks your software performance, measuring metrics like throughput and latency, and displaying the impact of errors across multiple systems. Sentry captures distributed traces consisting of transactions and spans, which measure individual services and individual operations within those services. Learn more about our model in [Distributed Tracing](/product/performance/distributed-tracing/).

<PlatformSection supported={["apple"]}>

Automatic instrumentation for monitoring the performance of your application isn't yet supported. Instead, you can <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation/">use custom instrumentation to capture transactions</PlatformLink>.

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["javascript", "javascript.vue", "java.spring", "react-native"]} notSupported={["java", "go", "android", "ruby", "python", "dotnet"]}>

## Enable Tracing

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/enable-tracing" />

</PlatformSection>

## Configure the Sample Rate

Once you configure the <PlatformLink to="/configuration/sampling/">sample rate</PlatformLink>, tracing will be enabled in your app. Set the sample rate for your transactions by either:

1. Setting a uniform sample rate for all transactions using the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> option in your SDK config to a number between `0` and `1`. (For example, to send 20% of transactions, set <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> to `0.2`.)
2. Controlling the sample rate based on the transaction itself and the context in which it's captured, by providing a function to the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> config option.

The two options are meant to be mutually exclusive. If you set both, <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> will take precedence.

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/configure-sample-rate" />

Learn more about how the options work in <PlatformLink to="/configuration/sampling/">Sampling Transactions</PlatformLink>.

## Verify

<PlatformSection supported={["react-native", "java.spring", "java.spring-boot", "android"]} notSupported={["javascript"]}>

Test out tracing using our <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/">automatic instrumentation</PlatformLink> or by starting and finishing a transaction using <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation/">custom instrumentation</PlatformLink>.

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["dotnet", "go", "java", "android", "ruby", "apple"]} notSupported={["javascript", "react-native", "java.spring", "java.spring-boot"]}>

Test out tracing by starting and finishing a transaction, which you _must_ do so transactions can be sent to Sentry. Learn how in our <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation/">Custom Instrumentation</PlatformLink> content.

</PlatformSection>

Verify that performance monitoring is working correctly by setting <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> to `1.0` as that ensures that every transaction will be sent to Sentry.

Once testing is complete, **we recommend lowering this value in production** by either lowering your <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> value, or switching to using <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> to dynamically sample and filter your transactions.

<PlatformSection supported={["javascript"]} notSupported={["react-native"]}>

Leaving the sample rate at `1.0` means that automatic instrumentation will send a transaction each time a user loads any page or navigates anywhere in your app, which is a lot of transactions. Sampling enables representative data without overwhelming either your system or your Sentry transaction quota.

<PlatformSection notSupported={["javascript", "javascript.cordova"]}>

## Connecting Services

If you are also using Performance Monitoring for [JavaScript](/platforms/javascript/performance/), depending on where your request originates, you can connect traces:

1. For requests that start in your backend, by [adding a meta tag](/platforms/javascript/performance/connect-services/#pageload) in your HTML template that contains tracing information.
2. For requests that start in JavaScript, by the SDK [setting a header](/platforms/javascript/performance/connect-services/#navigation-and-other-xhr-requests) on requests to your backend.

Otherwise, backend services with Performance Monitoring connect automatically.

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["javascript.react"]}>

`@sentry/react` exports a `withProfiler` higher order component that can be used to capture React related spans for specific React components.

```javascript {filename: App.js}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";

export default Sentry.withProfiler(App);
```

Learn more about using and customizing the React Profiler in [Profiler](/platforms/javascript/guides/react/components/profiler/).

## React Router

If you are using `react-router`, we provide <PlatformLink to="/configuration/integrations/react-router/">instrumentation</PlatformLink> to use with our `@sentry/tracing` package.
