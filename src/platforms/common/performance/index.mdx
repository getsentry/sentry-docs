<Alert level="info" title="Do you need to set up?">

The Getting Started page includes code samples that both enable and configure Performance Monitoring, so you don’t need to set up anything further. You can proceed straight to our content about instrumentation.

If you're adding tracing, enable and configure it as documented here. If you’re on a legacy plan, you'll also need to add transaction events to your [subscription](https://sentry.io/pricing/).

</Alert>

With [performance monitoring](/product/performance/), Sentry tracks your software performance, measuring metrics like throughput and latency, and displaying the impact of errors across multiple systems. Sentry captures distributed traces consisting of transactions and spans, which measure individual services and individual operations within those services. Learn more about our model in [Distributed Tracing](/product/performance/distributed-tracing/).

## Enable Tracing

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/enable-tracing" />

</PlatformSection>

## Configure the Sample Rate

Once you configure the <PlatformLink to="/configuration/sampling/">sample rate</PlatformLink>, tracing will be enabled in your app. Set the sample rate for your transactions by either:

1. Setting a uniform sample rate for all transactions using the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> option in your SDK config to a number between `0` and `1`. (For example, to send 20% of transactions, set <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> to `0.2`.)
2. Controlling the sample rate based on the transaction itself and the context in which it's captured, by providing a function to the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> config option.

The two options are meant to be mutually exclusive. If you set both, <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> will take precedence.

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/configure-sample-rate" />

Learn more about how the options work in <PlatformLink to="/configuration/sampling/">Sampling Transactions</PlatformLink>.

## Verify

<PlatformSection supported={["react-native"]} notSupported={["javascript"]}>

You can now test out tracing by adding our <PlatformLink to="/performance/included-instrumentation/">included instrumentation</PlatformLink> or you can learn how to add <PlatformLink to="/performance/custom-instrumentation/">custom instrumentation</PlatformLink>.

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["dotnet"]} notSupported={["javascript", "react-native"]}>

You can now test out tracing by starting and finishing a transaction. You can learn how to do so with <PlatformLink to="/performance/custom-instrumentation/">Custom Instrumentation</PlatformLink>

</PlatformSection>

When you first enable tracing, verify it is working correctly by setting <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> to `1.0` as that ensures that every transaction will be sent to Sentry.

Once testing is complete, **we recommend lowering this value in production** by either lowering your <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> value, or switching to using <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> to dynamically sample and filter your transactions.

<PlatformSection supported={["javascript"]} notSupported={["react-native"]}>

Without sampling, our included instrumentation will send a transaction any time any user loads any page or navigates anywhere in your app, which is a lot of transactions! Sampling enables representative data without overwhelming either your system or your Sentry transaction quota.
