## Group Transactions

When Sentry captures transactions, they are assigned a transaction name. This name is generally auto-generated by the Sentry SDK based on the framework integrations you are using. If you can't leverage the included transaction generation (or want to customize how transaction names are generated) you can use a global event processor that is registered when you initialize the SDK with your configuration.

## Control Data Truncation

Currently, every tag has a maximum character limit of 200 characters. Tags over the 200 character limit will become truncated, losing potentially important information. To retain this data, you can split data over several tags instead.

For example, a 200+ character tagged request:

`https://empowerplant.io/api/0/projects/ep/setup_form/?user_id=314159265358979323846264338327&tracking_id=EasyAsABC123OrSimpleAsDoReMi&product_name=PlantToHumanTranslator&product_id=161803398874989484820458683436563811772030917980576`

The 200+ character request above will become truncated to:

`https://empowerplant.io/api/0/projects/ep/setup_form/?user_id=314159265358979323846264338327&tracking_id=EasyAsABC123OrSimpleAsDoReMi&product_name=PlantToHumanTranslator&product_id=1618033988749894848`
