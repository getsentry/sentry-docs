You can configure your [OpenTelemetry SDK](https://opentelemetry.io/) to send traces and spans to Sentry.

There are multiple ways of configuring your [OpenTelemetry SDK](https://opentelemetry.io/) to send traces and spans to Sentry.

## Preface

Are you already familiar with OpenTelemetry but new to Sentry? Do you find our naming confusing? Here is a little introduction to help you apply your OpenTelemetry knowledge to Sentry.

A `Span` generated by OpenTelemetry may be turned into a Sentry `Transaction` or `Span`. The first OpenTelemetry `Span` that is sent through the Sentry `SpanProcessor` is turned into a Sentry `Transaction`. Any children of this OpenTelemetry `Span `will be attached to this Sentry `Transaction` by looking at the parent span context of the OpenTelemetry `Span`. This happens for the OpenTelemetry root `Span` but also for any `Span` that is the top most `Span` on the current system. For example, you may send a request from your frontend to your backend. The frontend creates an OpenTelemetry root `Span` and a corresponding Sentry `Transaction`. For the outgoing request another OpenTelemetry `Span` is created as child of the root `Span`. Tracing information is passed alongside the request that is sent to the backend. The backend then creates a new Sentry `Transaction` for the OpenTelemetry `Span` that is created from the tracing information. A database call on the backend then creates another OpenTelemetry `Span` which is turned into a Sentry `Span` that is attached to the Sentry `Transaction`. The Sentry transactions created are linked together as a trace which allows you to navigate its transactions. In case an error happens it is linked to the `Transaction` showing you where in the trace the error occurred.

## Using `sentry-opentelemetry-agent` With Auto Initialization

If you use `sentry-opentelemetry-agent`, it will look for `SENTRY_DSN` and `SENTRY_PROPERTIES_FILE` environment variables to be defined, and then initialize Sentry automatically. Only your `DSN` and `tracesSampleRate` need to be configured.

### Debugging

### Turn Off Exporter Error Messages

## Using `sentry-opentelemetry-agent` Without Auto Initialization

You may also disable automatic initialization of Sentry in `sentry-opentelemetry-agent` by setting `SENTRY_AUTO_INIT=false` as environment variable. This means you will either have to use another Sentry integration that performs initialization, for example Spring Boot, or initialize Sentry manually.

## Using OpenTelemetry Without Any Java Agent

If the Java Agent approach is not for you, you may also manually initialize OpenTelemetry. We have a separate dependency for this use case that allows you to reuse classes used by `sentry-opentelemetry-agent`.

### Install

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/opentelemetry-install/without-java-agent" />

### Usage

You will have to configure both OpenTelemetry and Sentry to see transactions in Sentry and have errors linked to transactions created by OpenTelemetry.

## Filtering

In case you want to filter out transactions before sending them to Sentry, for example to get rid of health checks, you can use <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#before-send-transaction"><PlatformIdentifier name="before-send-transaction" /></PlatformLink> to drop them. <PlatformLink to="/configuration/filtering/#using-platformidentifier-namebefore-send-transaction-">Here you can find an example on how to use it</PlatformLink>.
