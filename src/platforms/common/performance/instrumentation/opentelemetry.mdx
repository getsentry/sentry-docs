<Include name="feature-stage-beta-opentelemetry.mdx" />

<PlatformSection notSupported={["java"]}>

You can configure your [OpenTelemetry SDK](https://opentelemetry.io/) to send traces and spans to Sentry.

<PlatformSection supported={["java"]}>

There are multiple ways to configure your [OpenTelemetry SDK](https://opentelemetry.io/) and send traces and spans to Sentry. They're described below.

## Using `sentry-opentelemetry-agent` With Auto Initialization

If you use `sentry-opentelemetry-agent`, it will look for `SENTRY_DSN` and `SENTRY_PROPERTIES_FILE` environment variables to be defined, and then initialize Sentry automatically. You'll just need to configure your `DSN` and `tracesSampleRate` need to be configured.

### Install

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/opentelemetry-install/with-java-agent/with-auto-init" />

### Usage

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/opentelemetry-setup/with-java-agent/with-auto-init" />

### Debugging

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/opentelemetry-setup/with-java-agent/with-auto-init/debugging" />

### Turn Off Exporter Error Messages

## Using `sentry-opentelemetry-agent` Without Auto-Initialization

You may also disable automatic initialization of Sentry in `sentry-opentelemetry-agent` by setting `SENTRY_AUTO_INIT=false` as an environment variable. Doing this will mean you'll either have to use another Sentry integration that performs initialization, (for example Spring Boot), or initialize Sentry manually.

## Using OpenTelemetry Without Any Java Agent

If the Java Agent approach isn't for you, you can manually initialize OpenTelemetry. We have a separate dependency for this use case that allows you to reuse classes used by `sentry-opentelemetry-agent`.

### Install

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/opentelemetry-install/without-java-agent" />

### Usage

You'll have to configure both OpenTelemetry and Sentry to see transactions in Sentry and have errors linked to transactions created by OpenTelemetry.

## OpenTelemetry and Sentry

With Sentryâ€™s OpenTelemetry SDK, an OpenTelemetry `Span` becomes a Sentry `Transaction` or `Span`. The first `Span` sent through the Sentry `SpanProcessor` is a `Transaction`, and any child `Span` gets attached to the first `Transaction` upon checking the parent `Span` context. This is true for the OpenTelemetry root `Span` and any top level `Span` in the system. For example, a request sent from frontend to backend will create an OpenTelemetry root `Span` with a corresponding Sentry `Transaction`. The backend request will create a new Sentry `Transaction` for the OpenTelemetry `Span`. The Sentry `Transaction` and `Span` are linked as a trace for navigation and error tracking purposes.

## Additional Configuration

If you need more fine grained control over Sentry, take a look at the <PlatformLink to="/configuration/">Configuration page</PlatformLink>. In case you'd like to filter out transactions before sending them to Sentry (to get rid of health checks, for example), you may find the <PlatformLink to="/configuration/filtering/#filtering-transaction-events">Filtering page</PlatformLink> helpful.
