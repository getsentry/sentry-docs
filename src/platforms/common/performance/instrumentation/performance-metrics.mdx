description: "Learn how to attach performance metrics to your transactions."
---

Sentry's SDKs support sending performance metrics data to Sentry. These are numeric values attached to transactions that are aggregated and displayed in Sentry.

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/automatic-performance-metrics" />

In addition to automatic performance metrics, the SDK supports setting custom performance metrics on transactions. This allows you to define metrics that are important to your application and send them to Sentry.

To set a performance metric, supply a name (string), value (numeric - float, integer, etc.), and unit (string). Sentry supports adding arbitrary custom units, but we recommend using one of the [supported units listed below](./#supported-performance-metric-units).

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/custom-performance-metrics" />

## Supported Performance Metric Units

Units augment metric values by giving meaning to what otherwise might be abstract numbers. Adding units also allows Sentry to offer controls - unit conversions, filters, etc. - based on those units. For values that are unitless, you can supply an empty string or `none`.

### Duration Units

A time duration.

- `nanosecond`
- `microsecond`
- `millisecond`
- `second`
- `minute`
- `hour`
- `day`
- `week`

### Information Units

Size of information derived from bytes.

- `bit`
- `byte`
- `kilobyte`
- `kibibyte`
- `megabyte`
- `mebibyte`
- `gigabyte`
- `gibibyte`
- `terabyte`
- `tebibyte`
- `petabyte`
- `petabyte`
- `pebibyte`
- `exabyte`
- `exbibyte`

## Fraction Units

- `ratio`
- `percent`

If you want to explore further, you can find details about supported units in our [event ingestion documentation](https://getsentry.github.io/relay/relay_metrics/enum.MetricUnit.html).
