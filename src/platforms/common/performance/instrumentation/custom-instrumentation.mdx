<Note>

To capture transactions customized to your organization's needs, you must first <PlatformLink to="/performance/">set up performance monitoring.</PlatformLink>

</Note>

<PlatformSection supported={["native"]}>

<Note>

Performance monitoring is still an experimental, work-in-progress feature, and its API may be unstable. It may also have bugs. Feedback is appreciated, and should be submitted as an issue in the repository linked on the right side of this page.

</Note>

</PlatformSection>

To instrument certain regions of your code, you can create transactions to capture them.

## Distributed Tracing

Traces can bridge across multiple software services. Each span in a trace can be represented as a `sentry-trace` header, containing the trace id, span id, and sampling details. This `sentry-trace` header can be passed to downstream services so that they can create spans that are a continuation of the trace started in the originating service.
