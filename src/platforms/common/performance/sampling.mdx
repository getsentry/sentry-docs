You can control the volume of transactions sent to Sentry in two ways.

## Uniform Sample Rate

Setting a uniform sample rate is a good option if you want an even cross-section of transactions, no matter where in your app or under what circumstances they occur, and are happy with the default inheritance and precedence behavior described below.

To do this, set the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> option in your `Sentry.init()` to a number between 0 and 1. With this option set, every transaction created will have that percentage chance of being sent to Sentry. (So, for example, if you set <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> to `0.2`, approximately 20% of your transactions will get recorded and sent.) That looks like this:

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/uniform-sample-rate" />

## Dynamic Sampling Function

Providing a sampling function is a good option if you:

- want to sample different transactions at different rates
- want to filter out some transactions entirely
- want to modify the default precedence and inheritance behavior described below

To sample dynamically, set the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> option in your `Sentry.init()` to a function that will accept a `samplingContext` object and return a sample rate between 0 and 1. For example:

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/dynamic-sampling-function" />

For convenience, the function can also return a boolean. Returning `true` is equivalent to returning `1`, and will guarantee the transaction will be sent to Sentry. Returning `false` is equivalent to returning `0` and will guarantee the transaction will **not** be sent to Sentry.

### Default Sampling Context Data

The information contained in the <PlatformIdentifier name="sampling-context" /> object passed to the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> when a transaction is created varies by platform and integration.

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/default-sampling-context" />

### Custom Sampling Context Data

When manually creating a transaction, you can add data to the <PlatformIdentifier name="sampling-context" /> by passing it as an optional second argument to <PlatformIdentifier name="start-transaction" />. This is useful if there's data to which you want the sampler to have access but which you don't want to attach to the transaction as `tags` or `data`, such as information that's sensitive or thatâ€™s too large to send with the transaction. For example:

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/custom-sampling-context" />

## Inheritance

Whatever a transaction's sampling decision, that decision will be passed to its child spans and from there to any transactions they subsequently cause in other services. (See [Connecting Backend and Frontend Transactions](/platforms/javascript/performance/) for more about how that propagation is done.)

If the transaction currently being created is one of those subsequent transactions (in other words, if it has a parent transaction), the upstream (parent) sampling decision will always be included in the sampling context data, so that your <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> can choose whether and when to inherit that decision. (In most cases, inheritance is the right choice, so that you don't end up with partial traces.)

For convenience, the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> function can return a boolean, so that a parent's decision can be returned directly if that's the desired behavior.

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/always-inherit-sampling-decision" />

If you're using a <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> rather than a <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" />, the decision will always be inherited.

## Forcing a Sampling Decision

If you know at transaction creation time whether or not you want the transaction sent to Sentry, you also have the option of passing a sampling decision directly to the transaction constructor (note, not in the <PlatformIdentifier name="custom-sampling-context" /> object). If you do that, the transaction won't be subject to the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" />, nor will <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> be run, so you can count on the decision that's passed not to be overwritten.

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/force-sampling-decision" />

## Precedence

There are multiple ways for a transaction to end up with a sampling decision.

- Random sampling according to a static sample rate set in <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" />
- Random sampling according to a dynamic sample rate returned by <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" />
- Absolute decision (100% chance or 0% chance) returned by <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" />
- If the transaction has a parent, inheriting its parent's sampling decision
- Absolute decision passed to <PlatformIdentifier name="start-transaction" />

When there's the potential for more than one of these to come into play, the following precedence rules apply:

1. If a sampling decision is passed to <PlatformIdentifier name="start-transaction" /> (see [Forcing a Sampling Decision](#forcing-a-sampling-decision) above), that decision will be used, regardlesss of anything else
2. If <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> is defined, its decision will be used. It can choose to keep or ignore any parent sampling decision, or use the sampling context data to make its own decision or choose a sample rate for the transaction.
3. If <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> is not defined, but there's a parent sampling decision, the parent sampling decision will be used.
4. If <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> is not defined and there's no parent sampling decision, <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> will be used.
