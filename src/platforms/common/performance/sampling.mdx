You can control the volume of transactions sent to Sentry in two ways.

## Uniform Sample Rate

Setting a uniform sample rate is a good option if you want an even cross-section of transactions, no matter where in your app or under what circumstances they occur, and are happy with the default inheritance and precedence behavior described below.

To do this, set the `tracesSampleRate` option in your `Sentry.init()` to a number between 0 and 1. With this option set, every transaction created will have that percentage chance of being sent to Sentry. (So, for example, if you set `tracesSampleRate` to `0.2`, approximately 20% of your transactions will get recorded and sent.) That looks like this:

```javascript {tabTitle: ESM}
// If you're using one of our integration packages, like `@sentry/react` or `@sentry/angular`,
// substitute its name for `@sentry/browser` here
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";

// If taking advantage of automatic instrumentation (highly recommended)
import { Integrations as TracingIntegrations } from "@sentry/tracing";
// Or, if only doing manual tracing
// import * as _ from "@sentry/tracing"
// Note: You MUST import the package in some way for tracing to work

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // This enables automatic instrumentation (highly recommeneded), but is not
  // necessary for purely manual usage
  integrations: [new TracingIntegrations.BrowserTracing()],

  // Each transaction has a 20% chance of being sent to Sentry
  tracesSampleRate: 0.2,
});
```

```javascript {tabTitle: CDN}
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // This enables automatic instrumentation (highly recommeneded), but is not
  // necessary for purely manual usage
  integrations: [new Sentry.Integrations.BrowserTracing()],

  // Each transaction has a 20% chance of being sent to Sentry
  tracesSampleRate: 0.2,
});
```

## Dynamic Sampling Function

Providing a sampling function is a good option if you:

- want to sample different transactions at different rates
- want to filer out some transactions entirely
- want to modify the default precedence and inheritance behavior described below

To sample dynamically, set the `tracesSampler` option in your `Sentry.init()` to a function that will accept a `samplingContext` object and return a sample rate between 0 and 1. For example:

```javascript
tracesSampler: samplingContext => {
  // Examine provided context data (including parent decision, if any) along with anything
  // in the global namespace to compute the sample rate or sampling decision for this transaction.

  if ("...") {
    return 0.5; // These are important - take a big sample
  } else if ("...") {
    return 0.01; // These are less important or happen much more frequently - only take 1% of them
  } else if ("...") {
    return 0; // These aren't something worth tracking - drop all transactions like this
  } else {
    return 0.1; // Default sample rate
  }
};
```

For convenience, the function can also return a boolean. Returning `true` is equivalent to returning `1`, and will guarantee the transaction will be sent to Sentry. Returning `false` is equivalent to returning `0` and will guarantee the transaction will **not** be sent to Sentry.

### Default Sampling Context Data

The information contained in the `samplingContext` object passed to the `tracesSampler` when a transaction is created varies by platform.

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/default-sampling-context" />

### Custom Sampling Context Data

When manually creating a transaction, you can add data to the `samplingContext` by passing it as an optional second argument to `startTransaction()`. This is useful if there's data to which you want the sampler to have access but which you don't want to attach to the transaction as `tags` or `data`, such as information that's sensitive or thatâ€™s too large to send with the transaction. For example:

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/custom-sampling-context" />

## Inheritance

Whatever a transaction's sampling decision, that decision will be passed to its child spans and from there to any transactions they subsequently cause in other services. (See [Connecting Backend and Frontend Transactions](/platforms/javascript/performance/) for more about how that propogation is done.)

If the transaction currently being created is one of those subsequent transactions (in other words, if it has a parent transaction), the upstream (parent) sampling decision will always be included in the sampling context data, so that your `tracesSampler` can choose whether and when to inherit that decision. (In most cases, inheritance is the right choice, so that you don't end up with partial traces.)

For convenience, the `tracesSampler` function can return a boolean, so that a parent's decision can be returned directly if that's the desired behavior.

```javascript
tracesSampler: samplingContext => {
  // always inherit
  if (samplingContext.parentSampled !== undefined) {
    return samplingContext.parentSampled
  }

  ...
  // rest of sampling logic here
}
```

If you're using a `tracesSampleRate` rather than a `tracesSampler`, the decision will always be inherited.

## Forcing a Sampling Decision

If you know at transaction creation time whether or not you want the transaction sent to Sentry, you also have the option of passing a sampling decision directly to the transaction in the `transactionContext` object (note, not the `customSamplingContext` object). If you do that, the transaction won't be subject to the `tracesSampleRate`, nor will `tracesSampler` be run, so you can count on the decision that's passed not to be overwritten.

```javascript
Sentry.startTransaction({
  name: "Search from navbar",
  sampled: true,
});
```

## Precedence

There are multiple ways for a transaction to end up with a sampling decision.

- Random sampling according to a static sample rate set in `tracesSampleRate`
- Random sampling according to a dynamic sample rate returned by `tracesSampler`
- Absolute decision (100% chance or 0% chance) returned by `tracesSampler`
- If the transaction has a parent, inheriting its parent's sampling decision
- Absolute decision passed to `startTransaction`

When there's the potential for more than one of these to come into play, the following precedence rules apply:

1. If a sampling decision is passed to `startTransaction` (`startTransaction({name: "my transaction", sampled: true})`), that decision will be used, regardlesss of anything else
2. If `tracesSampleRate` is defined, its decision will be used. It can choose to keep or ignore any parent sampling decision, or use the sampling context data to make its own decision or choose a sample rate for the transaction.
3. If `tracesSampler` is not defined, but there's a parent sampling decision, the parent sampling decision will be used.
4. If `tracesSampler` is not defined and there's no parent sampling decision, `tracesSampleRate` will be used.
