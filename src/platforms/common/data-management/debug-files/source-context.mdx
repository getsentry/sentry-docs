If Sentry has access to application source code, it can show snippets of code
around the location of stack frames. Certain SDKs can resolve this source
context automatically, such as the Python SDK, because they have access to
unobfuscated source code at runtime.

By contrast, to get source context for compiled applications, the source code
needs to be uploaded alongside the debug information files.
The recommended way to do this is by using `sentry-cli`.
See [Creating Source Bundles](/product/cli/dif/#creating-source-bundles) for more information.

<Note>

For .NET projects, you can [configure MSBuild](../../../configuration/msbuild/) to
call `sentry-cli` automatically.  Enable the `SentryUploadSources` property to
create and upload source bundles automatically while uploading symbols.

After they've been uploaded you can review and manage source bundles the same as
any other debug information file.  See [Managing Debug Information Files](../#managing-debug-information-files).
Source bundles will be tagged with `sources`, and will carry the same filename as the
respective debug information file they were created from.
