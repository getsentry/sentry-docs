Sentry differentiates four kinds of debug information:

- **Debug Information:** Provides function names, paths to source files, line
  numbers, and inline frames. The process of resolving this information from
  instruction addresses is called "symbolication". This information is
  relatively large compared to the executable and usually put into a separate
  file. In Sentry, these files are designated as _debug companions_ and show the
  `debug` tag.

- **Symbol Tables:** If debug information is not available for a certain
  library, Sentry can use symbol tables as a fallback to retrieve function
  names. Symbol tables are usually included in both the executable and debug
  companion files. However, they do not contain sufficient information to
  resolve inline functions or file names and line numbers. The `symtab` tag
  indicates symbol tables.

- **Source Code:** Conventionally, source code is not part of regular debug
  information files. Sentry CLI can bundle source code of your application and
  upload it to display source context in stack traces in Sentry. These bundles
  show up with the `sources` tag.

- **Unwind Information:** Enables Sentry to extract stack traces from Minidumps
  and other binary crash formats of optimized builds. This process is referred
  to as "stack unwinding" or "stack walking". Since this is also required when
  throwing exceptions in C++, this information is often included in the
  executable or library. If an uploaded file contains this information, it shows
  the `unwind` tag. Note that on some platforms no actual unwinding takes place.
  For instance, WebAssembly currently does not have the equivalent of minidumps
  which means we do not require that type of information in such cases.

Compilers place the above debug information in different files passed on the
target platform, architecture, build flags or optimization level. Consequently,
Sentry might not need all of the above information to process crash reports.
Still, it is always a good idea to provide all available debug information.

`sentry-cli` can be used to list properties of supported debug files and
validate their contents. See [_Debug Information Files in sentry-cli_](/product/cli/dif/) for more information.

## MachO and dSYM

Executables, dynamic libraries and debug companions on all Apple platforms use
the _Mach Object_, or short _MachO_, container format. This applies to iOS,
iPadOS, tvOS, watchOS, and macOS.

- **Executables** do not carry a file extension. For desktop applications, they
  are often placed in app bundle structures with the `.app` suffix. Unless
  stripped manually, executables contain unwind information and a symbol table.
  Debug information is never stored in executables.

- **Dynamic Libraries** use the `.dylib` extension, and otherwise behave exactly
  the same as executables.

- **Debug Companions** are placed in a folder structure with the `.dSYM`
  extension, and are located at `<name>.dSYM/Contents/Resources/DWARF/<name>`.
  They usually contain a symbol table and debug information, but rarely unwind
  information.

When building an application with Xcode or with the `clang` compiler, debug
information is automatically placed in a dSYM file. When linking manually,
however, the dSYM file must be created using the following command:

```bash
dsymutil /path/to/output[.dylib]
```

## Executable and Linkable Format (ELF)

On Linux distributions, executables and debug information are stored in _ELF_
containers. Unlike other platforms, there is no dedicated container or specifier
for debug companion files.

Debug information is part of the binary (executable or library) and stripped
when generating release builds due to their size. However, there is a way to
retain them in a separate file (either in a different location or with `.debug`
extension):

```bash
# There is an executable called "binary" in the CWD
objcopy --only-keep-debug binary binary.debug
objcopy --strip-debug --strip-unneeded binary
objcopy --add-gnu-debuglink=binary.debug binary
```

This results in the following structure:

- **Executables** do not carry a file extension. If stripped like above,
  executables contain a symbol table, but no debug information. If the build
  run omits frame pointers, unwind information will also be retained. Both can
  be further stripped using flags like `--strip-all`.

- **Shared Libraries** use the `.so` extension, and otherwise behave exactly
  the same as executables.

- **Debug Companions** do not carry a standard file extension, but are often
  named `.debug`. If stripped like above, these files contain unwind
  information, debug information and a symbol table.

Shared libraries installed via package managers usually provide their debugging
information in separate `*-dev` packages and put it in locations like
`/usr/local/debug/...`. To receive symbolicated stack traces from those
libraries, make sure to also upload their symbols in addition to your appâ€™s
symbols.

ELF supports the compression of debug information which can significantly reduce
the time required to upload debug information files to Sentry and thus improve
build times. `gcc` (version 5 or newer) and `clang` (version 5 or newer) support
this by passing the `-gz` flag to both the compiler and linker. The common way
to compress debug information, however, is when stripping the executable:

```bash
# Note the --compress-debug-sections option
objcopy --only-keep-debug --compress-debug-sections=zlib binary binary.debug
```

This can be verified by checking for the `C` flag in `readelf`, corresponding to
`SHF_COMPRESSED`:

```bash
readelf -S path/to/file
  ...
  [21] .debug_info       PROGBITS         0000000000000000  00000370
       000000000000e133  0000000000000000   C       0     0     1
```

## PE and PDB

On Microsoft Windows, executables and dynamic libraries use the _Portable
Executable_ container, in short _PE_. Debug information is stored in _Program
Database_ files, commonly referred to as _PDB_.

- **Executables** use an `.exe` file extension. Only when compiled for 64-bit
  architectures, they contain unwind information. Otherwise, they do not contain
  any usable information and will be omitted for the upload to Sentry.

- **Dynamic Libraries** use the `.dll` file extension, and otherwise behave
  exactly the same as executables.

- **Debug Companions** are stored in `.pdb` files. They usually contain debug
  information and in most cases symbol tables. For 32-bit programs, they also
  contain unwind information. In rare cases, they might have different file
  names than their corresponding executable.

<Note>

Currently, Sentry supports only Native PDBs. PDBs for the .NET platform are not supported.

## Breakpad Symbols

The Google Breakpad library has established a platform-independent ASCII format
to store debug information. Such files are usually generated for applications
using Breakpad, Crashpad, or the Electron Framework.

The Breakpad repository includes `dump_syms` tools for each platform that can
convert from native debug files to Breakpad symbols. These converters bundle all
available information into one file, such that only one file needs to be
uploaded.

In contrast to native debug files, Breakpad symbols discard a lot of information
that is not required to process minidumps. Most notably, inline functions are
not declared, such that Sentry is not able to display inline frames in stack
traces.

## WASM

</PlatformSection>

For WebAssembly, we support [DWARF in WASM containers](https://yurydelendik.github.io/webassembly-dwarf/).
Note that we do not support source maps, which are also a format used for WASM
debugging, but have shortcomings that make them impractical for a crash reporting
tool like Sentry.

Since WASM does not specify debug/build IDs yet, we provide a separate tool to
add build IDs and split files called [wasm-split](https://github.com/getsentry/symbolicator/tree/master/wasm-split)
to help you create a debug companion file ready for uploading to Sentry
while removing all debug information from the release binary.

## ProGuard Mappings

<PlatformSection supported={["android", "flutter", "react-native"]}>
<Note>

The recommended method for [Android users is to use the Gradle plugin](/platforms/android/proguard/).

</Note>
</PlatformSection>

ProGuard mapping files allow Sentry to resolve obfuscated Java classpaths and
method names into their original form. In that sense, they act as debug
information files for Java and Android applications.
