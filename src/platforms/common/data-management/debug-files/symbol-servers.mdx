Sentry can download debug information files from external repositories. This
allows you to stop uploading debug files and instead configure a public symbol
server or run your own. It is also possible to configure external repositories
and upload debug files at the same time.

To configure external repositories, go to **Project Settings > Debug Files**.
Above the list of uploaded files, there are two settings to configure external
repositories:

1. **Custom Repositories:** Configures custom repositories containing debug
   files. You can choose from configuring an HTTP symbol server, Amazon S3
   bucket or Google Cloud Storage bucket. This requires a _Business_ or
   _Enterprise_ plan.

2. **Built-In Repositories:** Allows to select from a list of pre-configured
   symbol servers. By default, _iOS_ and _Microsoft_ are enabled.

Sentry queries external repositories for debug information files in the order
they are configured. If custom repositories are configured, those are probed
first. Only debug information files that are not found on one of the custom
repositories are queried from the built-in ones.

## Built-In Repositories

To enable a built-in repository, select it from the dropdown list. This
immediately adds the repository and uses its debug information files to
symbolicate new crash reports. Likewise, any built-in repository can be disabled
by clicking on the X next to the name.

Adding or removing external repositories applies immediately. As a result,
events may group differently with the new information and create new issues.
Beware that these cause notifications to your team members.

## Custom Repositories

<Alert title="Note" level="info">

Custom repositories are available for organizations on the _Business_ and
_Enterprise_ plans.

</Alert>

Independent of the internal format, Sentry supports three kinds of custom
repositories:

- **HTTP Symbol Server**: An HTTP server that serves debug files at a
  configurable path. Lookups in the server should generally be case-insensitive,
  although an explicit casing can be configured in the settings.

- **Amazon S3 Bucket**: Either an entire S3 bucket or a subdirectory. This
  requires `s3:GetObject`, and optionally `s3:ListBucket` permissions for the
  configured Access Key. Lookups in the bucket are case sensitive, which is why
  we recommend storing all files lower-cased.

- **Google Cloud Storage Bucket**: Either an entire GCS bucket or a
  subdirectory. This requires `storage.objects.get` and `storage.objects.list`
  permissions for the configured service account. Lookups in the bucket are case
  sensitive, which is why we recommend storing all files lower-cased.

Apart from authentication configuration, all types have common config
parameters:

1. **Name**: A name to identify the repository.

2. **Path Casing**: Overrides which casing Sentry uses to query for debug
   information files. The default is a mixed case, which will use the case
   described in the next section. When overridden, all access is either
   lowercased or uppercased. Defaults to _"mixed case"_.

3. **Directory Layout**: The internal structure of the bucket, or the protocol
   of the symbol server. There are three layouts to choose from which are
   discussed in the next section. Defaults to _"Platform Specific"_.

## Compression of Debug Files

Sentry supports the following compression methods when downloading debug
information files from external sources: Gzip, zlib (both with and
without header), Zstandard, and Cabinet (CAB).

The convention on Microsoft's Symbol Server protocol is to store such files with
the last character of the file extension replaced with `_`. A full example would
be: `KERNEL32.dll/590285E9e0000/KERNEL32.dl_`. This is not required on your own
repositories, as Sentry detects compression on all paths.

## Directory Layouts

Sentry supports multiple layouts for external repositories. Based on the
selected layout and the file type, we try to download files at specific paths.

The following table contains a mapping from the supported layouts to file path
schemas applied for specific files:

| Layout                          | MachO   |   ELF   |    PE    |   PDB    | Breakpad | WASM    |
| ------------------------------- | :-----: | :-----: | :------: | :------: | :------: | :-----: |
| Platform-Specific               | LLDB    | BuildID | SymStore | SymStore | Breakpad | BuildID |
| Microsoft SymStore              |   -     |    -    | SymStore | SymStore |    -     | -       |
| Microsoft SymStore (index2.txt) |   -     |    -    |  Index2  |  Index2  |    -     | -       |
| Microsoft SSQP                  | SSQP    |  SSQP   |   SSQP   |   SSQP   |    -     | -       |
| Unified Symbol Server Layout    | Unified | Unified | Unified  | Unified  | Unified  | Unified |

The path schemas in the table above are defined as follows:

### Breakpad

Path: `<DebugName>/<BREAKPADid>/<SymName>`

Breakpad always uses a _Breakpad ID_ to store symbols. These identifiers can
be computed from _Debug Identifiers_ by removing dashes and applying the
following casing rules:

- The signature part of the id (first 32 characters) are **uppercase**.
- The age part of the id (remaining characters) are **lowercase**.

The name of the symbol file is platform dependent. On Windows, the file
extension (Either `.exe`, `.dll` or `.pdb`) is replaced with `.sym`. On all
other platforms, the `.sym` extension is **appended** to the full file name
including potential extensions.

Examples:

- `wkernel32.pdb/FF9F9F7841DB88F0CDEDA9E1E9BFF3B51/wkernel32.sym`
- `MyFramework.dylib/5E012A646CC536F19B4DA0564049169B/MyFramework.dylib.sym`

### LLDB

Path: `XXXX/XXXX/XXXX/XXXX/XXXX/XXXXXXXXXXXX[.app]`

The LLDB debugger on macOS can read debug symbols from [File Mapped UUID
Directories](https://lldb.llvm.org/use/symbols.html#file-mapped-uuid-directories).
The UUID is broken up by splitting the first 20 hex digits into 4 character
chunks, and a directory is created for each chunk. In the final directory,
LLDB usually expects a symlink named by the last 12 hex digits, which it
follows to the actual dSYM file.

This is not actually an LLVM feature. This is in fact a feature of
`CoreFoundation` and exclusively implemented on macOS on top of spotlight.
Spotlight indexes these paths and the private `DBGCopyFullDSYMURLForUUID` API
is used by lldb to locate the symbols. macOS uses the symlinks of those
locations.

Since the executable or library shares the same UUID as the dSYM file, the
former are distinguished with a `.app` suffix.

The hex digits are **uppercase**, the app suffix is **lowercase**.

Examples:

- `5E01/2A64/6CC5/36F1/9B4D/A0564049169B` (debug companion)
- `5E01/2A64/6CC5/36F1/9B4D/A0564049169B.app` (executable or library)

### BuildID

Path: `nn/nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn...[.debug]`

GDB supports multiple lookup methods, depending on the way the debug info file
is specified. Sentry uses the [Build ID Method]: Assuming that a GNU build ID
note or section has been written to the ELF file, this specifies a unique
identifier for the executable which is also retained in the debug file.

The GNU build ID is a variable-length binary string, usually consisting of a
20-byte SHA1 hash of the code section (`.text`). The lookup path is
_pp/nnnnnnnn.debug_, where _pp_ are the first 2 hex characters of the build ID
bit string, and _nnnnnnnn_ are the rest of the hex string. To look up
executables, the `.debug` suffix is omitted.

Examples:

- `b5/381a457906d279073822a5ceb24c4bfef94ddb` (executable or library)
- `b5/381a457906d279073822a5ceb24c4bfef94ddb.debug` (stripped debug file)

**Unified**

: Path: `nn/nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn.../type`

The unified path layout is specific to Sentry and enables a consistent
structure for all debug files independent of platform.  It can store breakpad files,
PDBs, PEs, and everything else.  The [symsorter tool](https://github.com/getsentry/symbolicator/tree/master/symsorter)
can automatically sort debug symbols into this format and also automatically
create source bundles.

The path is based on a `build_id` formatted to a hexadecimal using
lower case.  The first two bytes of that ID are taken as a root folder.

The `build_id` construction differs among file formats:

- PE: `<Signature><Age>` (age in hex, not padded)
- PDB: `<Signature><Age>` (age in hex, not padded)
- ELF: the gnu-build-id code note byte sequence.
- MachO: `LC_UUID` bytes
- WASM: `build_id` section as bytes

Examples:

- `b5/381a457906d279073822a5ceb24c4bfef94ddb/executable` (executable or library)
- `b5/381a457906d279073822a5ceb24c4bfef94ddb/debuginfo` (debug file)
- `b5/381a457906d279073822a5ceb24c4bfef94ddb/breakpad` (breakpad file)
- `b5/381a457906d279073822a5ceb24c4bfef94ddb/sourcebundle` (source bundle)

### SSQP

Path: `<file_name>/<prefix>-<identifier>/<file_name>`

[SSQP Key Conventions] are an extension to the original Microsoft Symbol
Server protocol for .NET. It specifies lookup paths for PE, PDB, MachO and ELF
files. The case of all lookup paths is generally **lowercase** except for the
age field of PDB identifiers which should be **uppercase**.

For MachO files and ELF files, SSQP specifies to use the same identifiers as
used in the LLDB and GNU build id method, respectively. See the sections above
for more information. This results in the following paths for all possible
file types:

- `<code_name>/<timestamp><size_of_image>/<code_name>`
  (PE file)
- `<debug_name>/<signature><AGE>/<debug_name>` (PDB
  file)
- `<code_name>/elf-buildid-<buildid>/<code_name>` (ELF
  binary)
- `_.debug/elf-buildid-sym-<buildid>/_.debug` (ELF debug file)
- `<code_name>/mach-uuid-<uuid>/<code_name>` (MachO binary)
- `_.dwarf/mach-uuid-sym-<uuid>/_.dwarf` (MachO binary)

SSQP specifies an additional lookup method by SHA1 checksum over the
file contents, commonly used for source file lookups. _Sentry does not support
this lookup method._

Examples:

- `wkernel32.pdb/ff9f9f7841db88f0cdeda9e1e9bff3b5A/wkernel32.pdb`
- `kernel32.dll/590285e9e0000/kernel32.dll`
- `libc-2.23.so/elf-buildid-b5381a457906d279073822a5ceb24c4bfef94ddb/libc-2.23.so`
- `_.debug/elf-buildid-sym-b5381a457906d279073822a5ceb24c4bfef94ddb/_.debug`
- `CoreFoundation/mach-uuid-36385a3a60d332dbbf55c6d8931a7aa6/CoreFoundation`
- `_.dwarf/mach-uuid-sym-36385a3a60d332dbbf55c6d8931a7aa6/_.dwarf`

### SymStore

Path: `<FileName>/<SIGNATURE><AGE>/<FileName>`

The public symbol server provided by Microsoft used to only host PDBs for the
Windows platform. These use a _signature-age_ debug identifier in addition to
the file name to locate symbols. File paths are identical to SSQP, except for
the default casing rules:

- Filenames are **as given**
- The signature and age of a PDB identifier are **uppercase**.
- The timestamp of a PE identifier is **uppercase**, but the size is
  **lowercase**.

Since the original Microsoft Symbol Server did not serve ELF or MachO files,
we do not recommend using this convention for these types. However, Sentry
will support the SSQP conventions with adapted casing rules when this layout
is selected.

Examples:

- `wkernel32.pdb/FF9F9F7841DB88F0CDEDA9E1E9BFF3B5A/wkernel32.pdb`
- `KERNEL32.dll/590285E9e0000/KERNEL32.dll`

### Index2

Path: `<Fi>/<FileName>/<SIGNATURE><AGE>/<FileName>`

This layout is identical to _SymStore_, except that the first two characters
of the file name are prepended to the path as an additional folder.

Examples:

- `wk/wkernel32.pdb/FF9F9F7841DB88F0CDEDA9E1E9BFF3B5A/wkernel32.pdb`
- `KE/KERNEL32.dll/590285E9e0000/KERNEL32.dll`
