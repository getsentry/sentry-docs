If you use stack traces for grouping, the stack trace rules (previously known as grouping enhancements) influence the data that feed into that algorithm. These rules can be configured on a per-project basis under **Settings > Projects > [project] > Issue Grouping > Stack Trace Rules**.

Each line is a single rule; one or multiple match expressions are followed by one or multiple actions to be executed when all expressions match. All rules are executed from top to bottom on all frames in the stack trace.

The syntax for stack trace rules is similar to:

<PlatformContent includePath="grouping/basic/" />

The syntax follows the syntax from [Discover queries](/product/discover-queries/). If you want to negate the match, you can prefix the expression with an exclamation mark (`!`).

The following is a practical example of how this looks:

<PlatformContent includePath="grouping/example/" />

## Matchers

Multiple matchers can be defined in a line. The following matchers are available:

<DefinitionList>

### `family`

Matches on the general platform family, which currently includes `javascript`, `native` and `other`. Comma separate rules to apply them to multiple platforms.

<PlatformContent includePath="grouping/family/" />

### `stack.abs_path`

alias: `path`

This matcher is case insensitive with Unix glob behavior on a path in a stack trace. The path separators are normalized to `/`. As a special rule, if the filename is relative, it still matches on `**/`.

<PlatformContent includePath="grouping/path/" />

### `stack.module`

alias: `module`

Module is similar to `path` but matches on the `module`. This is not used for Native but it is used for JavaScript, Python, and similar platforms. Matches are case sensitive, and normal globbing is available. Note that modules are not packages, which can be confusing for Native environments.

### `stack.function`

alias: `function`

Matches on a function in a stack trace, and is case sensitive with normal globbing.

<PlatformContent includePath="grouping/function" />

### `stack.package`

alias: `package`

Matches on a package in a stack trace. The package is the container that contains a function or module. This is a `.jar`, a `.dylib` or similar. The same matching rules as for `path` apply. For example, this is typically an absolute path.

<PlatformContent includePath="grouping/package/" />

### `app`

Matches on the current state of the in-app flag of a stack trace frame. `yes` means the frame is in-app, `no` means it's not.

</DefinitionList>

## Actions

There are two types of **actions**: flag and variables setting.

1. A **flag** identifies the action to be taken if all matchers match and uses these prefixes:

- `+` sets the flag
- `-` unsets the flag
- `^`applies to frames above the matching frame (toward the crash.
- `v` applies to frames below the matching frame (away from the crash)

As an example, `-group ^-group` removes the matching frame and all frames above it from the grouping.

- `app`: marks or unmarks a frame in-app
- `group`: adds or removes a frame from grouping

2. **variables**: Variables can be set (`variable=value`). Currently, there is just one:

- `max-frames`: sets the total number of frames to be considered for grouping. The default is `0`, which means "all frames." If set to `3`, only the top three frames are considered.

If a line is prefixed with a hash (`#`), it's a comment and ignored.

## Recommendations

These recommendations will greatly improve your out-of-the-box grouping experience.

### Mark in-app Frames

To proactively improve your experience, help Sentry determine which frames in your stack trace are "in-app" (part of your own application) and which are not. The SDK defines the default rules, but in many cases, this can be improved on the server as well. In particular, for languages where server-side processing is necessary (for example, Native C, C++, or JavaScript), it's better to override this on the server.

<PlatformContent includePath="grouping/in-app" />

<PlatformContent includePath="grouping/not-in-app" />

### Cut Stack Traces

In many cases, you want to remove the top or bottom of the stack trace. For instance, many code bases use a common function to generate an error. In this case, the error machinery will appear as part of the stack trace.

<PlatformContent includePath="grouping/remove-frames" />

Here we tell the system that all frames from `begin-panic` to the crash location are not part of the application (including the panic frame itself). All frames above are, in all cases, irrelevant for grouping.

Likewise, you can also remove the base of a stack trace. This is particularly useful if you have different main loops that drive an application:

<PlatformContent includePath="grouping/remove-frames" />

### Stack Trace Frame Limits

This isn't useful for _all_ projects, but it can work well for large applications with many crashes. The default strategy is to consider most of the stack trace relevant for grouping. This means that every different stack trace that leads to a crashing function will cause a different group to be created. If you do not want that, you can force the groups to be much larger by limiting how many frames should be considered.

<PlatformContent includePath="grouping/max-frames" />
