title: "Server-side Fingerprinting"
sidebar_order: 1
---

Server-side fingerprinting is also configured with a config similar to
[grouping enhancements](/data-management/event-grouping/grouping-enhancements/),
but the syntax is slightly different. The matchers are the same
but instead of flipping flags, a fingerprint is assigned that overrides the
default grouping entirely.

These rules can be configured on a per-project basis under _Project Settings > General Settings > Grouping Settings_. You are presented with an input field where you can write custom
fingerprinting rules. The syntax follows the syntax from Discover queries. If
you want to negate the match, you can prefix the expression with an
exclamation mark (`!`).

All values are matched against, and in the case of stack traces, all frames are considered.
If all matches in a line match, then the fingerprint is applied.

```discover {tabTitle:Fingerprinting Config}
# You can use comments to explain the rules.  Rules themselves follow the
# following syntax:
matcher:expression -> list, of, values
```

This list of values can be hardcoded values or alternatively some variables
whch are substituded.

This is a practical example, which groups exceptions of a specific type
together:

```discover {tabTitle:Fingerprinting Config}
error.type:DatabaseUnavailable -> system-down
error.type:ConnectionError -> system-down

error.value:"connection error: *" -> connection-error, {{ transaction }}
```

## Matchers

All values are matched against, and in the case of stack traces, all frames are considered.
If all matches in a line match, then the fingerprint is applied. The syntax follows
the syntax from Discover queries. If you want to negate the match, you can prefix
the expression with an exclamation mark (`!`).

Matchers generally use globbing syntax. The following matchers are available:

<DefinitionList>

### `error.type`

alias: `type`

Matches on an exception type (exception name). The match is performed as a case
sensitive glob.

```discover {tabTitle:Fingerprinting Config}
error.type:ZeroDivisionError -> zero-division
error.type:ConnectionError -> connection-error
```

### `error.value`

alias: `value`

Matches on the exception value. Errors or exceptions often have human readable
descriptions (values) associated with them. This matcher allows a case
insensitive match.

```discover {tabTitle:Fingerprinting Config}
error.value:"connection error (code: *)" -> connection-error
error.value:"could not connect (*)" -> connection-error
```

### `message`

This matcher matches on a log message. It will also automatically check for
the additional exception value as they can be hard to keep apart. The matching
is done case insensitive.

```discover {tabTitle:Fingerprinting Config}
message:"system encountered a fatal problem: *" -> fatal-log
```

### `logger`

Matches on the name of the logger, which is useful to combine all messages of a
logger together. This match is case sensitive.

```discover {tabTitle:Fingerprinting Config}
logger:"com.myapp.mypackage.*" -> mypackage-logger
```

### `level`

Matches on the log level. The match is case insensitive.

```discover {tabTitle:Fingerprinting Config}
logger:"com.myapp.FooLogger" level:"error" -> mylogger-error
```

### `tags.tag_name`

Matches on the value of the tag `tag_name`. This can be useful to filter down
certain types of events. For instance, you can separate out events caused by a
certain server:

```discover {tabTitle:Fingerprinting Config}
tags.server_name:"canary-*.mycompany.internal" -> canary-events
```

### `stack.abs_path`

alias: `path`

This matcher is case insensitive matching on the path of an event. It uses path
globbing semantics which means that `*` does not match a slash but `**` does.
Note that this matcher actually matches on both `abs_path` and `filename` as
SDKs can be quite inconsistent about how these values are supported. If the
glob matches on either of these values it's considered a match.

```discover {tabTitle:Fingerprinting Config}
stack.abs_path:"**/my-utils/*.js" -> my-utils, {{ error.type }}
```

### `stack.module`

alias: `module`

This matcher is similar to `stack.abs_path` but matches on the module name
instead. The match is case sensitive and regular globbing rules
apply (`*` also matches slashes).

```discover {tabTitle:Fingerprinting Config}
stack.module:"*/my-utils/*" -> my-utils, {{ error.type }}
```

### `stack.function`

alias: `function`

This matcher checks if any of the functions in the stack trace match the
glob. The match is case sensitive:

```discover {tabTitle:Fingerprinting Config}
stack.function:"my_assertion_failed" -> my-assertion-failed
```

### `stack.package`

alias: `package`

This matcher matches on the "package" of a frame. This is typically the name of
the debug symbol / object file that contains a frame. If any of the frames match
this object file then it matches.

```discover {tabTitle:Fingerprinting Config}
stack.package:"**/libcurl.dylib" -> libcurl
stack.package:"**/libcurl.so" -> libcurl
```

### `family`

This matcher can be used to "scope" down the matcher. The following families
exist: `javascript` for any type of javascript event, `native` for any type of
native event. Any other platform is called `other`.

```discover {tabTitle:Fingerprinting Config}
family:native !stack.module:"myproject::*" -> not-from-my-project
```

### `app`

This matcher checks if the frame is in app or not. This is particularly useful
when combined with another matcher. Possible values are `yes` and `no`:

```discover {tabTitle:Fingerprinting Config}
app:yes stack.function:"assert" -> assert
```

## Combining Matchers

When multiple matchers are combined, they all need to match. Matchers that
operate on frames must all apply to the same frame otherwise they are not
considered to match. For instance, if you match on both function name and module
name then a match only exists if a frame matches both the function
name and the module name. It's not enough for a frame to match only with the function name, even if another frame would match the module name by itself.
matching function name only even if there is another frame that would match
the module name by itself.

```discover {tabTitle:Fingerprinting Config}
# this matches if a frame exists with a specific function and module name
# and also a specific error type is thrown
error.type:ConnectionError stack.function:"connect" stack.module:"bot" -> bot-error
```

## Variables

On the right hand side of the fingerprint constant values as well as variables
can be used. Variables are substituded automatically. Variables have the same
name as matchers but they might be filled in differently.

Variables are enclosed in double braces (`{{ variable_name }}`).

<DefinitionList>

### `{{ default }}`

This fills in the default fingerprint that would be produced by the normal
grouping operation. This is useful if you want to subdivide an already
existing group by something else:

```discover {tabTitle:Fingerprinting Config}
stack.function:"query_database" -> {{ default }}, {{ transaction }}
```

### `{{ transaction }}`

This fills in the name of the transaction into the fingerprint. This will
force the creation of a group per transaction:

```discover {tabTitle:Fingerprinting Config}
error.type:"ApiError" -> api-error, {{ transaction }}
```

### `{{ error.type }}`

alias: `{{ type }}`

This fills in the name of the error that ocurred. When chained exceptions are
used this will be the most recently thrown error. This will force the
creation of a group per transaction:

```discover {tabTitle:Fingerprinting Config}
stack.function:"evaluate_script" -> script-evaluation, {{ error.type }}
```

### `{{ stack.function }}`

alias: `{{ function }}`

This fills in the function name of the "crashing frame". That is the top most
frame that was considered to be in the application code.

```discover {tabTitle:Fingerprinting Config}
error.type:"ScriptError" -> script-evaluation, {{ stack.function }}
```

### `{{ stack.module }}`

alias: `{{ module }}`

This fills in the module name of the "crashing frame". That is the top most
frame that was considered to be in the application code.

```discover {tabTitle:Fingerprinting Config}
error.type:"ScriptError" -> script-evaluation, {{ stack.module }}
```

### `{{ stack.package }}`

alias: `{{ package }}`

This fills in the package name (object file) of the "crashing frame". That is
the top most frame that was considered to be in the application code.

```discover {tabTitle:Fingerprinting Config}
stack.function:"assert" -> assertion, {{ stack.package }}
```

### `{{ logger }}`

This fills in the name of the logger that caused an event.

```discover {tabTitle:Fingerprinting Config}
message:"critical connection error*" -> connection-error, {{ logger }}
```

### `{{ level }}`

This fills in the name of the log level that was used to create an event.

```discover {tabTitle:Fingerprinting Config}
message:"connection error*" -> connection-error, {{ logger }}, {{ level }}
```

### `{{ tags.tag_name }}`

This fills in the value of a tag into the fingerprint, which can, for instance,
be used to split events by server name or something similar.

```discover {tabTitle:Fingerprinting Config}
message:"connection error*" -> connection-error, {{ tags.server_name }}
```
