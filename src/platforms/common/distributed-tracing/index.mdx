## What is distributed tracing?

Applications can consist of multiple components, which are also called services. A web application for example can consist of a frontend, a backend and a microservice. A mobile app can alike constist of the mobile app running on the device and a backend and a microserivce.

When a user triggeres an action in the frontend or the app it will call the backend which on its part calls the microservice.
So the users action leaves a trace through three services.

Adding a unique trace ID to the users actions and passing it on from the frontend/app to the backend and further on to the microservice is called distributed tracing.

This way all the information that is collect on the frontend, the backend and the microservice is associated with one unique trace. Which makes it possible to relate information that was collected on the frontend with information collected in the backend or microservice

You could for example see what UI element was clicked on the frontend that lead to an error in the microservice. This gives you the complete picture of what was happing in your application as a whole, not just what was happening in one service.

## Configure

Es gibt zwei header

- `sentry-trace`
- `baggage`

Je nach User Setup in Firewalls / Proxies freischalten.

jetzt neu: auch ohne performance!

### Supported frameworks

In the following frameworks distributed tracing works out of the box:

- [Django](/platforms/python/guides/django/distributed-tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/)
- [FastAPI](/platforms/python/guides/fastapi/distributed-tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/)
- [Flask](/platforms/python/guides/flask/distributed-tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/)
- [Bottle](/platforms/python/guides/bottle/distributed-tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/)
- [Falcon](/platforms/python/guides/falcon/distributed-tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/)
- [Pyramid](/platforms/python/guides/pyramid/distributed-tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/)
- [Quart](/platforms/python/guides/quart/distributed-tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/)
- [Starlette](/platforms/python/guides/starlette/distributed-tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/)
- [Starlite](/platforms/python/guides/starlite/distributed-tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/)
- [Tornado](/platforms/python/guides/tornado/distributed-tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/)

<!--
TODO: Check these if there is really auto instrumentation:
- AWS Lambda
- GCP
- Trytond
- Celery
- rq
 -->

If you have a vanilla Python project or use a (yet) unsupported framework you need to implement <PlatformLink to="/distributed-tracing/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation/">Custom Instrumentation</PlatformLink>.
