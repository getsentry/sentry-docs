## What Is Distributed Tracing?

Applications can consist of multiple components, which are also called services. A web application for example can consist of a frontend, a backend and a microservice. A mobile app can alike constists of the mobile app running on the device and a backend and a microserivce.

When a user triggeres an action in the frontend/app it will call the backend which on its part calls the microservice.
So the users action leaves a trace through three services.

Adding a unique trace ID to the users actions and passing it on from the frontend/app to the backend and further on to the microservice is called distributed tracing.

This way all the information that is collected on the frontend, the backend and the microservice is correlated via the unique trace ID.

You could for example see what UI element was clicked on the frontend that lead to an error in the microservice. This gives you the complete picture of what was happing in your application as a whole, not just what was happening in one service.

## How Does Distributed Tracing Work in Sentry?

Sentry SDKs inject tracing information into outgoing requests and extract tracing information from incoming requests.

![Trace propagation in Sentry SDK](distributed-tracing-trace-propagation.png)

There are two headers that are used to propagate tracing information:

- `sentry-trace`
- `baggage`

Make sure that those headers aren't blocked or stripped by your proxy servers or firewalls to ensure distributed tracing works correctly.
