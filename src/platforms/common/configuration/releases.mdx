A release is a version of your code that is deployed to an environment. When you give Sentry information about your releases, you can:

- Determine issues and regressions introduced in a new release
- Predict which commit caused an issue and who is likely responsible
- Resolve issues by including the issue number in your commit message
- Receive email notifications when your code gets deployed

Additionally, releases are used for applying [source maps](/platforms/javascript/sourcemaps/) to minified JavaScript to view original, untransformed source code.

### Configure Your SDK {#configure-sdk}

Include a release ID (often called a "version") when you configure your client SDK. This ID is commonly a git SHA or a custom version number.

The release name cannot contain newlines, spaces, or "\\\", be ".", "..", or exceed 200 characters.

<Note><markdown>

Releases are global per organization; prefix them with something project-specific for easy differentiation.

How you make the version available to your code is up to you. For example, you could use an environment variable that is set during the build process.

This tags each event with the release value. We recommend that you tell Sentry about a new release before deploying it, as this will unlock a few more features as discussed in our documentation about . But if you donâ€™t, Sentry will automatically create a release entity in the system the first time it sees an event with that release ID.

After configuring your SDK, you can install a repository integration or manually supply Sentry with your own commit metadata. Read our documentation about [Releases](/product/releases/) for further information about integrations, associating commits, and telling Sentry when deploying releases.
