SDKs are configurable using a variety of options. The options are largely standardized among SDKs, but there are some differences to better accommodate platform peculiarities. Options are set when the SDK is first
initialized.

<PlatformContent includePath="configuration/config-intro" />

## Common Options

The list of common options across SDKs. These work more or less the same in all SDKs, but some subtle differences will exist to better support the platform. Options that can be read from an environment variable (`SENTRY_DSN`, `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT`, `SENTRY_RELEASE`) are read automatically.

<ConfigKey name="dsn">

The _DSN_ tells the SDK where to send the events. If this value is not provided, the SDK will try to read it from the `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable. If that variable also does not exist, the SDK will just not send any events.

In runtimes without a process environment (such as the browser) that fallback does not apply.

Learn more about [DSN utilization](/product/sentry-basics/dsn-explainer/#dsn-utilization).

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="stack-trace-mode" supported={["dotnet"]}>

- Original - Default .NET stack trace format.
- Enhanced - Include `async`, return type, arguments, and more.

Before version 3.0.0 of the Sentry SDK for .NET, there was no special treatment for the stack trace. Sentry reported what .NET made available at runtime.
This behavior now called `StackTraceMode.Original`. With the introduction of 3.0, a new default mode is `Enhanced`.

<Note>

Changing this value will affect issue grouping. Since the frame significantly changes shape.

</Note>

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="is-global-mode-enabled" supported={["dotnet"]}>

Specifies whether to use global scope management mode. Should be `true` for client applications and `false` for server applications.

Example scenarios where it should be explicitly set to true:

- Universal Windows platform (UWP) applications
- WinForms applications
- Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) applications
- Single user console applications

Defaults to `false`, unless in Blazor WASM, MAUI, Unity, or Xamarin where the default is `true`.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="database-path" supported={["native"]}>

Allows you to specify a path to the local event- and crash-database of the Native SDK. This path will default to `.sentry-native` relative to the current working directory (`CWD`). While this is a convenient setting for development, we strongly urge you to provide an explicit database path for our production deployments. In many deployment scenarios, the path relative to the `CWD` will not be writable. For this reason, you should store the database in your application's user-specific data/cache directory (e.g., under `%AppData%\Local` on Windows, `~/Library/Application Support` on macOS, or `XDG_CACHE_HOME` on Linux).

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="debug" notSupported={["php"]}>

Turns debug mode on or off. If debug is enabled SDK will attempt to print out useful debugging information if something goes wrong with sending the event. The default is always `false`. It's generally not recommended to turn it on in production, though turning `debug` mode on will not cause any safety concerns.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="diagnostic-level" supported={["dotnet", "java", "android", "dart", "flutter", "apple"]}>

Enabling `debug` mode makes the SDK generate as much diagnostic data as possible. However, if you'd prefer to lower the verbosity of the Sentry SDK diagnostics logs, configure this option to set the appropriate level:

- `debug`: **default** The most verbose mode
- `info`: Informational messages
- `warning`: Warning that something might not be right
- `error`: Only SDK internal errors are printed
- `fatal`: Only critical errors are printed

</ConfigKey>

<PlatformSection supported={["dotnet"]}>

For app models that don't have a console to print to, you can <PlatformLink to="/configuration/diagnostic-logger/">customize the SDK's diagnostic logger</PlatformLink> to write to a file or to Visual Studio's debug window.

</PlatformSection>

<ConfigKey name="releaseName" supported={["apple"]}>

Sets the release. Some SDKs will try to automatically configure a release out of the box but it's a better idea to manually set it to guarantee that the release is in sync with your deploy integrations or source map uploads. Release names are strings, but some formats are detected by Sentry and might be rendered differently. Learn more about how to send release data so Sentry can tell you about regressions between releases and identify the potential source in [the releases documentation](/product/releases/) or the <SandboxLink scenario="releases">sandbox</SandboxLink>.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="dist" supported={["apple", "java", "android", "dart", "flutter", "dotnet", "react-native"]}>

Sets the distribution of the application. Distributions are used to disambiguate build or deployment variants of the same release of an application. For example, the dist can be the build number of an Xcode build or the version code of an Android build.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="release" notSupported={["apple"]}>

Sets the release. Some SDKs will try to automatically configure a release out of the box but it's a better idea to manually set it to guarantee that the release is in sync with your deploy integrations or source map uploads. Release names are strings, but some formats are detected by Sentry and might be rendered differently. Learn more about how to send release data so Sentry can tell you about regressions between releases and identify the potential source in [the releases documentation](/product/releases/) or the <SandboxLink scenario="releases">sandbox</SandboxLink>.

<PlatformSection notSupported={["unity", "javascript.electron"]}>

By default the SDK will try to read this value from the `SENTRY_RELEASE` environment variable (in the browser SDK, this will be read off of the `window.SENTRY_RELEASE` if available).

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["javascript.electron"]}>

By default the SDK will read properties from the Electron `app` module to create the release in the format `appName@version`.

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["unity"]}>

By default the SDK will read from `Application.productName` and `Application.version` to create the release in the format `$"{Application.productName}@{Application.version}".`

</PlatformSection>

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="environment">

<PlatformSection notSupported={["native", "javascript.electron", "unity", "dotnet", "python"]}>

Sets the environment. This string is freeform and not set by default. A release can be associated with more than one environment to separate them in the UI (think `staging` vs `prod` or similar).

By default the SDK will try to read this value from the `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable (except for the browser SDK where this is not applicable).

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["native"]}>

Sets the environment. This string is freeform and set by default. A release can be associated with more than one environment to separate them in the UI (think `staging` vs `prod` or similar).

By default the SDK will try to read this value from the `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable. Otherwise, the default environment is `production`.

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["javascript.electron"]}>

Sets the environment. Defaults to `development` or `production` depending on whether the application is packaged.

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["unity"]}>

Sets the environment. This string is freeform and set by default. A release can be associated with more than one environment to separate them in the UI (think `staging` vs `prod` or similar).

By default, the SDK reports `editor` when running inside the Unity Editor. Otherwise, the default environment is `production`.

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["dotnet"]} notSupported={["unity"]}>

Sets the environment. This string is freeform and set by default. A release can be associated with more than one environment to separate them in the UI (think `staging` vs `prod` or similar).

By default, the SDK reports `debug` when the debugger is attached. Otherwise, the default environment is `production`.

Additionally, if you are running with the ASP.NET Core integration, you will also see the environment named as `staging`, if running in staging, or `development`, if running in development mode.

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["python"]}>

Sets the environment. This string is freeform and set to `production` by default. A release can be associated with more than one environment to separate them in the UI (think `staging` vs `production` or similar).

By default the SDK will try to read this value from the `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable.

</PlatformSection>

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="tunnel" supported={["javascript", "node"]}>

Sets the URL that will be used to transport captured events, instead of using the DSN. This can be used to work around ad-blockers or to have more granular
control over events sent to Sentry. This option **requires the implementation** of a custom server endpoint. Learn more and find examples in [Dealing with Ad-Blockers](/platforms/javascript/troubleshooting/#dealing-with-ad-blockers).

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="error-types" supported={["php"]}>

Sets which errors are reported. It takes the same values as PHP's [`error_reporting`](https://www.php.net/manual/errorfunc.configuration.php#ini.error-reporting) configuration parameter.

By default all types of errors are be reported (equivalent to `E_ALL`).

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="sample-rate">

Configures the sample rate for error events, in the range of `0.0` to `1.0`. The default is `1.0` which means that 100% of error events are sent. If set to `0.1` only 10% of error events will be sent. Events are picked randomly.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="max-breadcrumbs">

This variable controls the total amount of breadcrumbs that should be captured. This defaults to `100`, but you can set this to any number. However, you should be aware that Sentry has a [maximum payload size](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/envelopes/#size-limits) and any events exceeding that payload size will be dropped.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="max-cache-items" supported={[ "android", "apple", "flutter", "java", "dotnet" ]} >

The maximum number of [envelopes](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/envelopes/) to keep in cache. The SDKs use envelopes to send data, such as events, attachments, user feedback, and sessions to sentry.io. An envelope can contain multiple items, such as an event with a session and two attachments. Depending on the usage of the SDK, the size of an envelope can differ. If the number of envelopes in the local cache exceeds `max-cache-items`, the SDK deletes the oldest envelope and migrates the sessions to the next envelope to maintain the integrity of your release health stats. The default is `30`.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="attach-stacktrace">

When enabled, stack traces are automatically attached to all messages logged. Stack traces are always attached to exceptions; however, when this option is set, stack traces are also sent with messages. This option, for instance, means that stack traces appear next to all log messages.

<PlatformSection supported={["android", "apple", "java"]}>

This option is `on` by default.

</PlatformSection>
<PlatformSection notSupported={["android", "apple", "java", "dotnet"]}>

This option is `off` by default.

</PlatformSection>

Grouping in Sentry is different for events with stack traces and without. As a result, you will get new groups as you enable or disable this flag for certain events.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="send-default-pii" supported={["apple", "dotnet", "react-native", "python", "java", "php", "rust", "dart", "react-native"]}>

If this flag is enabled, certain personally identifiable information (PII) is added by active integrations. By default, no such data is sent.

<Note>

If you are using Sentry in your mobile app, read our [frequently asked questions about mobile data privacy](/product/security/mobile-privacy/) to assist with Apple App Store and Google Play app privacy details.

</Note>

This option is `off` by default.

If you enable this option, be sure to manually remove what you don't want to send using our features for managing [_Sensitive Data_](../../data-management/sensitive-data/).

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="event-scrubber" supported={["python"]}>

If <PlatformIdentifier name="send-default-pii" /> is `off`, scrubs the event payload for sensitive information from a `denylist`. See how to [configure the scrubber here](../../data-management/sensitive-data/#event-scrubber).

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="server-name" supported={["python", "node", "ruby", "php", "java", "dart", "dotnet"]} notSupported={["android"]}>

This option can be used to supply a "server name." When provided, the name of the server is sent along and persisted in the event. For many integrations, the server name actually corresponds to the device hostname, even in situations where the machine is not actually a server.

<PlatformSection notSupported={["dotnet"]}>

Most SDKs will attempt to auto-discover this value.

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["dotnet"]}>

For ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core applications, the value will default to the server's name. For other application types, the value will default to the computer's name only when the `SendDefaultPii` is set to `true`, because the computer's name can be considered personally identifiable information (PII) in the case of a desktop or mobile application.

</PlatformSection>

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="ignore-errors" supported={["javascript", "node"]} notSupported={[]}>

A list of strings or regex patterns that match error messages that shouldn't be sent to Sentry. Messages that match these strings or regular expressions will be filtered out before they're sent to Sentry. When using strings, partial matches will be filtered out, so if you need to filter by exact match, use regex patterns instead. By default, all errors are sent.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="ignore-transactions" supported={["javascript", "node"]} notSupported={[]}>

A list of strings or regex patterns that match transaction names that shouldn't be sent to Sentry. Transactions that match these strings or regular expressions will be filtered out before they're sent to Sentry. When using strings, partial matches will be filtered out, so if you need to filter by exact match, use regex patterns instead. By default, all transactions are sent.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="deny-urls" supported={["javascript"]} notSupported={["node"]}>

A list of strings or regex patterns that match error URLs that should not be sent to Sentry. Errors whose entire file URL contains (string) or matches (regex) at least one entry in the list will not be sent. As a result, if you add `'foo.com'` to the list, it will also match on `https://bar.com/myfile/foo.com`. By default, all errors are sent.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="allow-urls" supported={["javascript"]} notSupported={["node"]}>

A list of strings or regex patterns that match error URLs which should exclusively be sent to Sentry. If you use this option, only errors whose entire file URL contains (string) or matches (regex) at least one entry in the list will be sent. As a result, if you add `'foo.com'` to it, it will also match on `https://bar.com/myfile/foo.com`. By default, all errors are sent.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="auto-session-tracking" supported={["javascript", "flutter", "android", "apple"]} notSupported={["javascript.electron"]}>

When set to `true`, the SDK will send session events to Sentry. This is supported in all browser SDKs, emitting one session per pageload and page navigation to Sentry. In mobile SDKs, when the app goes to the background for longer than 30 seconds, sessions are ended.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="auto-session-tracking" supported={["javascript.electron"]} >

When not set to `false`, the SDK tracks sessions linked to the lifetime of the Electron main process.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="consider-in-app-frames-by-default" supported={["dart"]}>

Configures whether stack trace frames are considered as in app frames by default.
You can use this to essentially make `inAppIncludes` or `inAppExcludes` an allow or deny list.
This value is used only if Sentry can not find the origin of the frame.

- If `considerInAppFramesByDefault` is set to `true`, you only need to maintain `inAppExcludes`.
- Conversely, if `considerInAppFramesByDefault` is set to `false`, you only need to maintain `inAppIncludes`.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="in-app-include" supported={["apple", "dotnet", "python", "rust", "csharp", "php", "java", "dart"]}>

A list of string prefixes of module names that belong to the app. This option takes precedence over `in-app-exclude`.

Sentry differentiates stack frames that are directly related to your application ("in application") from stack frames that come from other packages such as the standard library, frameworks, or other dependencies. The application package is automatically marked as `inApp`. The difference is visible in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io), where only the "in application" frames are displayed by default.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="in-app-exclude" supported={["apple", "dotnet", "python", "rust", "csharp", "php", "java", "dart"]}>

A list of string prefixes of module names that do not belong to the app, but rather to third-party packages. Modules considered not part of the app will be hidden from stack traces by default.

This option can be overridden using <PlatformIdentifier name="in-app-include" />.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="ignored-exceptions-for-type" supported={["java", "android"]}>

A list of exception types that will be filtered out before sending to Sentry.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="request-bodies" supported={["python"]}>

This parameter controls if integrations should capture HTTP request bodies. It can be set to one of the following values:

- `never`: request bodies are never sent
- `small`: only small request bodies will be captured where the cutoff for small depends on the SDK (typically 4KB)
- `medium`: medium and small requests will be captured (typically 10KB)
- `always`: the SDK will always capture the request body for as long as Sentry can make sense of it

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="max-request-body-size" supported={["php", "dotnet.aspnet", "dotnet.aspnetcore", "java"]}>

This parameter controls whether integrations should capture HTTP request bodies. It can be set to one of the following values:

- `never`: Request bodies are never sent.
- `small`: Only small request bodies will be captured. The cutoff for small depends on the SDK (typically 4KB).
- `medium`: Medium and small requests will be captured (typically 10KB).
- `always`: The SDK will always capture the request body as long as Sentry can make sense of it.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="max-value-length" supported={["php"]}>

The number of characters after which the values containing text in the event payload will be truncated (defaults to `1024`).

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="with-locals" supported={["python"]}>

When enabled, local variables are sent along with stackframes. This can have a performance and PII impact. Enabled by default on platforms where this is available.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="ca-certs" supported={["python", "node"]}>

A path to an alternative CA bundle file in PEM-format.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="context-lines" supported={["php"]}>

The number of context lines for each frame in the stacktrace when loading a file.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="frame-context-lines" supported={["node"]}>

The number of context lines for each frame when loading a file.

#### Deprecated

`frameContextLines` has moved to the <PlatformLink to="/configuration/integrations/default-integrations/#contextlines">`ContextLines` integration</PlatformLink>.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="initial-scope" supported={["javascript","node"]} notSupported={["react-native"]}>

Data to be set to the initial scope. Initial scope can be defined either as an object or a callback function, as shown below.

Object:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
  debug: true,
  initialScope: {
    tags: {'my-tag': 'my value'},
    user: {id: 42, email: 'john.doe@example.com'},
  },
});
```

Callback function:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
  debug: true,
  initialScope: scope => {
    scope.setTags({a: 'b'});
    return scope;
  },
});
```

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="max-value-length" supported={["javascript", "node"]}>

Maximum number of characters a single value can have before it will be truncated (defaults to `250`).

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="normalize-depth" supported={["javascript", "node"]}>

Sentry SDKs normalize any contextual data to a given depth. Any data beyond this depth will be trimmed and marked using its type instead (`[Object]` or `[Array]`), without walking the tree any further. By default, walking is performed three levels deep.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="normalize-max-breadth" supported={["javascript", "node"]} notSupported={["electron"]}>

_(New in version 6.19.1)_

This is the maximum number of properties or entries that will be included in any given object or array when the SDK is normalizing contextual data. Any data beyond this depth will be dropped. (defaults to 1000)

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="attach-screenshot" supported={["android", "apple.ios", "unity", "dotnet.xamarin", "flutter"]}>

Takes a screenshot of the application when an error happens and includes it as an attachment.
Learn more about enriching events with screenshots in our <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/screenshots/">Screenshots documentation</PlatformLink>.

<PlatformSection supported={["android"]}>

_(New in version 6.0.0)_

</PlatformSection>

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="screenshot-quality" supported={["unity", "dotnet.xamarin", "flutter"]}>

The quality of the attached screenshot.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="attach-viewhierarchy" supported={["apple.ios", "flutter", "android", "react-native"]}>

Renders a JSON represention of the entire view hierarchy of the application when an error happens and includes it as an attachment.
Learn more about enriching events with the view hierarchy in our <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/viewhierarchy/">View Hierarchy documentation</PlatformLink>.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="idle-timeout" supported={["android", "flutter"]}>

The idle time, measured in ms, to wait until a transaction will be automatically finished. The transaction will use the end timestamp of the last finished span as the endtime for the transaction.

The default is `3000`.

<PlatformSection supported={["android"]}>

_(New in version 6.0.0)_

<Note>

This only affects [user interaction transactions](/platforms/android/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#user-interaction-instrumentation).

</Note>

</PlatformSection>

</ConfigKey>

<PlatformSection supported={["javascript.electron"]}>

<ConfigKey name="ipcMode" />

Inter-process communication mode to receive event and scope updates from renderer processes.

Available options are:

- `IPCMode.Classic` - Configures Electron IPC modules
- `IPCMode.Protocol` - Configures a custom protocol and `fetch`
- `IPCMode.Both` (default) - Configures both modes for maximum compatibility

<ConfigKey name="getSessions" />

A function that returns an array of Electron `session` objects. These sessions are used to configure communication between the Electron main and renderer processes.

Defaults to `() => [session.defaultSession]`

<ConfigKey name="getRendererName" />

Callback function that allows custom naming of renderer processes.

`(contents: WebContents) => string | undefined`

If the callback is not set, or it returns `undefined`, the default naming scheme is used.

</PlatformSection>

<ConfigKey name="enabled" supported={["javascript", "node"]}>

Specifies whether this SDK should send events to Sentry. Defaults to `true`. Setting this to `enabled: false` doesn't prevent all overhead from Sentry instrumentation. To disable Sentry completely, depending on environment, call `Sentry.init` conditionally.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="send-client-reports" supported={["java", "javascript", "dotnet", "python", "dart", "apple"]} notSupported={["react-native"]}>

Set this boolean to `false` to disable sending of client reports. Client reports are a protocol feature that let clients send status reports about themselves to Sentry. They are currently mainly used to emit outcomes for events that were never sent.

<PlatformSection supported={["java"]}>

_(New in version 6.0.0)_

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["apple"]}>

_(New in version 7.13.0)_

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["dart"]}>

_(New in version 6.6.0)_

</PlatformSection>

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="capture-failed-requests" supported={["apple"]}>

Once enabled, this feature automatically captures HTTP client errors, like bad response codes, as error events and reports them to Sentry.

<PlatformSection supported={["apple"]}>

_(New in version 7.30.0)_

</PlatformSection>

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="include-local-variables" supported={["node"]}>

Set this boolean to `true` to add stack local variables to stack traces.

<Alert level="warning">

Due to an [open Node.js issue](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/38439), we
are currently unable to capture local variables for unhandled errors when using
JavaScript modules (ESM).

See the <PlatformLink to="/configuration/integrations/default-integrations/#localvariables">integration
options</PlatformLink> for a workaround.

</Alert>

</ConfigKey>

<PlatformSection supported={["javascript", "python", "node", "dart", "java", "apple"]}>

## Integration Configuration

For many platform SDKs integrations can be configured alongside it. On some platforms that happen as part of the `init()` call, in some others, different patterns apply.

<ConfigKey name="integrations" />

In some SDKs, the integrations are configured through this parameter on library initialization. For more information, please see our documentation for a specific integration.

<ConfigKey name="default-integrations" notSupported={['java', 'dart']} />

This can be used to disable integrations that are added by default. When set to `false`, no default integrations are added.

</PlatformSection>

## Hooks

These options can be used to hook the SDK in various ways to customize the reporting of events.

<PlatformSection supported={["unity"]}>

The callbacks you set as hooks will be called on the thread where the event happened. So you can only use
thread-safe APIs and only use Unity-specific APIs after you've checked that you're on the UI thread.

</PlatformSection>

<ConfigKey name="before-send">

This function is called with an SDK-specific message or error event object, and can return a modified event object, or `null` to skip reporting the event. This can be used, for instance, for manual PII stripping before sending.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="before-send-transaction" supported={["javascript", "node", "php", "go", "python", "java"]}>

This function is called with an SDK-specific transaction event object, and can return a modified transaction event object, or `null` to skip reporting the event. One way this might be used is for manual PII stripping before sending.

<PlatformSection supported={["javascript", "node"]}>

_(New in version 7.18.0)_

</PlatformSection>

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="on-crash" supported={["native"]}>

This function is called with a backend-specific event object, and can return a modified event object or nothing to skip reporting the event. In contrast to `before_send`, it is only called when a crash occured. You can find detailed information concerning its usage in [Filtering](/platforms/native/configuration/filtering/#using-on_crash).

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="before-breadcrumb" notSupported={["native"]}>

This function is called with an SDK-specific breadcrumb object before the breadcrumb is added to the scope. When nothing is returned from the function, the breadcrumb is dropped. To pass the breadcrumb through, return the first argument, which contains the breadcrumb object.
The callback typically gets a second argument (called a "hint") which contains the original object from which the breadcrumb was created to further customize what the breadcrumb should look like.

</ConfigKey>

<PlatformSection supported={["javascript", "java", "python", "node", "php", "dotnet", "dart"]}>

## Transport Options

Transports are used to send events to Sentry. Transports can be customized to some degree to better support highly specific deployments.

<ConfigKey name="transport" supported={["javascript", "php", "python", "java", "dotnet", "dart", "rust"]}>

Switches out the transport used to send events. How this works depends on the SDK. It can, for instance, be used to capture events for unit-testing or to send it through some more complex setup that requires proxy authentication.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="transport-options" supported={["javascript", "node"]}>

Options used to configure the transport. This is an object with the following possible optional keys:

<PlatformSection supported={["node"]}>

- `headers`: An object containing headers to be sent with every request.
- `proxy`: A proxy used for outbound requests. Can be http or https.
- `caCerts`: A path or list of paths to a CA certificate, or a buffer of CA certificates.
- `httpModule`: A custom HTTP module to use for requests. Defaults to the the native `http` and `https` modules.
- `keepAlive`: Determines whether to keep the socket alive between requests. Defaults to `false`.

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["javascript"]} notSupported={["node"]}>

- `headers`: An object containing headers to be sent with every request. Used by the SDK's fetch and XHR transports.
- `fetchOptions`: An object containing options to be passed to the `fetch` call. Used by the SDK's fetch transport.

</PlatformSection>

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="proxy" supported={['native']}>
  Configures an HTTP proxy for outgoing requests to the backend, (HTTPS requests tunneled
  through that proxy). The Native SDK doesn't pick up the `http_proxy` environment
  variable. You can find more details on the [transport
  page](/platforms/native/configuration/transports/#using-an-http-proxy).
</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="http-proxy" supported={["php", "python", "java", "dotnet", "rust"]}>

When set, a proxy can be configured that should be used for outbound requests. This is also used for HTTPS requests unless a separate `https-proxy` is configured. However, not all SDKs support a separate HTTPS proxy. SDKs will attempt to default to the system-wide configured proxy, if possible. For instance, on Unix systems, the `http_proxy` environment variable will be picked up.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="https-proxy" supported={["python", "rust"]}>

Configures a separate proxy for outgoing HTTPS requests. This value might not be supported by all SDKs. When not supported the `http-proxy` value is also used for HTTPS requests at all times.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="proxy-headers" supported={["python"]}>

A dict containing additional proxy headers (usually for authentication) to be forwarded to `urllib3`'s [`ProxyManager`](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/1.24.3/reference/index.html#urllib3.poolmanager.ProxyManager).

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="cache-directory-path" supported={["dotnet", "android", "unity"]}>

Specifies a local directory used for caching payloads. When this option is enabled (that is, when the directory is set), the Sentry SDK will persist envelopes locally before sending to Sentry. This configuration option is particularly useful if you expect your application to run in environments where internet connectivity is limited.

</ConfigKey>

<PlatformSection supported={["android"]}>

Default: set to `android.content.Context.getCacheDir()/sentry`.

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["dotnet"]} notSupported={["dotnet.xamarin", "dotnet.maui", "unity"]}>

Default: not set (caching is disabled).

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["unity"]}>

The default value is `Application.persistentDataPath`. You can disable offline caching by setting it to `null`.

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["dotnet.xamarin"]}>

The default value is `Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.LocalApplicationData)`.

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["dotnet.maui"]}>

The default value is `Path.Combine(FileSystem.CacheDirectory, "sentry")`. See the [Microsoft docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/maui/platform-integration/storage/file-system-helpers#platform-differences) for how `FileSystem.CacheDirectory` differs on each supported platform.

</PlatformSection>

<ConfigKey name="init-cache-flush-timeout" supported={["dotnet"]}>

When caching is enabled (that is, <PlatformIdentifier name="cache-directory-path" /> is set), this option controls the timeout that limits how long the SDK will attempt to flush existing cache during initialization. Note that flushing the cache involves sending the payload to Sentry in a blocking operation. Setting this option to zero means that Sentry will **not** attempt to flush the cache during initialization, but instead will do so when the next payload is queued up.

The default is `1` (one) second.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="shutdown-timeout" supported={["python", "node", "java", "dotnet", "rust", "react-native", "javascript.capacitor"]}>

Controls how many seconds to wait before shutting down. Sentry SDKs send events from a background queue. This queue is given a certain amount to drain pending events. The default is SDK specific but typically around two seconds. Setting this value too low may cause problems for sending events from command line applications. Setting the value too high will cause the application to block for a long time for users experiencing network connectivity problems.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="send-attempts" supported={["php"]}>

_Deprecated._ Controls how many times the SDK will attempt to resend an event to Sentry. The default is `0`.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="http-connect-timeout" supported={["php"]}>

The maximum number of seconds to wait while trying to connect to a server. The default is `2`.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="http-timeout" supported={["php"]}>

The maximum execution time, in seconds, for the request+response as a whole. The value should also include the time for the connect phase, so it should be greater than the value set for the `http_connect_timeout` option. The default is `5`.

</ConfigKey>

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["node", "javascript", "python", "php", "dotnet", "java", "ruby", "go", "react-native", "android", "dotnet", "rust", "native", "apple"]}>

## Tracing Options

<ConfigKey name="traces-sample-rate" supported={["node", "javascript", "python", "php", "dotnet", "java", "ruby", "go", "react-native", "android", "dotnet", "rust", "native", "dart"]}>

A number between 0 and 1, controlling the percentage chance a given transaction will be sent to Sentry. (0 represents 0% while 1 represents 100%.) Applies equally to all transactions created in the app. Either this or <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> must be defined to enable tracing.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="traces-sampler" supported={["node", "javascript", "python", "php", "dotnet", "java", "ruby", "go", "react-native", "android", "dotnet", "dart"]} notSupported={["native"]}>

A function responsible for determining the percentage chance a given transaction will be sent to Sentry. It will automatically be passed information about the transaction and the context in which it's being created, and must return a number between `0` (0% chance of being sent) and `1` (100% chance of being sent). Can also be used for filtering transactions, by returning 0 for those that are unwanted. Either this or <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> must be defined to enable tracing.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="tracing-origins" supported={["java"]}>

An optional property that configures which downstream services receive the `sentry-trace` header attached to HTTP requests. It contains a list of URLs or regex against which URLs are matched. If not set, the `sentry-trace` header is attached to every request executed from an instrumented client.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="trace-propagation-targets" supported={["node", "apple", "dart", "flutter", "java", "python"]}>

An optional property that controls which downstream services receive tracing data, in the form of a `sentry-trace` and a `baggage` header attached to any outgoing HTTP requests.

The option may contain a list of strings or regex against which the URLs of outgoing requests are matched.
If one of the entries in the list matches the URL of an outgoing request, trace data will be attached to that request.
String entries do not have to be full matches, meaning the URL of a request is matched when it _contains_ a string provided through the option.

If <PlatformIdentifier name="trace-propagation-targets" /> is not provided, trace data is attached to every outgoing request from the instrumented client.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="functions-to-trace" supported={["python"]}>

An optional list of functions that should be set up for performance monitoring. For each function in the list, a span will be created when the function is executed.
Functions in the list are represented as strings containing the fully qualified name of the function.

This is a convenient option, making it possible to have one central place for configuring what functions to trace, instead of having manual instrumentation scattered all over your code base.

To learn more, see the [Custom Instrumentation](/platforms/python/performance/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation/#define-span-creation-in-a-central-place) documentation.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="trace-options-requests" supported={["java"]}>

<PlatformSection supported={["java"]}>

Set this boolean to `false` to disable tracing for `OPTIONS` requests. This options default value will likely be changed in the next major version, meaning you will have to set it to `true` if you want to keep tracing `OPTIONS` requests.

</PlatformSection>

</ConfigKey>

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["react-native", "javascript.cordova", "javascript.capacitor", "flutter"]}>

## Experimental Features

<ConfigKey name="experimental" supported={[]}>

An optional property that configures which features are in experimental mode. This property is either an `Object Type` with properties or a key/value `TypedDict`, depending the language. Experimental features are still in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.

</ConfigKey>
