Adding Sentry to your app gives you a great deal of very valuable information about errors and performance you wouldn't otherwise get. And lots of information is good -- as long as it's the right information, at a reasonable volume.

The Sentry SDKs have several configuration options to help you control this, allowing you to both filter out events you don't want and to take a representative sample of those you do.

**Note:**: The Sentry UI also offers methods to filter events, by using [Inbound Filters](/product/error-monitoring/filtering/). We recommend filtering at the client level though, because it removes the overhead of sending events you don't actually want.

## Filtering Error Events

Configure your SDK to filter error events by using the `beforeSend` callback method and configuring, enabling, or disabling integrations.

### Using `beforeSend`

All Sentry SDKs support the `beforeSend` callback method. `beforeSend` is called immediately before the event is sent to the server, so it’s the final place where you can edit its data. It receives the event object as a parameter, so you can use that to modify the event’s data or drop it completely (by returning `null`) based on custom logic and the data available on the event.

<PlatformContent includePath="configuration/before-send" />

Note also that breadcrumbs can be filtered, as discussed in [our Breadcrumbs documentation](/product/error-monitoring/breadcrumbs/).

#### Event Hints

The `before-send` callback is passed both the `event` and a second argument, `hint`, that holds one or more hints.

Typically a `hint` holds the original exception so that additional data can be extracted or grouping is affected. In this example, the fingerprint is forced to a common value if an exception of a certain type has been caught:

<PlatformContent includePath="configuration/before-send-hint" />

When the SDK creates an event or breadcrumb for transmission, that transmission is typically created from some sort of source object. For instance, an error event is typically created from a log record or exception instance. For better customization, SDKs send these objects to certain callbacks (`beforeSend`, `beforeBreadcrumb` or the event processor system in the SDK).

### Using Hints

Hints are available in two places:

1. `beforeSend` / `beforeBreadcrumb`
2. `eventProcessors`

Event and breadcrumb `hints` are objects containing various information used to put together an event or a breadcrumb. Typically `hints` hold the original exception so that additional data can be extracted or grouping can be affected.

For events, such as `event_id`, `originalException`, `syntheticException` (used internally to generate cleaner stack trace), and any other arbitrary `data` that you attach.

For breadcrumbs, the use of `hints` is implementation dependent. For XHR requests, the hint contains the xhr object itself; for user interactions the hint contains the DOM element and event name and so forth.

In this example, the fingerprint is forced to a common value if an exception of a certain type has been caught:

<PlatformContent includePath="configuration/before-send-fingerprint" />

#### Hints for Events

`originalException`

: The original exception that caused the Sentry SDK to create the event. This is useful for changing how the Sentry SDK groups events or to extract additional information.

`syntheticException`

: When a string or a non-error object is raised, Sentry creates a synthetic exception so you can get a basic stack trace. This exception is stored here for further data extraction.

#### Hints for Breadcrumbs

`event`

: For breadcrumbs created from browser events, the Sentry SDK often supplies the event to the breadcrumb as a hint. This, for instance, can be used to extract data from the target DOM element into a breadcrumb.

`level` / `input`

: For breadcrumbs created from console log interceptions. This holds the original console log level and the original input data to the log function.

`response` / `input`

: For breadcrumbs created from HTTP requests. This holds the response object (from the fetch API) and the input parameters to the fetch function.

`request` / `response` / `event`

: For breadcrumbs created from HTTP requests. This holds the request and response object (from the node HTTP API) as well as the node event (`response` or `error`).

`xhr`

: For breadcrumbs created from HTTP requests done via the legacy `XMLHttpRequest` API. This holds the original xhr object.

## Sampling Error Events

To send a representative sample of your errors to Sentry, set the <PlatformIdentifier name="sample-rate" /> option in your SDK configuration to a number between `0` (0% of errors sent) and `1` (100% of errors sent). This is a static rate, which will apply equally to all errors. For example, to sample 25% of your errors:

<PlatformContent includePath="configuration/sample-rate" />

**Note:** The error sample rate is not dynamic; changing it requires re-deployment. In addition, setting an SDK sample rate limits visibility into the source of events. Setting a rate limit for your project (which only drops events when volume is high) may better suit your needs.

## Filtering Transaction Events

To prevent certain transactions from being reported to Sentry, use the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> configuration option, which allows you to provide a function to evaluate the current transaction and drop it if it's not one you want. (It also allows you to sample different transactions at different rates.)

**Note:** The <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> and <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> config options are mutually exclusive. If you define a <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> to filter out certain transactions, you must also handle the case of non-filtered transactions by returning the rate at which you'd like them sampled.

In its simplest form, used just for filtering, it looks like this:

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/traces-sampler-as-filter" />

## Sampling Transaction Events

For Sentry's Performance Monitoring, we recommend sampling your data for two reasons. First, though capturing a single trace involves minimal overhead, capturing traces for every single page load, or every single API request, has the potential to add an undesirable amount of load to your system. Second, enabling sampling allows you to better manage the number of events sent to Sentry, so you can tailor it to your organization's needs.

When choosing a sampling rate, the goal is not to collect *too* much data, but to collect sufficient data so you can draw meaningful conclusions. If you’re not sure what rate to choose, start with a low value and gradually increase it as you learn more about your traffic patterns and volume, until you’ve found a rate that balances performance and volume concerns with data accuracy.


To set a sample rate for your transactions, provide a number between `0` (0% of transactions sent) and `1` (100% of transactions sent) to the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> configuration option. For example, including <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate: 0.2" /> in your SDK config will cause the SDK to only send 20% of possible transaction events.
