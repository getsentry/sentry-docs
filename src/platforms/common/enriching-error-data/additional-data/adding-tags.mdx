**Tags** are key/value string pairs that are both indexed and searchable. Tags power UI features such as filters and tag-distribution maps. Tags help you quickly access related events and view the tag distribution for a set of events. Common uses for tags include hostname, platform version, and user language.

Once you've started sending tagged data, you'll see it in the Sentry web UI: the filters within the sidebar on the Project page, summarized within an event, and on the tags page for an aggregated event.

Weâ€™ll automatically index all tags for an event, as well as the frequency and the last time the Sentry SDK has seen a value. We also keep track of the number of distinct tags and can assist you in determining hotspots for various issues.

To set a tag:

<PlatformContent includePath="set-tag" />

**Important:** Some tags are automatically set by Sentry. We strongly recommend against overwriting those tags, and instead using your own nomenclature for names.
