Data is sent with every event, and is either predefined or custom:

- **Predefined data** is data that Sentry recognizes. This data enhances your ability to understand and investigate the source and impact of the data when viewing it in sentry.io. For example, the concept of user helps sentry.io display the number of unique users affected by an event.

- **Custom data** is arbitrary structured or unstructured extra data you can attach to your event.

Regardless of whether the data sent to Sentry is predefined or custom, additional data can take two forms, tags and context:

- **Tags** are key/value string pairs that are both indexed and searchable. Tags power UI features such as filters and tag-distribution maps. Tags help you quickly access related events and view the tag distribution for a set of events. Common uses for tags include hostname, platform version, and user language.

- **Context** includes additional diagnostic information attached to an event. By default, contexts are not searchable, but for convenience Sentry turns information in some predefined contexts into tags, making them searchable.

## Automatic Instrumentation

Certain data is sent to Sentry automatically. This section explains the predefined data, some of which is simply the type of device or browser being used at the time of the event. Other predefined data you can modify, such as the `level` of the event. The final type of predefined data, `environment` and `release`, affect the UI experience or enable features within the product to help better identify issues in your application.

### Predefined Data

Sentry turns additional, predefined data or specific attributes on the data into _tags_, which you can use for a variety of purposes, such as searching in the web UI for the event or delving deeper into your application. For example, you can use tags such as `level` or `user.email` to surface particular errors. You can also enable Sentry to track [releases](/workflow/releases/), which unlocks features that help you delve more deeply into the differences between deployed releases.

If Sentry captures some predefined data but doesnâ€™t expose it as a tag, you can set a custom tag for it.

`request`, `device`, `OS`, `runtime`, `app`, `browser`, `GPU`, `logger`, and `monitor` are the most typical predefined data sent with an event. In addition, the following are sent, and can be modified for your team's use:

`level`

: Defines the severity of an event. The level can be set to one of five values, which are, in order of severity: `fatal`, `error`, `warning`, `info`, and `debug.error`. Learn how to set the level in [Set the Level](#set-the-level)

`user`

: Providing user information to Sentry helps you evaluate the number of users affecting an issue and evaluate the quality of the application. Learn how to capture user information in Capture the User

`fingerprint`

: Sentry uses one or more fingerprints to determine how to group errors into issues. Learn more about Sentry's approach to grouping algorithms in [Grouping Events into Issues](/data-management/event-grouping/). Learn how to override the default group in very advanced use cases in [Modify the Default Fingerprint](#modify-the-default-fingerprint)

`environment`

: Environments help you better filter issues, releases, and user feedback in the **Issue Details** page of the web UI. Learn how to set and [manage environments](../environments/)

`release`

: A release is a version of your code that you deploy to an environment. When enabled, releases also help you determine regressions between releases and their potential source as discussed in the [releases documentation](/workflow/releases/). For JavaScript developers, a release is also used for applying [source maps] to minified JavaScript to view original, untransformed source code.
