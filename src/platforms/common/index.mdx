On this page, we get you up and running with Sentry's SDK, so that it will automatically report errors and exceptions in your application.

If you don't already have an account and Sentry project established, head over to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/signup/), then return to this page.

## Install

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your applicationâ€™s runtime.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-install" />

## Configure

Configure Sentry as early as possible in your app. Once this is done, the Sentry SDK captures all unhandled exceptions.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-config" />

<Note><markdown>

We'll automatically assign you a Data Source Name (DSN), which looks like a standard URL. It's required by Sentry and configures the protocol, public key, server address, and project identifier. If you forget it, view _Settings -> Projects -> Client Keys (DSN)_ in sentry.io.

## Verify

This snippet includes an intentional error, so you can test that everything is working as soon as you set it up:

To view and resolve the recorded error, log into [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and open your project. Clicking on the error's title will open a page where you can see detailed information and mark it as resolved.
