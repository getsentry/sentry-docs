Debug symbols provide information that Sentry displays on the **Issue Details** page to help you triage an issue. We offer a range of methods to provide Sentry with debug symbols.

## When to Upload

With default settings, complete stack traces are available in your Dart error, out of the box, unless you use [`split-debug-info`](https://flutter.dev/docs/perf/app-size#reducing-app-size) and [`obfuscate`](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/obfuscate). In those cases, you need to upload the debug information files generated by the `flutter` build, so Sentry can show you proper stack traces.

<Note>

For Flutter iOS `split-debug-info` and `obfuscate` flags are not supported. This is a known tooling limitation, as discussed in [43612](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/43612) and [43274](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/43274).

For Flutter Desktop (Windows/macOS/Linux) `split-debug-info` and `obfuscate` flags are not supported yet. See this [issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dart/issues/433).

</Note>

Errors raised from the native layer in Flutter apps require certain debug information files to be uploaded. For example, an Android app can use `proguard` for minification and obfuscation. And when using NDK, dwarf debug files need to be uploaded. Flutter Web requires sourcemaps and iOS apps also require dwarf debug information files.

## Uploading for iOS and macOS

Sentry requires a dSYM upload to symbolicate your crash logs. The symbolication process unscrambles Appleâ€™s crash logs to reveal the function, file names, and line numbers of the crash. [Learn how to upload the dSYM files](/platforms/apple/dsym/).

##  Uploading for Android NDK

Native symbolication on Android requires a specific configuration. For good symbolication, set `android:extractNativeLibs="true"` in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file or `android.bundle.enableUncompressedNativeLibs=false` for [Android App Bundle](https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle) in your `gradle.properties` file.

If you use the [Android NDK](/platforms/android/using-ndk/), you must [upload files manually using our CLI](/product/cli/dif/#uploading-files).

<Note>

Sentry's Flutter SDK doesn't currently support the `uploadNativeSymbols` flag from the [Sentry Gradle Plugin](/platforms/android/proguard/).

</Note>

## Uploading with ProGuard

To use ProGuard with Sentry, upload the [Android Proguard/R8 mapping files](/platforms/android/proguard/) by either the recommended method of using our Gradle integration or manually by using [sentry-cli](/product/cli/dif/#proguard-mapping-upload).

## Uploading Source Maps for Flutter Web

You can also use our CLI to [upload source maps for Flutter Web](/product/cli/releases/#managing-release-artifacts).
