Debug symbols provide information that Sentry displays on the **Issue Details** page to help you triage an issue. We offer a range of methods to provide Sentry with debug symbols.

## When to Upload

With default settings, complete stack traces are available in your Dart error, out of the box, unless you use [`split-debug-info`](https://flutter.dev/docs/perf/app-size#reducing-app-size) and [`obfuscate`](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/obfuscate). In those cases, you need to upload the debug information files generated by the `flutter` build, so Sentry can show you proper stack traces.

<Note>

For Flutter Desktop (Windows/Linux) `split-debug-info` and `obfuscate` flags are not supported yet. See this [issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dart/issues/433).

</Note>

Errors raised from the native layer in Flutter apps require certain debug information files to be uploaded. For example, an Android app can use `proguard` for minification and obfuscation. And when using NDK, dwarf debug files need to be uploaded. Flutter Web requires sourcemaps and iOS apps also require dwarf debug information files.

## Sentry Dart Plugin

[Try out the Sentry Dart Plugin](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dart-plugin), which uploads debug symbols automatically for you, or follow the manual steps below.

## Uploading for iOS and macOS

Sentry requires a dSYM upload to symbolicate your crash logs. The symbolication process unscrambles Apple’s crash logs to reveal the function, file names, and line numbers of the crash. [Learn how to upload the dSYM files](/platforms/apple/dsym/).

If you use the `split-debug-info` and `obfuscate` flags, you need to upload the `*.dSYM` files instead of the `*.symbols` files generated by the Flutter build. The `*.dSYM` files are located in the `build` folder of your project and not the given `split-debug-info` folder.

## Uploading for Android NDK

If you are using `sentry_flutter` version earlier than 5.1, native symbolication on Android requires a specific configuration. For good symbolication, set `android:extractNativeLibs="true"` in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file or `android.bundle.enableUncompressedNativeLibs=false` for [Android App Bundle](https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle) in your `gradle.properties` file.

If you use the [Android NDK](/platforms/android/using-ndk/), you must [upload files manually using our CLI](/product/cli/dif/#uploading-files).

<Note>

Sentry's Flutter SDK doesn't currently support the `uploadNativeSymbols` flag from the [Sentry Gradle Plugin](/platforms/android/gradle/).

</Note>

## Uploading with ProGuard

To use ProGuard with Sentry, upload the [Android Proguard/R8 mapping files](/platforms/android/proguard/) by either the recommended method of using our Gradle integration or manually by using [sentry-cli](/product/cli/dif/#proguard-mapping-upload).

## Uploading Source Maps for Flutter Web

You can also use our CLI to [upload source maps for Flutter Web](/product/cli/releases/#managing-release-artifacts).

Source Context works out of the box for Flutter Web, only the Source Maps is required.

## Uploading Source Context for Flutter Android, iOS, and macOS

To enable [Source Context](/platforms/flutter/data-management/debug-files/source-context/) use the [`upload_sources`](/platforms/flutter/upload-debug/#sentry-dart-plugin) option.

Check out the [Native Symbolication on iOS/macOS](/platforms/flutter/troubleshooting/#native-symbolication-on-iosmacos) and [Source Context](/platforms/flutter/troubleshooting/#source-context) troubleshooting guides for more information.
