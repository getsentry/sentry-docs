Debug symbols provide information that Sentry displays on the **Issue Details** page to help you triage an issue. We offer a range of methods to provide Sentry with debug symbols.

## Uploading for iOS

Sentry requires a dSYM upload to symbolicate your crash logs. The symbolication process unscrambles Appleâ€™s crash logs to reveal the function, file names, and line numbers of the crash. [Learn how to upload the dSYM files](/platforms/apple/dsym/).

<Note>

Sentry's Flutter SDK doesn't currently support `split-debug-info` and `obfuscate` flags. This is a known tooling limitation, as discussed in [43612](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/43612) and [43274](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/43274).

</Note>

##  Uploading for Android NDK

If you use the [Android NDK](/platforms/android/using-ndk/), you must [upload files manually using our CLI](/product/cli/dif/#uploading-files).

<Note>

Sentry's Flutter SDK doesn't currently support the `uploadNativeSymbols` flag from the [Sentry Gradle Plugin](/platforms/android/proguard/).

</Note>

## Uploading with ProGuard

To use ProGuard with Sentry, upload the [Android Proguard/R8 mapping files](/platforms/android/proguard/) by either the recommended method of using our Gradle integration or manually by using [sentry-cli](/product/cli/dif/#proguard-mapping-upload).

## Uploading Source Maps for Flutter Web

You can also use our CLI to [upload source maps for Flutter Web](/product/cli/releases/#managing-release-artifacts).
