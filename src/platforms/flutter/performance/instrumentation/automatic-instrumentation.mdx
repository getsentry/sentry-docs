### Routing Instrumentation

Automatic routing instrumentation can be enabled by adding an instance of `SentryNavigationObserver` to your application's `navigatorObservers`. Transactions are started automatically when routing to new pages in your application.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

return MaterialApp(
  title: 'Home',
  home: HomeScreen(),
  navigatorObservers: [
    SentryNavigatorObserver()
  ],
);
```

The main route of your application will have the name `root "/"`. In order for transactions to be created automatically when navigation changes, you need to provide route names through your routes settings parameter.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

MaterialPageRoute(
  builder: (BuildContext context) => Settings(),
  settings: RouteSettings(name: 'Settings'),
)
```

The SDK sets the span `operation` to `navigation` and the `name` to the one provided in `RouteSettings`.

Transactions will be bound to the scope if no other transaction is currently bound to it.

If the transaction has no spans, the transaction will be dropped and not sent to Sentry, the reason is that there's no callback to identify when the screen has been loaded, so we rely on the child spans.

The started transactions will idle for a fixed amount of time, for which the default is `three seconds`. You can also change this by setting `autoFinishAfter` in the navigators constructor.

```dart
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

/// Change how long navigation transactions idle before being finished
SentryNavigatorObserver(
  autoFinishAfter: Duration(seconds: 5)
)
```

Child spans started will be attached to the transaction. If they run longer than the idle time, the transaction will be extended and finished when all its children are complete.

If children are finished before the idle timeout, the transaction end will be trimmed, and its end time will be set to the last child end time.

You can also opt out of this behaviour by setting `enableAutoTransactions` to false in the `SentryNavigatorObserver` constructor. You might do this when you only want to use navigation breadcrumbs, which can be enabled by setting the constructor parameter `setRouteNameAsTransaction` to `true`.

```dart
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

/// Only track navigation breadcrums
SentryNavigatorObserver(
  enableAutoTransactions: false,
  setRouteNameAsTransaction: true
)
```

### GoRouter Instrumentation

When using the [go_router](https://pub.dev/packages/go_router) library, the automatic routing instrumentation can be enabled by adding an instance of `SentryNavigationObserver` to your application's `GoRouter.observers`:

```dart
import 'package:go_router/go_router.dart';
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

final router = GoRouter(
  routes: ...,
  observers: [SentryNavigatorObserver()],
);
```

Everything else follows the [routing instrumentation](/platforms/flutter/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#routing-instrumentation) setup.

### User Interaction Instrumentation

The UI instrumentation, once enabled, captures transactions and adds breadcrumbs for a set of different user interactions, which include clicks, long clicks, taps, and so on.

Learn more in our [User Interaction Instrumentation](/platforms/flutter/integrations/user-interaction-instrumentation/).

### http.Client Library Instrumentation

The `http.Client` instrumentation, once added the `SentryHttpClient` and enabled the [performance](/platforms/flutter/performance/) feature, starts a span from an active transaction that's bound to the scope of each HTTP Request. The SDK sets the span `operation` to `http.client` and `description` to request `$METHOD $url`; for example, `GET https://sentry.io`.

The span finishes once the request has been executed. The span `status` depends on either the HTTP Response `code` or `SpanStatus.internalError()` if the `code` does not match any of Sentry's `SpanStatus`.

When the HTTP request throws an `Exception`, Sentry's SDK associates this exception to the running span. If you haven't set the SDK to swallow the exception and capture it, the span and `SentryEvent` will be linked when viewing it on the **Issue Details** page in sentry.io.

For more information see our [SentryHttpClient integration](/platforms/dart/configuration/integrations/http-integration/#performance-monitoring-for-http-requests).

### Dio HTTP Library Instrumentation

The Dio instrumentation starts a span from an active transaction that's bound to the scope of each HTTP request. The SDK sets the span `operation` to `http.client` and the `description` to request `$METHOD $url`. For example, `GET https://sentry.io`.

The span finishes once the request has been executed. The span `status` depends on either the HTTP response `code` or `SpanStatus.internalError()` if the `code` does not match any of Sentry's `SpanStatus` options.

When the HTTP request throws an `Exception`, Sentry's SDK associates this exception to the running span. If you haven't set the SDK to swallow the exception and capture it, the span and `SentryEvent` will be linked when viewing it on the **Issue Details** page in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

Learn more in our [Dio integration documentation](/platforms/dart/configuration/integrations/dio/#performance-monitoring-for-http-requests).

### App Start Instrumentation

The App Start Instrumentation provides insight into how long your application takes to launch. It tracks the length of time from the **earliest native process initialization** until the very first [PostFrameCallback](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/scheduler/SchedulerBinding/addPostFrameCallback.html) is triggered.

The SDK differentiates between a cold and a warm start, but doesn't track hot starts/resumes.

If you don't initialize the SDK early in the app's lifecycle, you can also customize the ending of the app start by disabling the `autoAppStart` flag and calling the `SentryFlutter.setAppStartEnd` function.

```dart
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

// Run my App and do my things first

// Initialize the Flutter SDK
Future<void> main() async {
  await SentryFlutter.init(
    (options) => options.autoAppStart = false,
  );
}

// End the App start
SentryFlutter.setAppStartEnd(DateTime.now().toUtc());
```

To opt out, flip the `enableAutoPerformanceTracing` flag:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  await SentryFlutter.init(
    (options) => options.enableAutoPerformanceTracing = false,
    appRunner: () => runApp(MyApp()),
  );
}
```

Cold and warm start are Mobile Vitals, which you can learn about in the [full documentation](/product/performance/mobile-vitals).

### Slow and Frozen Frames

Unresponsive UI and animation hitches annoy users and degrade the user experience. Two measurements to track these types of experiences are slow frames and frozen frames. If you want your app to run smoothly, you should try to avoid both. The SDK adds these two measurements for the transactions you capture.

To start getting the Mobile Vitals data, you have to set up the [routing instrumentation](/platforms/flutter/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#routing-instrumentation) or the [GoRouter instrumentation](/platforms/flutter/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#gorouter-instrumentation).

To opt out, flip the `enableAutoPerformanceTracing` flag:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  await SentryFlutter.init(
    (options) => options.enableAutoPerformanceTracing = false,
    appRunner: () => runApp(MyApp()),
  );
}
```

Slow and frozen frames are Mobile Vitals, which you can learn about in the [full documentation](/product/performance/mobile-vitals).

### AssetBundle Instrumentation

The [AssetBundle](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/services/AssetBundle-class.html) instrumentation provides insight into how long your app takes to load its assets, such as files. It can be enabled by wrapping the `runApp` method with a `DefaultAssetBundle` and `SentryAssetBundle`.

<SignInNote />

```dart
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  await SentryFlutter.init(
    (options) => options.dsn = '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
    appRunner: () => runApp(
      DefaultAssetBundle(
        bundle: SentryAssetBundle(),
        child: MyApp(),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

The `SentryAssetBundle` instrumentation starts a span from an active transaction that's bound to the scope of each `load` and `loadString` call. The SDK sets the span `operation` to `file.read`.

The `SentryAssetBundle` instrumentation starts a span from an active transaction that's bound to the scope of each `loadStructuredData` call. The SDK sets the span `operation` to `serialize`.

The `loadStructuredData` is an opt-out feature. The following example shows how to disable it:

```dart
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

SentryAssetBundle(enableStructuredDataTracing: false)
```

### File I/O Instrumentation

The Sentry-specific file I/O instrumentation starts a span from an active transaction that's bound to the scope of each file I/O operation. The SDK sets the span `operation` to `file.copy`, `file.write`, `file.delete`, `file.open`, `file.read` or `file.rename`, and `description` to `filename` (for example, `file.txt`).

In addition, the span contains other useful information such as `file.size` (raw number of bytes), `file.path` (an absolute path to the file) and `file.async` (`true` if the called method returns a `Future`, or `false` if it's a `Sync` call) as part of the `data` payload.

The span finishes once the operation has been executed. The span `status` is then set to `SpanStatus.ok` if successful, or `SpanStatus.internalError` if there was an error.

When the operation throws an `Exception`, Sentry's SDK associates it with the running span. If you haven't set the SDK to swallow and capture the exception, the span and `SentryEvent` will be shown as linked on the **Issue Details** page in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

Learn more about our [file I/O integration](/platforms/dart/configuration/integrations/file/).

### sqflite Database Instrumentation

The sqflite database instrumentation starts a span from an active transaction that's bound to the scope of each `CRUD` operation.

The span finishes once the operation has been executed. The span `status` is then set to `SpanStatus.ok` if successful, or `SpanStatus.internalError` if there was an error.

When the operation throws an `Exception`, Sentry's SDK associates it with the running span. If you haven't set the SDK to swallow and capture the exception, the span and `SentryEvent` will be shown as linked on the **Issue Details** page in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).
