_(New in version 7.2.0)_

The [sentry_sqflite](https://pub.dev/packages/sentry_sqflite) package provides `sqflite` support for database instrumentation. The source can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dart/tree/main/sqflite). Note, that to capture transactions, you have to first <PlatformLink to="/performance/">set up performance monitoring</PlatformLink>.

## Install

Add the `sentry_sqflite` dependency to install the sqflite database instrumentation.

```yml {filename:pubspec.yaml}
dependencies:
  sentry_flutter: ^{{@inject packages.version('sentry.dart.flutter', '7.2.0') }}
  sentry_sqflite: ^{{@inject packages.version('sentry.dart.sqflite', '7.2.0') }}
  sqflite: ^2.0.0
```

## Configure

There are four ways to configure the sqflite database instrumentation:

By using the global `databaseFactory`, (which is used by the `openDatabase` method). With this approach, every call to `openDatabase` will be instrumented, including from other packages:

```dart
import 'package:sentry_sqflite/sentry_sqflite.dart';
import 'package:sqflite/sqflite.dart';

databaseFactory = SentrySqfliteDatabaseFactory();
final database = await openDatabase('path/to/db');
```

If you're using the `FFI` factories, you can instrument the `SentrySqfliteDatabaseFactory` with its factory:

```dart
import 'package:sentry_sqflite/sentry_sqflite.dart';
import 'package:sqflite/sqflite.dart';

databaseFactory = SentrySqfliteDatabaseFactory(databaseFactory: databaseFactoryFfi);
final database = await openDatabase('path/to/db');
```

By using the `openDatabaseWithSentry` wrapper. With this approach, only the database opened with this method will be instrumented:

```dart
import 'package:sentry_sqflite/sentry_sqflite.dart';
import 'package:sqflite/sqflite.dart';

final database = await openDatabaseWithSentry('path/to/db');
// or final database = await openReadOnlyDatabaseWithSentry('path/to/db');
```

By using the `SentryDatabase` wrapper, which can be used to instrument any `Database` instance:

```dart
import 'package:sentry_sqflite/sentry_sqflite.dart';
import 'package:sqflite/sqflite.dart';

final database = await openDatabase('path/to/db');
final sentryDatabase = SentryDatabase(database);
```

After configuring via one of the above methods, every `CRUD` operation, including database transactions and batches, will be automatically instrumented and sent to Sentry.

The spans' `operation` are either `db`, `db.sql.execute`, `db.sql.query` or `db.sql.transaction`. Its `description` is the SQL statement using placeholders instead of its values due to the possibility of containing PII.
