_(New in version 6.17.0)_

The UI instrumentation, once enabled, captures transactions and adds breadcrumbs for a set of different user interactions, which include clicks, long clicks, taps, and so on. The SDK composes the transaction name from the `key` of the `Widget` that captured the user interaction (for example, `login_button`). The transaction operation is set to `ui.action.click`.

If the view doesn't have the `key` assigned, the transaction and the breadcrumb won't be captured because it can't be uniquely identified otherwise.

The `key` value should be unique across the whole application because the transactions are grouped by its name.

<Note>

Capturing transactions requires that you first <PlatformLink to="/performance/">set up performance monitoring</PlatformLink> if you haven't already.

</Note>

The UI instrumentation tracing is an opt-out feature. The following example shows how to disable it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  await SentryFlutter.init(
    (options) => options.enableUserInteractionTracing = false,
    appRunner: () => runApp(SentryUserInteractionWidget(child: MyApp())),
  );
}
```

The UI instrumentation breadcrumbs are enabled by default, but you can disable them by setting the `enableUserInteractionBreadcrumbs` option to `false`.

Breadcrumbs don't contain the `Widget` labels, text, and so on, since they might include PII. However, if you want to capture them, you can enable capturing this information by setting the `sendDefaultPii` option to `true`.

The transaction finishes automatically after it reaches the specified [idleTimeout](/platforms/flutter/configuration/options/#idle-timeout) and all of its child spans are finished. The `idleTimeoout` defaults to `3000` milliseconds (three seconds). You can also disable the idle timeout by setting it to `null`, but the transaction must be finished manually in this case.

<Note>

If the UI transaction has idled, but didn't have any child spans added, it will be dropped.

</Note>

To finish the transaction manually, you can:

```dart
import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';

final span = Sentry.getSpan()
await span?.finish();
```

Transactions are always bound to the `Scope` automatically if there's none set. Because of that, you can create spans using custom instrumentation, and those spans will be automatically associated with the running UI transaction.

```dart
import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';

Future<void> loadUserDataOnClick() async {
  final span = Sentry.getSpan();
  final innerSpan = span?.startChild('loadUserData');
  // omitted code
  await innerSpan?.finish();
}
```

When the UI transaction is not finished yet, but the user makes a new interaction, the SDK automatically finishes the previous UI transaction. This is because only one transaction can be bound to the scope at a time. However, if the same view has been interacted with (for example, an `ElevatedButton` was clicked again within the `idleTimeout` window), the idle timer will be reset and the transaction duration will be extended with the `idleTimeout` value.
