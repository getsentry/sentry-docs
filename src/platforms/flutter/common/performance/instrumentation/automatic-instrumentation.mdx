### http.Client Library Instrumentation

The `http.Client` instrumentation, once added the `SentryHttpClient` and enabled the `networkTracing` feature, starts a span out of the active span bound to the scope for each HTTP Request. The SDK sets the span `operation` to `http.client` and `description` to request `$method and $URL`; for example, `GET https://sentry.io`.

The span finishes once the request has been executed. The span `status` depends on either the HTTP Response `code` or `SpanStatus.internalError()` if the `code` does not match any of Sentry's `SpanStatus`.

When the HTTP request throws an `Exception`, Sentry's SDK associates this exception to the running span. If you haven't set the SDK to swallow the exception and capture it, the span and SentryEvent will be linked when viewing it on the **Issue Details** page in sentry.io.

For more information see our [SentryHttpClient integration](/platforms/dart/configuration/integrations/http-integration/#performance-monitoring-for-http-requests).

### Routing Instumentation

Automatic routing instrumentation can be enabled by adding an instance of `SentryNavigationObserver` to your application's `navigatorObservers`. Transactions are started automatically when routing to new pages in your application.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

return MaterialApp(
  title: 'Home',
  home: HomeScreen(),
  navigatorObservers: [
    SentryNavigatorObserver()
  ],
);
```

The main route of your application will have the name `root "/"`. In order for transactions to be created automatically when navigation changes, you need to provide route names through your routes setttings parameter.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

MaterialPageRoute(
  builder: (BuildContext context) => Settings(),
  settings: RouteSettings(name: 'Settings'),
)
```

The SDK sets the span `operation` to `navigation` and the `name` to the one provided in `RouteSettings`.

Transactions will be bound to the scope if no other transaction is currently bound to it.

The started transactions will idle for a fixed amount of time, for which the default is `three seconds`. You can also change this by setting `autoFinishAfter` in the navigators constuctor.

```dart
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

/// Change how long navigation transactions idle before being finished
SentryNavigatorObserver(
  autoFinishAfter: Duration(seconds: 5)
)
```

Child spans started will be attached to the transaction. If they run longer than the idle time, the transaction will be extended and finished when all its children are complete.

If children are finished before the idle timeout, the transaction end will be trimmed, and its end time will be set to the last child end time.

You can also opt out of this behaviour by setting `enableAutoTransactions` to false in the `SentryNavigatorObserver` constructor. You might do this when you only want to use navigation breadcrumbs, which can be enabled by setting the constructor parameter `setRouteNameAsTransaction` to `true`.

```dart
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

/// Only track navigation breadcrums
SentryNavigatorObserver(
  enableAutoTransactions: false,
  setRouteNameAsTransaction: true
)
```

### App Start Instrumentation

<Note>

This feature is available on Sentry Flutter SDK `6.4.0-beta.4` and above. Features available in Beta are still in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.

</Note>

The App Start Instrumentation provides insight into how long your application takes to launch. It tracks the length of time from the **earliest native process initialization** until the very first [PostFrameCallback](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/scheduler/SchedulerBinding/addPostFrameCallback.html) is triggered.

The SDK differentiates between a cold and a warm start, but doesn't track hot starts/resumes.

To start getting the Mobile Vitals data, you have to set up the [Routing instrumentation](platforms/flutter/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#routing-instumentation).

In case you do not initialize the SDK early in the App's lifecycle, you can also customize the ending of the App start, you have to disable the `autoAppStart` flag and call the `SentryFlutter.setAppStartEnd` function.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

// Run my App and do my things first

// Initialize the Flutter SDK
Future<void> main() async {
  await SentryFlutter.init(
    (options) => options.autoAppStart = false,
  );
}

// End the App start
SentryFlutter.setAppStartEnd(DateTime.now().toUtc());
```

In case you want to opt-out, you can flip the `enableAutoPerformanceTracking` flag:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  await SentryFlutter.init(
    (options) => options.enableAutoPerformanceTracking = false,
    appRunner: () => runApp(MyApp()),
  );
}

Cold and warm start are Mobile Vitals, which you can learn about in the [full documentation](/product/performance/mobile-vitals).
```
