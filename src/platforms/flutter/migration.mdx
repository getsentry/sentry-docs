## Migrating from `sentry_dart` `4.0.x` to `sentry_dart` `5.0.0`

In addition to the changes of [sentry_dart](/platforms/dart/migrate/)
there are the following changes:

- `SentryFlutterOptions.enableLifecycleBreadcrumbs` was removed. Use `SentryFlutterOptions.enableAppLifecycleBreadcrumbs` instead.
- The Web Plugin Registrant import changed from 'package:sentry_flutter/src/sentry_flutter_web.dart'; to 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter_web.dart';
  - This could lead to breaking changes. Typically it shouldn't because the referencing file is auto-generated.
