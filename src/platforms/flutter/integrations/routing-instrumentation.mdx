Sentry's routing instrumentation for Flutter automatically tracks and reports page navigation events in your app.
It supports both [traditional Flutter routing](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/navigation) and the [GoRouter](https://pub.dev/packages/go_router) package.

<Note>

The routing instrumentation feature is shipped with Sentry's Flutter SDK automatically.

</Note>

## Instrumentation Behaviour

Before diving into the configuration, it's important to understand how routing instrumentation behaves:

- Routing transactions attach to the current scope unless another transaction is already there.
- If the routing transaction has no child spans attached, the transaction will be dropped and not sent to Sentry because there's no callback to identify when the screen has been loaded.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure:

1. The Sentry Flutter SDK is initialized. Learn more [here](/platforms/flutter/#configure).
2. Performance Monitoring is set up. Learn more [here](/platforms/flutter/performance/).

## Configure

### 1. Add `SentryNavigationObserver`

Add an instance of `SentryNavigationObserver` to your application's `navigatorObservers`.

```dart {tabTitle: Flutter Routing}
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

return MaterialApp(
  title: 'Home',
  home: HomeScreen(),
  navigatorObservers: [
    SentryNavigatorObserver()
  ],
);
```

```dart {tabTitle: GoRouter}
import 'package:go_router/go_router.dart';
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

final router = GoRouter(
  routes: ...,
  observers: [SentryNavigatorObserver()],
);
```

### 2. Define Route Names

By default the application's main route name is `"/"`.
The instrumentation sets the span `operation` to `navigation` and the span `name` to the provided route name.
For transactions to be created when navigation changes, you need to provide route names:
 - GoRouter: use the `name` parameter to set the route name.
 - Flutter routing: use `RouteSettings` and set the name in the constructor.

```dart {tabTitle: Flutter Routing}
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

/// Setting the route name is required
MaterialPageRoute(
  builder: (BuildContext context) => Settings(),
  settings: RouteSettings(name: 'Settings'),
)
```

```dart {tabTitle: GoRouter}
import 'package:go_router/go_router.dart';
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

final GoRouter _router = GoRouter(
  observers: [SentryNavigatorObserver()],
  routes: <RouteBase>[
    GoRoute(
      path: '/',
      name: 'Home',
      builder: (BuildContext context, GoRouterState state) {
        return const HomeScreen();
      },
      routes: <RouteBase>[
        GoRoute(
          path: 'settings',
          name: 'Settings',
          builder: (BuildContext context, GoRouterState state) {
            return const Settings();
          },
        ),
      ],
    ),
  ],
);
```

## Verify

### 1. Implement a Test Widget:

Set up a new widget that executes an expensive operation.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';

/// Widget that executes an expensive operation
class MyWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  const MyWidget({super.key});

  @override
  MyWidgetState createState() => MyWidgetState();
}

class MyWidgetState extends State<MyWidget> {
  static const delayInSeconds = 5;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _doComplexOperation();
  }

  /// Attach child spans to the routing transaction
  /// or the transaction will not be sent to Sentry.
  Future<void> _doComplexOperation() async {
    final activeTransaction = Sentry.getSpan();
    final childSpan = activeTransaction?.startChild('complex operation',
    description: 'running a $delayInSeconds seconds operation');
    await Future.delayed(const Duration(seconds: delayInSeconds));
    childSpan?.finish();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ...
  }
}
```

### 2. Navigate to the Widget:

Use the navigator to transition to your widget. This should create and send a transaction named after the widget's route.

```dart {tabTitle: Flutter Routing}
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'my_widget.dart';

/// Push to a new screen
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(
    settings: const RouteSettings(name: 'MyWidget'),
    builder: (context) => MyWidget(),
  ),
);
```

```dart {tabTitle: GoRouter}
import 'package:go_router/go_router.dart';
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

context.push('/settings')
```

Log into [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and open your project's performance page to see the transaction `MyWidget`.

## Additional Configuration

### Auto Finish Time

Adjust the duration before a routing transaction automatically finishes. The default is 3 seconds.

```dart
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

/// Change how long navigation transactions idle before being finished
SentryNavigatorObserver(
  autoFinishAfter: Duration(seconds: 5)
)
```

When configuring the `autoFinishAfter` parameter, consider the following behaviours:

- Started child spans will be attached to the navigation transaction - for example the `MyWidget` transaction.
- If child spans finish after the `autoFinishAfter` time, the transaction extends and finishes when all child spans finished.
- If child spans finish before the `autoFinishAfter` time, the transaction's end time will be set to the last child end time.

### Breadcrumb Tracking Only

Set `enableAutoTransactions` to `false` if you only want to track navigation breadcrumbs.
Enabled by default.

```dart
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

/// Only track navigation breadcrumbs
SentryNavigatorObserver(
  enableAutoTransactions: false,
)
```

### Override Transaction Name

Set `setRouteNameAsTransaction` to `true` to override the transaction name with the route name.
An existing transaction in the scope 'CustomTransaction' will be renamed to 'MyWidget' for example.
Disabled by default.

```dart
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

/// Override transaction name with route name
SentryNavigatorObserver(
  setRouteNameAsTransaction: true,
)
```
