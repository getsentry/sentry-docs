The user feedback API gives you the possibility to collect user information when an event occurs. Sentry pairs the feedback with the original event, giving you additional insight into issues.
Sentry needs the `eventId` to be able to associate the user feedback to the corresponding event. To get the `eventId`, for example, you can use the <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#before-send">beforeSend</PlatformLink> or the return value of the methods capturing an event.

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

let eventId = SentrySDK.capture(message: "My message.")

let userFeedback = UserFeedack(eventId: eventId)
userFeedback.comments = "It broke."
userFeedback.email = "john.doe@example.com"
userFeedback.name = "John Doe"
SentrySDK.capture(userFeedback: userFeedback)
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

SentryId *eventId = [SentrySDK captureMessage:@"My message"];

SentryUserFeedback *userFeedback = [[SentryUserFeedback alloc] initWithEventId:eventId];
userFeedback.comments = @"It broke.";
userFeedback.email = @"john.doe@example.com";
userFeedback.name = @"John Doe";
[SentrySDK captureUserFeedback:userFeedback];
```
