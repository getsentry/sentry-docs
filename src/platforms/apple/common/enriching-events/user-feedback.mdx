The user feedback API provides the ability to collect user information when an event occurs. Sentry pairs the feedback with the original event, giving you additional insight into issues.
Sentry needs the `eventId` to be able to associate the user feedback to the corresponding event. To get the `eventId`, for example, you can use the <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#before-send">beforeSend</PlatformLink> or the return value of the methods capturing an event.

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

let eventId = SentrySDK.capture(message: "My message.")

let userFeedback = UserFeedback(eventId: eventId)
userFeedback.comments = "It broke."
userFeedback.email = "john.doe@example.com"
userFeedback.name = "John Doe"
SentrySDK.capture(userFeedback: userFeedback)
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

SentryId *eventId = [SentrySDK captureMessage:@"My message"];

SentryUserFeedback *userFeedback = [[SentryUserFeedback alloc] initWithEventId:eventId];
userFeedback.comments = @"It broke.";
userFeedback.email = @"john.doe@example.com";
userFeedback.name = @"John Doe";
[SentrySDK captureUserFeedback:userFeedback];
```

To capture user feedback regarding a crash, use the `SentryOptions.onCrashedLastRun` callback.
This callback gets called shortly after the initialization of the SDK when the last
program execution terminated with a crash. It is not guaranteed that this is called on the main thread.

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    options.onCrashedLastRun = { event in
        // capture user feedback
    }
}

```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    options.onCrashedLastRun = ^void(SentryEvent * _Nonnull event) {
        // capture user feedback
    };
}];
```
