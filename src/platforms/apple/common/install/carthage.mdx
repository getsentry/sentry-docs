If you're using Sentry via Carthage on Macs with Apple Silicon, please use Carthage >= 0.37.0, which introduced [support for XCFramework](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/releases/tag/0.37.0).

To integrate Sentry into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your _Cartfile_:

```ruby
github "getsentry/sentry-cocoa" "{{ packages.version('sentry.cocoa') }}"
```

Run `carthage update` to download the framework and drag the built _Sentry.framework_ into your Xcode project.

We also provide a pre-built version for every release which can be downloaded at [releases on GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/releases).
