To integrate Sentry into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your _Cartfile_:

```ruby
github "getsentry/sentry-cocoa" "{{ packages.version('sentry.cocoa') }}"
```

Run `carthage update` to download the framework and drag the built _Sentry.framework_ into your Xcode project.

We also provide a pre-built version for every release which can be downloaded at [releases on GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/releases).
