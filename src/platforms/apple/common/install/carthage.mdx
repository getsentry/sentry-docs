To integrate Sentry into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your _Cartfile_:

```ruby
github "getsentry/sentry-cocoa" "{{@inject packages.version('sentry.cocoa') }}"
```

Run `carthage update` to download the framework and drag the built _Sentry.xcframework_ into your Xcode project. We also provide a pre-built version for every release, which can be downloaded at [releases on GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/releases).

Sentry's Carthage setup generates 3 different frameworks:

- Sentry
- SentryPrivate
- SentrySwiftUI

_Sentry_ is required for all projects. _SentrySwiftUI_ is required to measure the performance of your SwiftUI views. _SentryPrivate_ is only needed if you changed the carthage build process to generate static frameworks.

## Macs with Apple Silicon and XCFrameworks

If you're using Sentry via Carthage on Macs with Apple Silicon or want to use XCFrameworks, please use Carthage >= 0.37.0, which introduced [support for XCFramework](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/releases/tag/0.37.0). Make sure to use `carthage build --use-xcframeworks --no-use-binaries` after running `carthage update --use-xcframeworks`. Carthage 0.37.0 needs to rebuild the XCFramework from source because it can't handle GitHub dependencies that download binaries. Learn more in their [release notes](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/releases/tag/0.37.0).
