To integrate Sentry into your Xcode project using Swift Package Manager (SPM), open your App in Xcode and open **File > Add Packages**. Then add the SDK by entering the git repo url in the top right search field:

```
https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa.git
```

You can define your dependency rule by selecting the SDK version (or branch), and then click the "Add Package" button.

Alternatively, when using SPM version 5.2 or later and your project uses `Package.swift` file to manage dependencies, you can specify the target with name:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
.package(url: "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa", from: "{{ packages.version('sentry.cocoa') }}"),
```

<Note>

Version tags or branches need to have the Package.swift file in it or Xcode won't be able to install the package. This means versions previous to `4.4.3` *cannot* be installed using SPM.
