title: Swift Package Manager (SPM)
---

To integrate Sentry into your Xcode project using Swift Package Manager (SPM), open your App in Xcode and open `File` -> `Swift Packages` -> `Add Package Dependency`. Then add the SDK by entering the git repo url `https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa.git`, and select a version (or branch) on the next page.

When using SPM version 5.2 or later, you must specify the the target name too:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
.package(name: "Sentry", url: "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa", from: "version"),
```

Version tags or branches need to have the `Package.swift` file in it or Xcode won't be able to install the package.
