To integrate Sentry into your Xcode project using Swift Package Manager (SPM), open your App in Xcode and open `File` -> `Add Packages`. Then add the SDK by entering the git repo url `https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa.git` on the top-right search field. Define you dependecy rule by selecting the SDK version (or branch), then press "Add Package" button.

When using SPM version 5.2 or later and your project uses `Package.swift` file to manage dependencies, you must specify the the target name too:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
.package(name: "Sentry", url: "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa", from: "{{ packages.version('sentry.cocoa') }}"),
```


NOTE: Version tags or branches need to have the Package.swift file in it or Xcode won't be able to install the package. Thus versions previous to `4.4.3` can't be installed via SPM!
