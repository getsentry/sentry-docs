To integrate Sentry into your Xcode project using Swift Package Manager (SPM), open your App in Xcode and open **File > Add Packages**. Then add the SDK by entering the git repo url in the top right search field:

```
https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa.git
```

You can define your dependency rule by selecting the SDK version (or branch), and then click the "Add Package" button.

Alternatively, when your project uses a `Package.swift` file to manage dependencies, you can specify the target with:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
.package(url: "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa", from: "{{@inject packages.version('sentry.cocoa') }}"),
```

<Note>

Version tags or branches need to have the Package.swift file in it or Xcode won't be able to install the package. This means versions previous to `4.4.3` _cannot_ be installed using SPM.
