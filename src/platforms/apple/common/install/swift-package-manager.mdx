To integrate Sentry into your Xcode project using Swift Package Manager (SPM), open your App in Xcode and open `File` -> `Add Packages`. Then add the SDK by entering the git repo url `https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa.git` on the top-right search field. Define you dependecy rule by selecting the SDK version (or branch), then press "Add Package" button.

NOTE: Version tags or branches need to have the Package.swift file in it or Xcode won't be able to install the package. Thus versions previous to `4.4.3` can't be installed via SPM!
