## Installation {#install}

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-install" />

For other installation methods, please see our [documentation](install/).

## Configuration {#configure}

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-config" />

## Debug Symbols {#debug-symbols}

Before capturing crashes, you need to provide debug information to Sentry. Debug information is provided by uploading dSYM files using one of two methods, dependent on your setup:

- [With Bitcode](dsym/#dsym-with-bitcode)
- [Without Bitcode](dsym/#dsym-without-bitcode)

## Verify

To validate that the SDK is correctly set up and connected to your Sentry project, capture a test message:

<PlatformContent includePath="capture-message" />

If everything is working correctly, this message should appear within seconds in your Sentry project.

## Crash Handling

Our SDK hooks into all signal and exception handlers, except for MacOS. If you are using MacOS, please see the additional step provided in [Advanced Usage](usage/)
To try it out, the SDK provides a test crash function:

<PlatformContent includePath="trigger-crash" />

_If you crash with a debugger attached, nothing will happen._

Crashes are submitted only upon re-launch of the application. To view the crash in Sentry, close your app and re-launch it.
