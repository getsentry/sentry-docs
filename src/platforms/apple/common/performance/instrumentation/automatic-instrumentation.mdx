## UIViewController Instrumentation

This feature is available for iOS, tvOS, and Mac Catalyst, and only works for UIViewControllers.

The UIViewController Instrumentation, once enabled, captures transactions when your app loads an in-app [UIViewController][UIViewController]. However, the SDK doesn't capture transactions for UIViewControllers of third-party libraries or SwiftUI.
The SDK sets the transaction name to the name of the ViewController, including the module — for example, `Your_App.MainViewController` — and the transaction operation to `ui.load`.

The SDK creates spans to provide insight into the time consumed by each of the methods shown in the screenshot below. Due to implementation limitations, the SDK only adds a span for loadView if the instrumented view controller implements it. The SDK adds spans for all other methods, whether you implement them in your view controller or not.

To disable the UIViewController Instrumentation:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    options.enableUIViewControllerTracking = false
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    options.enableUIViewControllerTracking = NO;
}];
```

## App Start Instrumentation

This feature is available for iOS, tvOS, and Mac Catalyst.

The App Start Instrumentation provides insight into how long your application takes to launch. It adds spans for different phases, from the application launch to the first auto-generated UI transaction.
To enable this feature enable `AutoUIPerformanceTracking`.

<Alert level="info" title="Important">

Since iOS 15, the system might decide to [pre-warm](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/app_and_environment/responding_to_the_launch_of_your_app/about_the_app_launch_sequence#3894431) your app by already creating the process before the user opens it. In such cases, we can't reliably measure the app start and drop it since [sentry-cocoa 7.18.0](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/releases/tag/7.18.0). We are working on a fix for this. Follow the [GH issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/issues/1897) for more details.

</Alert>

The SDK differentiates between a cold and a warm start, but doesn't track hot starts/resumes.

* __Cold start__: App launched for the first time, after a reboot or update. The app is not in memory and no process exists.
* __Warm start__: App launched at least once, is partially in memory, and no process exists.

The SDK uses the process start time as the beginning of the app start and the [`UIWindowDidBecomeVisibleNotification`][UIWindow] as the end. The SDK creates the following spans:
* __Pre Main__: From the process start time to the runtime init.
* __UIKit and Application Init__: From the runtime init to the [`didFinishLaunchingNotification`][didFinishLaunching].
* __Initial Frame Render__: From the [`didFinishLaunchingNotification`][didFinishLaunching] to [`UIWindowDidBecomeVisibleNotification`][UIWindow].

Cold and warm start are Mobile Vitals, which you can learn about in the [full documentation](/product/performance/mobile-vitals).

## Slow and Frozen Frames

This feature is available for iOS, tvOS, and Mac Catalyst.

Unresponsive UI and animation hitches annoy users and degrade the user experience. Two measurements to track these types of experiences are *slow frames* and *frozen frames*. If you want your app to run smoothly, you should try to avoid both. The SDK adds these two measurements for the transactions you capture.

The detail view of the transaction displays the slow, frozen, and total frames:

Slow and frozen frames are Mobile Vitals, which you can learn about in the [full documentation](/product/performance/mobile-vitals).

## HTTP Instrumentation

The Sentry SDK adds spans for outgoing HTTP requests to ongoing transactions bound to the Scope. Currently, the SDK supports requests with [NSURLSession][NSURLSession], but not the legacy [NSURLConnection][NSURLConnection] yet. The SDK attaches auto-generated transactions automatically to the Scope if there is no other transaction bound. When starting a transaction, you can use `bindToScope` to indicate whether the SDK should bind the new transaction to the Scope or not.

To disable the HTTP instrumentation:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    options.enableNetworkTracking = false
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    options.enableNetworkTracking = NO;
}];
```

## File I/O Instrumentation

<Alert level="info" title="Important">

This is an experimental feature and requires an opt-in. Experimental features are still a work-in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.

</Alert>

The Sentry SDK adds spans for file I/O operations to ongoing transactions bound to the scope. Currently, the SDK supports operations with [NSData][NSData], but many other APIs like [NSFileManager][NSFileManager], [NSString][NSString] and [NSBundle][NSBundle] uses [NSData][NSData].
This feature is experimental and is disabled by default.

To enable file I/O instrumentation:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    options.enableFileIOTracking = true
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    options.enableFileIOTracking = YES;
}];
```

## Core Data Instrumentation

<Alert level="info" title="Important">

This is an experimental feature and requires an opt-in. Experimental features are still a work-in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.

</Alert>

The Sentry SDK adds spans for Core Data operations to ongoing transactions bound to the scope. Currently, the SDK supports fetch and save operations with [NSManagedObjectContext](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/nsmanagedobjectcontext).
To enable core data instrumentation:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    options.enableCoreDataTracking = true
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    options.enableCoreDataTracking = YES;
}];
```

## User Interaction Instrumentation

<Alert level="info" title="Important">

This is an experimental feature and requires an opt-in. Experimental features are still a work-in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.

</Alert>

The UI instrumentation, once enabled, captures transactions for clicks. The UI instrumentation is disabled by default, but you can enable it by setting:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    options.enableUserInteractionTracing = true
}
```
```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    options.enableUserInteractionTracing = YES;
}];
```

The SDK composes the transaction name out of the host `UIViewController` and the method that the `UIView` is calling; for example, `YourApp_LoginUIViewController.loginButton`. The transaction operation is set to `ui.action` plus the interaction type `click`. The transaction finishes automatically after it reaches the specified [idleTimeout](/platforms/android/configuration/options/#idle-timeout) and all of its child spans are finished. The `idleTimeoout` defaults to `3000` milliseconds (three seconds).

<Note>

If the UI transaction has idled, but didn't have any child spans added, it will be dropped.

</Note>

The SDK binds user interaction transactions to the `Scope` automatically if there's no other transaction set. Because of that, you can create spans using manual instrumentation, and those spans will be automatically associated with the running UI transaction.

```Swift
import Sentry

func loadUserDataOnClick() {
    let span = SentrySDK.span
    let innerSpan = span?.startChild(operation: "loadUserData")
    // omitted code
    innerSpan?.finish()
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

- (void)loadUserDataOnClick {
    id<SentrySpan> span = SentrySDK.span;
    id<SentrySpan> innerSpan = [span startChildWithOperation:@"loadUserData"];
    // omitted code
    [innerSpan finish];
}
```

When the user interaction transaction is not finished yet, but the user makes a new interaction, or the SDK starts a new UIViewController transaction, the SDK automatically finishes the previous user interaction transaction. This is because only one transaction can be bound to the scope at a time. However, if the same view has been interacted with (for example, a `UIButton` was clicked again within the `idleTimeout` window), the idle timer will be reset and the transaction duration will be extended with the `idleTimeout` value.

## Opt Out

You can opt out of UIViewController, App Start, Slow and Frozen Frames, and HTTP Instrumentation using options:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    options.enableAutoPerformanceTracking = false
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    options.enableAutoPerformanceTracking = NO;
}];
```
