<Note>

This is a preview API, available in `7.2.0-beta.0` and above. Features available in a preview API are still in progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony. The API may be renamed, changed, or removed in a future version.
We welcome your [feedback](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/discussions/1187).

Capturing transactions requires that you first <PlatformLink to="/performance/">set up performance monitoring</PlatformLink> if you haven't already.

## UIViewController Instrumentation

This feature is available for iOS, tvOS, and Mac Catalyst, and only works for UIViewControllers.

The UIViewController Instrumentation, once enabled, captures transactions whenever your app loads a ViewController. The SDK sets the transaction name to the name of the ViewController, including the module; for example, `Your_App.MainViewController`, and the transaction operation to `ui.load`. The SDK creates spans to provide insight into the length of time each consumed by each of the following methods.

## App Start Instrumentation

This feature is available for iOS, tvOS, and Mac Catalyst.

The App Start Instrumentation provides insight into how long your application takes to launch. It adds spans for different phases, from the application launch to the first auto-generated UI transaction.
To enable this feature enable `AutoUIPerformanceTracking`. The SDK differentiates between a cold and a warm start, and doesn't track hot starts/resumes.
* __Cold start__: App launched for the first time, after a reboot or update. The app is not in memory and no process exists.
* __Warm start__: App launched at least once, is partially in memory, and no process exists.

The SDK uses the process start time as the beginning of the app start and the [`UIWindowDidBecomeVisibleNotification`][UIWindow] as the end. It creates the following spans:
* __Pre Main__: From the process start time to the runtime init.
* __UIKit and Application Init__: From the runtime init to the [`didFinishLaunchingNotification`][didFinishLaunching].
* __Initial Frame Render__: From the [`didFinishLaunchingNotification`][didFinishLaunching] to [`UIWindowDidBecomeVisibleNotification`][UIWindow].

## Slow and Frozen Frames

This feature is available for iOS, tvOS, and Mac Catalyst.

Unresponsive UI, animation hitches, or just jank annoy users and degrade the user experience. Two measurements to track this unwanted experience are slow frames and frozen frames. A smoothly running app should try to avoid both. That's why the SDK adds these two measurements for the transactions you capture.

- **Slow frames** are captured by the SDK when the app needs more than 16.67 ms for a frame. Typically, a phone or tablet renders with 60 frames per second (fps), though the frame rate can be higher, especially as 120 fps displays become popular. With 60 fps, every frame has 16.67 ms to render; slower than that, and the app has slow frames.
- **Frozen frames** are UI frames that take longer than 700 ms.  

The detail view of the transaction displays the slow, frozen, and total frames:

## HTTP Instrumentation

The SentrySDK adds spans for outgoing HTTP requests to ongoing transactions that are bound to the Scope.
The SDK attaches auto-generated transactions automatically to the Scope if there is no other transaction bound.
When starting a transaction, you can use bindToScope to indicate whether the SDK should bind the new transaction to the Scope or not.

## Opt Out

You can opt out of UIViewController, App Start, Slow and Frozen Frames, and HTTP Instrumentation using options:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    options.enableAutoPerformanceTracking = false
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    options.enableAutoPerformanceTracking = NO;
}];
```
