<Note>

Once you <PlatformLink to="/performance/">set up performance monitoring</PlatformLink>, the SDK enables the following features by default:

- UIViewController Tracking
- App Start Tracking
- Slow and Frozen Frames
- Network Tracking

</Note>

## UIViewController Tracking

This feature is available for iOS, tvOS, and Mac Catalyst, is enabled by default, and works for `UIViewControllers`.

UIViewController Tracking is enabled by default once you <PlatformLink to="/performance/">set up performance monitoring</PlatformLink>. This feature captures transactions when your app loads an in-app [UIViewController][UIViewController]. However, the SDK doesn't capture transactions for UIViewControllers of third-party libraries or SwiftUI.
The SDK sets the transaction name to the name of the ViewController, including the module — for example, `Your_App.MainViewController` — and the transaction operation to `ui.load`.

The SDK creates spans to provide insight into the time consumed by each of the methods shown in the screenshot below. Due to implementation limitations, the SDK only adds a span for loadView if the instrumented view controller implements it. The SDK adds spans for all other methods, whether you implement them in your view controller or not.

To disable the `UIViewController` Tracking:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    options.enableUIViewControllerTracking = false
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    options.enableUIViewControllerTracking = NO;
}];
```

## App Start Tracking

This feature is available for iOS, tvOS, and Mac Catalyst.

App Start Tracking is enabled by default once you <PlatformLink to="/performance/">set up performance monitoring</PlatformLink>. This feature provides insight into how long your application takes to launch. It adds spans for different phases, from the application launch to the first auto-generated UI transaction.
To enable this feature, enable `AutoUIPerformanceTracking`.

The SDK differentiates between a cold and a warm start, but doesn't track hot starts/resumes.

* __Cold start__: App launched for the first time, after a reboot or update. The app is not in memory and no process exists.
* __Warm start__: App launched at least once, is partially in memory, and no process exists.

The SDK uses the process start time as the beginning of the app start and the [`UIWindowDidBecomeVisibleNotification`][UIWindow] as the end. The SDK creates the following spans:
* __Pre Main__: From the process start time to the runtime init.
* __UIKit and Application Init__: From the runtime init to the [`didFinishLaunchingNotification`][didFinishLaunching].
* __Initial Frame Render__: From the [`didFinishLaunchingNotification`][didFinishLaunching] to [`UIWindowDidBecomeVisibleNotification`][UIWindow].

Cold and warm start are Mobile Vitals, which you can learn about in the [full documentation](/product/performance/mobile-vitals).

### Prewarmed App Start Tracking

Starting with iOS 15, the system might [prewarm](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/app_and_environment/responding_to_the_launch_of_your_app/about_the_app_launch_sequence#3894431) your app by creating the process before the user opens it. In these cases, we won’t be able to reliably measure the app start. However, with [sentry-cocoa 7.31.0](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/releases/tag/7.31.0), we’ve introduced an `enablePreWarmedAppStartTracking` feature (still in its experimental phase), which allows us to collect prewarmed app starts.

Once enabled, the SDK drops the first app start span if prewarming pauses. This approach shortens the app start duration, but it accurately represents the span of time from when a user clicks the app icon to when the app is responsive.
With this feature, the SDK differentiates between four different app start types:

* __Non-prewarmed cold start__ (See _cold start_  definition above.)
* __Non-prewarmed warm start__ (See _warm start_  definition above.)
* __Prewarmed cold start__
* __Prewarmed warm start__

You can filter for different app start types in [Discover](/product/discover-queries/) with `app_start_type:cold.prewarmed`, `app_start_type:warm.prewarmed`, `app_start_type:cold`, and `app_start_type:warm`.

To enable prewarmed app start tracking:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    options.enablePreWarmedAppStartTracking = true
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    options.enablePreWarmedAppStartTracking = YES;
}];
```

## Slow and Frozen Frames

This feature is available for iOS, tvOS, and Mac Catalyst.

Slow and Frozen Frames are enabled by default once you <PlatformLink to="/performance/">set up performance monitoring</PlatformLink>. Unresponsive UI and animation hitches annoy users and degrade the user experience. Two measurements to track these types of experiences are *slow frames* and *frozen frames*. If you want your app to run smoothly, you should try to avoid both. The SDK adds these two measurements for the transactions you capture.

The detail view of the transaction displays the slow, frozen, and total frames:

![Slow and Frozen Frames](slow-frozen-frames.png)

Slow and frozen frames are Mobile Vitals, which you can learn about in the [full documentation](/product/performance/mobile-vitals).

## Network Tracking

Network Tracking is enabled by default once you <PlatformLink to="/performance/">set up performance monitoring</PlatformLink>. The Sentry SDK adds spans for outgoing HTTP requests to ongoing transactions bound to the Scope. Currently, the SDK supports requests with [NSURLSession][NSURLSession], but not the legacy [NSURLConnection][NSURLConnection] yet. The SDK attaches auto-generated transactions automatically to the Scope if there is no other transaction bound. When starting a transaction, you can use `bindToScope` to indicate whether the SDK should bind the new transaction to the Scope or not.

To disable the HTTP instrumentation:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    options.enableNetworkTracking = false
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    options.enableNetworkTracking = NO;
}];
```

[NSURLConnection]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurlconnection

## File I/O Tracking

The Sentry SDK adds spans for file I/O operations to ongoing transactions bound to the scope. Currently, the SDK supports operations with [NSData][NSData], but many other APIs like [NSFileManager][NSFileManager], [NSString][NSString] and [NSBundle][NSBundle] uses [NSData][NSData].
This feature is experimental and is disabled by default.

To enable file I/O tracking:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    options.enableFileIOTracking = true
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    options.enableFileIOTracking = YES;
}];
```

[NSFileManager]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsfilemanager
[NSString]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsstring
[NSBundle]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsbundle

## Core Data Tracking

The Sentry SDK adds spans for Core Data operations to ongoing transactions bound to the scope. Currently, the SDK supports fetch and save operations with [NSManagedObjectContext](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/nsmanagedobjectcontext).
To enable core data tracking:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    options.enableCoreDataTracking = true
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    options.enableCoreDataTracking = YES;
}];
```

## User Interaction Tracing

<Alert level="info" title="Important">

This is an experimental feature and requires an opt-in. Experimental features are still a work-in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.

</Alert>

User interaction tracing, once enabled, captures transactions for clicks. User interaction tracing is disabled by default, but you can enable it by setting:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    options.enableUserInteractionTracing = true
}
```
```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    options.enableUserInteractionTracing = YES;
}];
```

The SDK composes the transaction name out of the host `UIViewController` and the method that the `UIView` is calling; for example, `YourApp_LoginUIViewController.loginButton`. The SDK sets the transaction operation to `ui.action`. If the SDK detects the interaction's origin was a click, it adds `click` as a suffix to the operation. The transaction finishes automatically after it reaches the specified [idleTimeout](/platforms/android/configuration/options/#idle-timeout) and all of its child spans are finished. The `idleTimeoout` defaults to `3000` milliseconds (three seconds).

<Note>

If the UI transaction has idled but didn't have any child spans added, the SDK will drop it.

</Note>

The SDK binds user interaction transactions to the `Scope` automatically if there's no other transaction set. Because of that, you can create spans using manual instrumentation, and those spans will be automatically associated with the running UI transaction.

```Swift
import Sentry

func loadUserDataOnClick() {
    let span = SentrySDK.span
    let innerSpan = span?.startChild(operation: "loadUserData")
    // omitted code
    innerSpan?.finish()
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

- (void)loadUserDataOnClick {
    id<SentrySpan> span = SentrySDK.span;
    id<SentrySpan> innerSpan = [span startChildWithOperation:@"loadUserData"];
    // omitted code
    [innerSpan finish];
}
```

When the user interaction transaction is not finished yet, but the user makes a new interaction, or the SDK starts a new UIViewController transaction, the SDK automatically finishes the previous user interaction transaction. This is because only one transaction can be bound to the scope at a time. However, if the same view has been interacted with (for example, a `UIButton` was clicked again within the `idleTimeout` window), the idle timer will be reset and the transaction duration will be extended with the `idleTimeout` value.

## Opt Out

You can opt out of all automatic instrumentations using the options:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    options.enableAutoPerformanceTracking = false
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    options.enableAutoPerformanceTracking = NO;
}];
```
