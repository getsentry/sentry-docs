<Include name="beta-note.mdx" />

You can monitor the performance of your views in a SwiftUI project with SentrySwiftUI library.

Install it with CocoaPod:

```ruby
platform :ios, '13.0'
use_frameworks! # This is important

target 'YourApp' do
  pod 'SentrySwiftUI'
end
```

Or by importing sentry-cocoa repository (https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa) with SPM.

> If you plan to add _SentrySwiftUI_, you don`t need to also add _Sentry_ library since the former dependents on the latter.

In order to start monitoring the performance of your views, you need to wrap it with `SentryTracedView`, like this:
```swift {tabTitle:Swift}

import SentrySwiftUI

var body: some View {
    SentryTracedView("<NAME YOUR TRANSACTION>"){
        List {
        }
    }
}
```

You may omit the transaction name, Sentry will use the root view type as name, in the previous example the transaction name would be `List`.

Alternatively, you can use a modifier like this:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}

import SentrySwiftUI

var body: some View {
    List {

    }.sentryTrace("<NAME YOUR TRANSACTION>")
}
```

It is possible to use nested `SentryTracedView` to have a more granular transaction.


```swift {tabTitle:Swift}

import SentrySwiftUI

var body: some View {
    SentryTracedView("My Awesome Screen"){
        HStack {
            SentryTracedView("Menu") {
                List{
                }
            }
            SentryTracedView("Content") {
                VStack{
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This is the result
