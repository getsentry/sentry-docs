You can monitor the performance of your views in a SwiftUI project with SentrySwiftUI library.

Install it with CocoaPod:

```ruby
platform :ios, '13.0'
use_frameworks! # This is important

target 'YourApp' do
  pod 'SentrySwiftUI'
end
```

Or by importing sentry-cocoa repository (https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa) with SPM.


In order to use it, you need to wrap your view with `SentryTracerView`, like this:
```swift {tabTitle:Swift}

import SentrySwiftUI

var body: some View {
    SentryTracedView("<NAME YOU TRANSACTION>"){
        //... Your view content
    }
}
```

You may omit the transaction name, Sentry will use the root view type as name.

Alternatively you can use a modifier like this:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}

import SentrySwiftUI

var body: some View {
    VStack {

    }.sentryTrace("<NAME YOUR TRANSACTION>")
}
```
