This integration tracks app hangs. This feature is available for iOS, tvOS, MacOS and watchOS.

Many reasons can make the app became unresponsive, from a long running code to an infinite loop bug, and this is extremelly annoying to the end user.
With App Hangs tracking it's possible to detect this problem and fix it very quickly.

App hangs detection integration has a default timeout of 2 seconds, which means, if the app became unresponsive for 2 seconds it creates an error event.
The event has the stacktrace of all running threads, this way you can easy detect where the problem occurs.

To use this feature, all you need to do is this:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    options.enableAppHangTracking = true
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    options.enableAppHangTracking = YES;
}];

```

If you want to change the timeout, you can do so by changing appHangTimeoutInterval option:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    options.appHangTimeoutInterval = 1
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    options.appHangTimeoutInterval = 1;
}];

```
