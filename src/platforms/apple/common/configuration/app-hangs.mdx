This integration tracks app hangs. This feature is available on iOS, tvOS, and macOS.

There are many reasons an app can become unresponsive, from long running code to an infinite loop bug, and this can be frustrating to the end user.
With app hang tracking, you can detect and fix this problem.

The app hang detection integration has a default timeout of two (2) seconds. This means, that if the app is unresponsive for two seconds or more, the SDK creates an error event. With 7.24.0, we've improved the algorithm to detect app hangs sooner, decreasing it from `appHangTimeoutInterval * 2` to `appHangTimeoutInterval * 1.2`.

The event has the stack trace of all running threads so you can easily detect where the problem occurred. The SDK reports an app hang immediately but doesn't report the exact duration because the [watchdog](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/addressing-watchdog-terminations) could kill the app any time when blocking the main thread.

When watchdog termination tracking is enabled, the app hang code is disabled, runs in the background, and wonâ€™t report app hangs. This is done to minimize the number of false errors being reported by watchdog termination tracking, (such as if the OS kills an app causing an app hang).

Because the app hang detection integration uses SentryCrashIntegration to capture the stack trace when creating app hang events,  SentryCrashIntegration has to be enabled for the integration to work. 

Starting with version 8.0.0, this feature has been enabled by default. To disable it:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    options.enableAppHangTracking = false
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    options.enableAppHangTracking = NO;
}];

```

You can change the timeout by changing the `appHangTimeoutInterval` option:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    options.appHangTimeoutInterval = 1
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    options.appHangTimeoutInterval = 1;
}];

```
