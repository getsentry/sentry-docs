This integration tracks out-of-memory (OOM) crashes based on heuristics. This feature is available for iOS, tvOS, and Mac Catalyst and works only if the application was in the foreground.

When your application uses too much RAM, the operating system kills your app without a normal termination process. Your process doesn't receive a signal or any other type of information to ensure an OOM occurred. As a result, in the Apple SDK, we track out-of-memory crashes during the app start based on heuristics. If your app runs in the background, we can't reliably detect OOMs and don't report them. If you're interested in the implementation details, you can check out [the code](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/blob/master/Sources/Sentry/SentryOutOfMemoryLogic.m) to find out more.

If you'd like to opt out of this feature, you can do so using options:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    options.enableOutOfMemoryTracking = false
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    options.enableOutOfMemoryTracking = NO;
}];

```
