Once enabled, this feature automatically captures HTTP client errors, like bad response codes, as error events and reports them to Sentry. The error event will contain the `request` and `response` data, such as `url`, `status_code`, and so on.

Since 8.0.0, this feature has been enabled by default. To disable it:

<SignInNote />

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    options.enableCaptureFailedRequests = false
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    options.enableCaptureFailedRequests = NO;
}];
```

By default, only HTTP client errors with a response code between `500` and `599` are captured as error events, but you can change this behavior by setting the `failedRequestStatusCodes` option:

<SignInNote />

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    let httpStatusCodeRange = HttpStatusCodeRange(min: 400, max: 599)
    options.failedRequestStatusCodes = [ httpStatusCodeRange ]
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    SentryHttpStatusCodeRange *httpStatusCodeRange =
            [[SentryHttpStatusCodeRange alloc] initWithMin:400 max:599];
    options.failedRequestStatusCodes = @[ httpStatusCodeRange ];
}];
```

HTTP client errors from every target (`.*` regular expression) are automatically captured, but you can change this behavior by setting the `failedRequestTargets` option with either a regular expression or a plain `String`. A plain string must contain at least one of the items from the list. Plain strings don't have to be full matches, meaning the URL of a request is matched when it contains a string provided through the option:

<SignInNote />

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    options.failedRequestTargets = [ "www.example.com" ]
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    options.failedRequestTargets = @[ @"www.example.com" ];
}];
```

Error events may contain PII data, such as `Headers` and `Cookies`. Sentry already does data scrubbing by default, but you can scrub any data before it is sent. Learn more in [Scrubbing Sensitive Data](/platforms/apple/guides/ios/data-management/sensitive-data/).

These events are searchable and you can set alerts on them if you use the `http.url` and `http.status_code` properties. Learn more in our full [Searchable Properties](/product/sentry-basics/search/searchable-properties/) documentation.

### Customize or Drop the Error Event

The captured error event can be customized or dropped with a `beforeSend`:

<SignInNote />

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    options.beforeSend = { event in
        // modify event here or return NULL to discard the event
        return event
    }
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    options.beforeSend = ^SentryEvent * _Nullable(SentryEvent * _Nonnull event) {
        // modify event here or return NULL to discard the event
        return event;
    }
}];
```
