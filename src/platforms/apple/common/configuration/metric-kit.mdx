<Include name="feature-stage-alpha.mdx" />

Once enabled, this feature subscribes to [MetricKit's](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metrickit) [MXDiagnosticPayload](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metrickit/mxdiagnosticpayload) data, converts it to events, and sends it to Sentry. This feature is available on Cocoa 8.0.0 and up.

The MetricKit integration subscribes to:

- [MXHangDiagnostic](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metrickit/mxhangdiagnostic)
- [MXDiskWriteExceptionDiagnostic](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metrickit/mxdiskwriteexceptiondiagnostic)
- [MXCPUExceptionDiagnostic](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metrickit/mxcpuexceptiondiagnostic)

The SDK supports this feature from iOS 15 and up and macOS 12 and up because in these versions, MetricKit delivers diagnostic reports immediately, which allows the Sentry SDK to apply current data from the scope.

This is an experimental feature requiring opt-in, and can be enabled by setting the `enableMetricKit` option to `true`:

<SignInNote />

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    options.enableMetricKit = true
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    options.enableMetricKit = YES;
}];
```
