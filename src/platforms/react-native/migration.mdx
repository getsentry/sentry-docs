## From 2.4.x to 2.5.x

The breaking changes are relevant only to Android. There are no breaking changes for other platforms.

### Android Specific Changes

Sentry React Native version `2.5.0` depends on Sentry Android `5.0.0`. Please [refer to the Android migration guide for Android-specific changes](/platforms/android/migration/#migrating-from-iosentrysentry-android-430-to-iosentrysentry-android-500).

`Settings.Secure.ANDROID_ID` has been removed and replaced with a randomly-generated `installationId`. This may affect the number of unique users displayed on the the Issues page and Alerts. If you always set a custom user using `Sentry.setUser(customUser)`, the behavior has not changed. While you don't have to make any update, if you want to maintain the old behavior, use the following code snippet which makes use of the [react-native-device-info](https://github.com/react-native-device-info/react-native-device-info) library.

```javascript
import { Platform } from "react-native";
import DeviceInfo from "react-native-device-info";

import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react-native";

Sentry.init({
  // ...
});

// Only add the event processor on Android
if (Platform.OS === "android") {
  Sentry.addGlobalEventProcessor(event => {
    // Get the ANDROID_ID
    const id = DeviceInfo.getUniqueId();

    // If the user does not exist, set the id to be the unique id.
    if (!event.user) {
      event.user = { id };
    }

    return event;
  });
}
```

## React Navigation Instrumentation from <2.3.0

We changed the initialization method for the React Navigation V5 routing instrumentation to avoid a potential issue when using linking. You now register the navigation container inside the `onReady` prop passed to the `NavigationContainer`.

From:

```javascript
// Old Functional Component Example
const App = () => {
  const navigation = React.useRef();

  React.useEffect(() => {
    routingInstrumentation.registerNavigationContainer(navigation);
  }, []);

  return <NavigationContainer ref={navigation}>...</NavigationContainer>;
};

// Old Class Component Example
class App extends React.Component {
  navigation = React.createRef();

  componentDidMount() {
    routingInstrumentation.registerNavigationContainer(navigation);
  }

  render() {
    return <NavigationContainer ref={this.navigation}>...</NavigationContainer>;
  }
}
```

To:

```javascript
// Functional Component Example
const App = () => {
  const navigation = React.useRef();

  return (
    <NavigationContainer
      ref={navigation}
      onReady={() => {
        // Register the navigation container with the instrumentation inside onReady
        routingInstrumentation.registerNavigationContainer(navigation);
      }}
    >
      ...
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
};

// Class Component Example
class App extends React.Component {
  navigation = React.createRef();

  render() {
    return (
      <NavigationContainer
        ref={this.navigation}
        onReady={() => {
          // Register the navigation container with the instrumentation inside onReady
          routingInstrumentation.registerNavigationContainer(navigation);
        }}
      >
        ...
      </NavigationContainer>
    );
  }
}
```

## From 1.x to 2.x

Sentry's most recent version of our React Native SDK enables release health tracking and native stack traces by default.

This version of the SDK uses the [envelope endpoint](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/envelopes/). If you are using self-hosted Sentry, the SDK requires Sentry version 20.6.0 and above. If you are using our SaaS product ([sentry.io](https://sentry.io)), no changes or actions needed.

### iOS/MacOS

While the migration does not introduce breaking changes for iOS/MacOS on the React Native side, we recommend running `pod install` after the upgrade.

<Note>

If you are using our Cocoa SDK directly, follow that [migration guide for 5.x to 6.x](/platforms/apple/migration/#migrating-from-5x-to-6x).

</Note>

On iOS/MacOS, we now cache events in envelopes on the disk. As a result, you might lose a few cached events during the migration. Due to the effort involved, the migration from 5.x to 6.x does not move these few cached events into envelopes.

### Android

If you are on React Native <0.60, you will need to update this line in your `MainApplication.java`:

From (earlier version):

```java
import io.sentry.RNSentryPackage;
```

```kotlin
import io.sentry.RNSentryPackage
```

New:

```java
import io.sentry.react.RNSentryPackage;
```

```kotlin
import io.sentry.react.RNSentryPackage
```

Other than the one line change noted above, the migration should not cause breaking changes on the React Native side.

<Note>

If you use our Android SDK directly, you should follow its [migration guide for 2.x to 3.x](/platforms/android/migration/#migrating-from-iosentrysentry-android-2x-to-iosentrysentry-android-3x).

</markdown>
</Note>

## From 0.x to 1.x

If you are upgrading from an earlier version of Sentry's React Native SDK, you should unlink the package to ensure the generated code is updated to the latest version:

```bash
react-native unlink react-native-sentry
```

After that remove `react-native-sentry` from your `package.json`:

```bash
npm uninstall react-native-sentry --save
# or
yarn remove react-native-sentry
```

From there you can follow the standard installation instructions for `@sentry/react-native`.
