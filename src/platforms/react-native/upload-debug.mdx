Debug symbols provide information that Sentry displays on the **Issue Details** page to help you triage an issue. We offer a range of methods to provide Sentry with debug symbols.

## When to Upload

With default settings, complete stack traces are available in your Java/Kotlin error, out of the box, unless you use [enableProguardInReleaseBuilds](https://reactnative.dev/docs/signed-apk-android#enabling-proguard-to-reduce-the-size-of-the-apk-optional). In this case, you need to upload the ProGuard/R8 mapping file generated by the [Android Gradle Plugin](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code#shrink-code), so Sentry can show you proper stack traces.

Errors raised from the native layer in Android apps require certain debug information files to be uploaded. For example, an Android app with [NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk/) support, dwarf debug files need to be uploaded.

## Uploading With Sentry Gradle Plugin

Upload the [Android ProGuard/R8 mapping files and native symbols](/platforms/android/proguard/) by the recommended method of using our Gradle integration.

## Uploading With sentry-cli

Upload the [Android ProGuard/R8 mapping files and native symbols](/platforms/android/proguard/) manually by using `sentry-cli` [upload-proguard](/product/cli/dif/#proguard-mapping-upload) or [upload-dif](/product/cli/dif/#uploading-files).
