Debug symbols provide information that Sentry displays on the **Issue Details** page to help you triage an issue. We offer a range of methods to provide Sentry with debug symbols.

## When to Upload

With default settings, complete stack traces are available in your Java/Kotlin error, out of the box, unless you use [enableProguardInReleaseBuilds](https://reactnative.dev/docs/signed-apk-android#enabling-proguard-to-reduce-the-size-of-the-apk-optional). In this case, you need to upload the ProGuard/R8 mapping file generated by the [Android Gradle Plugin](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code#shrink-code), so Sentry can show you proper stack traces.

Errors raised from the native layer in Android apps require certain debug information files to be uploaded. For example, an Android app can use `proguard` for minification and obfuscation. Also, when using [NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk/), dwarf debug files need to be uploaded.

## Uploading With ProGuard and NDK

To use ProGuard or NDK with Sentry, upload the [Android Proguard/R8 mapping files and native symbols](/platforms/android/proguard/) by either the recommended method of using our Gradle integration or manually by using `sentry-cli` [upload-proguard](/product/cli/dif/#proguard-mapping-upload) or [upload-dif](/product/cli/dif/#uploading-files).
