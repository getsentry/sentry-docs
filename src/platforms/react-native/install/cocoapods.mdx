To use Sentry with CocoaPods, install the packages with `npm` or `yarn` and link them locally in your `Podfile`.

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install --save react react-native @sentry/react-native
```

```bash {tabTitle:Yarn}
yarn add react react-native @sentry/react-native
```

After that, change your `Podfile` to reference to the packages in your `node_modules` folder. For the latest reference on how to use react-native with CocoaPods see: [Integration with existing apps](https://reactnative.dev/docs/integration-with-existing-apps#configuring-cocoapods-dependencies)

```ruby
target 'YOUR-TARGET' do
  # Your react-native and other pods

  pod 'RNSentry', :podspec => '../node_modules/@sentry/react-native/RNSentry.podspec' # or your path to node_modules
end
```

Last, run `pod install` which should link everything correctly. Please keep in mind that you need the build steps that upload your source maps and debug symbols.
