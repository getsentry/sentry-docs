The Sentry React Native SDK will automatically add information onto your event to make it easier to debug and understand your app.

## Event Origin and Environment Tags

The event origin tag tells you which layer of your app the event originated from.

The possible values for `event.origin` are:

- `javascript`
- `android`
- `ios`

The event environment tag tells you which environment the event originated from.

The possible values for `event.environment` are:

- `javascript`
- `java`
- `native`

For example, if a native crash happens when your app is running on iOS, the event could be tagged with `event.origin: ios` and `event.environment: native`.
