Sentry added support for `react-native` builds that use the `hermes` engine, which required changes to the sentry SDK, `sentry-cli` as well as Sentry itself.

Sentry customers using the SaaS product (sentry.io) will need to update the SDK, and `sentry-cli`.
The minimum required version for the SDK is `@sentry/react-native` [SDK version `1.3.3`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-react-native/releases/tag/1.3.3),
and `@sentry/cli` [version `1.51.1`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cli/releases/tag/1.51.1).

For Sentry open source, self-hosted users, the minimum version required is [f07352b](https://hub.docker.com/r/getsentry/sentry/tags?page=1&name=f07352b).

Once you have the minimum version of the SDK, Sentry provides the standard integration as described in the [React Native Sentry documentation](/platforms/react-native/).

<Note>

If you are using Hermes, you should not have the [RAM bundles](/platforms/react-native/manual-setup/ram-bundles/) feature enabled. In Hermes, when loading the bytecode, `mmap` ensures that the entire file is not loaded. Using Hermes with RAM bundles might lead to issues, because those mechanisms are not compatible with each other.

</Note>

## Source Maps

If you do not need custom sourcemaps, the `sentry.gradle` build step fully supports Hermes source maps.

## Custom Source Maps

If you are manually bundling and building React Native apps, follow this three-step process.

### Compile Sourcemaps

1. Bundle/minify with `metro` (`react-native`) to get the bundle (`.bundle`) and packager source map (`.packager.map`):

```bash {tabTitle:Android}
npx react-native bundle --platform android --dev false --entry-file index.js --reset-cache --bundle-output index.android.bundle --sourcemap-output index.android.bundle.packager.map --minify false
```

```bash {tabTitle:iOS}
npx react-native bundle --platform ios --dev false --entry-file index.js --reset-cache --bundle-output main.jsbundle --sourcemap-output main.jsbundle.packager.map --minify false
```

2. Compile to bytecode using `hermes` to get the compiler source map (`.hbc.map`):

<Note>

`OS-BIN` is `osx-bin`, `win64-bin`, or `linux64-bin`, depending on which operating system you are using.

</Note>

```bash {tabTitle:Android}
node_modules/hermes-engine/{OS-BIN}/hermesc -O -emit-binary -output-source-map -out=index.android.bundle.hbc index.android.bundle
```

```bash {tabTitle:iOS}
node_modules/hermes-engine/{OS-BIN}/hermesc -O -emit-binary -output-source-map -out=main.jsbundle.hbc main.jsbundle
```

<Note>

If you're using React Native v0.69 or higher, the path of `hermesc` has changed to `node_modules/react-native/sdks/hermesc/{OS-BIN}/hermesc`.

</Note>

3. Merge the two source maps using `compose-source-maps` to get the final source map (`.map`):

```bash {tabTitle:Android}
node node_modules/react-native/scripts/compose-source-maps.js index.android.bundle.packager.map index.android.bundle.hbc.map -o index.android.bundle.map
```

```bash {tabTitle:iOS}
node node_modules/react-native/scripts/compose-source-maps.js main.jsbundle.packager.map main.jsbundle.hbc.map -o main.jsbundle.map
```

### Upload the Bundle and Source Maps

Upload your source maps following [Step 3 on the normal source maps guide](/platforms/react-native/sourcemaps/#3-upload-the-bundle-and-source-maps).

<Note>

You will upload the **original** bundle (`.bundle`, output from Step 1) and the **composed** source map (`.map`, output from Step 3)
