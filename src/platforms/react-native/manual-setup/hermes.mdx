Sentry added support for `react-native` builds that use the `hermes` engine, which required changes to the sentry SDK, `sentry-cli` as well as Sentry itself.

Sentry customers using the SaaS product (sentry.io) will need to update the SDK, and `sentry-cli`.
The minimum required version for the SDK is `@sentry/react-native` [SDK version `1.3.3`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-react-native/releases/tag/1.3.3),
and `@sentry/cli` [version `1.51.1`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cli/releases/tag/1.51.1).

For Sentry open source, self-hosted users, the minimum version required is [f07352b](https://hub.docker.com/r/getsentry/sentry/tags?page=1&name=f07352b).

Once you have the minimum version of the SDK, Sentry provides the standard integration as described in the [React Native Sentry documentation](/platforms/react-native/).

## Source Maps

If you do not need custom sourcemaps, the `sentry.gradle` build step fully supports Hermes source maps.

## Custom Source Maps

If you are manually bundling and building React Native apps for Android, follow this three-step process. For Hermes on iOS, follow the [normal source maps guide](/platforms/react-native/sourcemaps/).

### Compile for Android

1. Bundle/minify with `metro` (`react-native`) to get the packager source map (`.packager.map`):

```bash {tabTitle:Android}
npx react-native bundle --platform android --dev false --entry-file index.js --bundle-output index.android.bundle --sourcemap-output index.android.bundle.packager.map
```

2. Compile to bytecode using `hermes` to get the compiler source map (`.hbc.map`):

 <Note>
 
 `OS-BIN` is `osx-bin`, `win64-bin`, or `linux64-bin`, depending on which operating system you are using.
 
 </Note>

```bash {tabTitle:Android}
node_modules/hermes-engine/{OS-BIN}/hermesc -O -emit-binary -output-source-map -out=index.android.bundle.hbc index.android.bundle
```

3. Merge the two source maps using `compose-source-maps` to get the final source map (`.map`):

```bash {tabTitle:Android}
node node_modules/react-native/scripts/compose-source-maps.js index.android.bundle.packager.map index.android.bundle.hbc.map -o index.android.bundle.map
```

### Upload the Bundle and Source Maps

Upload your source maps following [Step 3 on the normal source maps guide](/platforms/react-native/sourcemaps/#3-upload-the-bundle-and-source-maps).
