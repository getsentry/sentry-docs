To use Sentry together with CodePush, pass `release` and `dist` to `Sentry.init`. Our suggestion is to store them in an `app.json`, or you can just use the `package.json`. These values need to be unique to each version of your codebase and match the version on the source maps exactly, or they might not be symbolicated.

When you set a custom `release` and `dist`, or manually upload source maps, you will need to disable the automatic source map upload script. Learn more in the [Disable the automatic source maps upload script](/platforms/react-native/sourcemaps/#2-disable-the-automatic-source-maps-upload-script) documentation.

For more information on the `release` and `dist` parameters, check out the section on [Source Maps](/platforms/react-native/sourcemaps/).

We recommend using the format `${BUNDLE_ID}@${APP_VERSION}+codepush:${DIST}` for release names.

```javascript
import { release, dist } from "app.json";

Sentry.init({
  // ...
  release,
  dist,
});
```

If you need to use `codePush.getUpdateMetadata`, you will have to wait to initialize the Sentry SDK until the Promise is resolved.

<Note>

This method is not recommended as any errors or crashes that happen before the initialization of the Sentry SDK will not be caught.

</Note>

```javascript
import codePush from "react-native-code-push";

codePush.getUpdateMetadata().then((update) => {
  if (update) {
    Sentry.init({
      // ...
      release: `${update.appVersion}+codepush:${update.label}`,
      dist: update.label,
    });
  }
});
```

If you're wrapping your root component with `Sentry.wrap` to access Performance features, `codePush` should be the outer most function because it needs access to the root component in order to swap out the bundle.

```javascript
export default codePush(Sentry.wrap(App));
```

## Making Releases

After updating your CodePush release, you have to upload the new assets to Sentry:

When making the release with CodePush, make sure to output the bundle and source maps by specifying `--sourcemap-output` and `--output-dir ./build`. This will output to the `./build/CodePush` folder.

```bash
appcenter codepush release-react -a {APP} -d {DEPLOYMENT} --sourcemap-output --output-dir ./build
```

Exporting the `SENTRY_PROPERTIES` will tell sentry-cli to use the properties in your project. The sentry-wizard install step should have generated this file for you. Alternatively, you can either pass it via parameters or a global settings file. To find more about this refer to [Working with Projects](/product/cli/configuration/#sentry-cli-working-with-projects).

```bash
export SENTRY_PROPERTIES=./ios/sentry.properties
```

Upload the outputted bundle and source maps to Sentry.
If you use custom deployment names in CodePush, you will need to use `--deployment` to specify the deployment.

```bash
sentry-cli react-native appcenter {APP} ios ./build/CodePush --deployment {DEPLOYMENT} --dist {DIST}
```

For non-macOS devices building for iOS, you will need to pass extra parameters that can't be computed automatically (`--bundle-id` and `--version-name`).
Within your `Info.plist`, `--version-name` corresponds to `CFBundleShortVersionString` .

On iOS:

```bash
sentry-cli react-native appcenter {APP} ios ./build/CodePush --deployment {DEPLOYMENT} --dist {DIST} --bundle-id {BUNDLE_ID} --version-name {VERSION_NAME}
```

If you don't want to use the automatically computed release format, instead of passing `--bundle-id` and `--version-name`, you'll need to pass the `--release-name` parameter.

```bash
sentry-cli react-native appcenter {APP} ios ./build/CodePush --deployment {DEPLOYMENT} --dist {DIST} --release-name {RELEASE_NAME}
```

<Alert level="info">

Make sure to export the `APPCENTER_ACCESS_TOKEN` in your environment in order to run the `appcenter` commands above. Otherwise you will get the following error:

```bash
Command 'appcenter codepush deployment history' requires a logged in user. Use the 'appcenter login' command to log in.
```

You can find more information about this in the [AppCenter CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/cli/#logging-in) documentation.

</Alert>

If you still have issues with CodePush source maps, you can refer to [Source Maps for Other Platforms](/platforms/react-native/sourcemaps/) to manually bundle and upload source maps to Sentry.
