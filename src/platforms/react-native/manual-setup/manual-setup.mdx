If you can’t (or prefer not to) run the [automatic setup](/platforms/react-native), use the instructions below to configure your application.

<Alert level="info" title="Prerequisite">

Before you can begin, you need to created a `sentry.properties` file at the root of your React Native _android_ and _ios_ project directories. Check out these examples of property files for [iOS](https://github.com/getsentry/examples/blob/master/react-native/AwesomeProject/ios/sentry.properties) and [Android](https://github.com/getsentry/examples/blob/master/react-native/AwesomeProject/android/sentry.properties).

</Alert>

## iOS

### Linking the Native Library via CocoaPods

To link the Native library via CocoaPods, link to the Native module in your Podfile. In React Native versions 0.60 and above, the podspec should be automatically linked, if that's not the case, you can link to the native module manually by adding the `RNSentry.podspec` to your Podfile. See below:

```rb
pod 'RNSentry', :path => '../node_modules/@sentry/react-native/RNSentry.podspec'
```

### Upload Debug Symbols

[Debug symbols](/platforms/native/data-management/debug-files/) help provide you with readable stack traces, which Sentry displays on the **Issue Details** page, to help you triage an issue. With our React Native SDK, debug symbols are used to symbolicate Native layer (iOS/Android) events. When you use Xcode, you can hook directly into the build process to upload debug symbols. When linking, one build phase script is changed and two more are added.

#### Bundle React Native Code and Images

We modify the React Native build phase (“Bundle React Native code and images”) slightly from this:

```bash
set -e

WITH_ENVIRONMENT="../node_modules/react-native/scripts/xcode/with-environment.sh"
REACT_NATIVE_XCODE="../node_modules/react-native/scripts/react-native-xcode.sh"

/bin/sh -c "$WITH_ENVIRONMENT $REACT_NATIVE_XCODE"
```

To this:

```bash
export SENTRY_PROPERTIES=sentry.properties
export EXTRA_PACKAGER_ARGS="--sourcemap-output $DERIVED_FILE_DIR/main.jsbundle.map"
set -e

# RN 0.69+
WITH_ENVIRONMENT="../node_modules/react-native/scripts/xcode/with-environment.sh"
REACT_NATIVE_XCODE="../node_modules/react-native/scripts/react-native-xcode.sh"
SENTRY_CLI="../node_modules/@sentry/cli/bin/sentry-cli"

/bin/sh -c "$WITH_ENVIRONMENT \"$SENTRY_CLI react-native xcode $REACT_NATIVE_XCODE\""

# RN 0.46 – 0.68
# ../node_modules/@sentry/cli/bin/sentry-cli react-native xcode \
#  ../node_modules/react-native/scripts/react-native-xcode.sh

# All versions
/bin/sh ../node_modules/@sentry/react-native/scripts/collect-modules.sh
```

Additionally, we add a build script named “Upload Debug Symbols to Sentry” to upload debug symbols to Sentry.

#### Upload Debug Symbols to Sentry

To upload source maps and symbols to Sentry, create a new Run Script build phase using the following script:

```bash
export SENTRY_PROPERTIES=sentry.properties

[[ $SENTRY_INCLUDE_NATIVE_SOURCES == "true" ]] && INCLUDE_SOURCES_FLAG="--include-sources" || INCLUDE_SOURCES_FLAG=""
SENTRY_CLI="../node_modules/@sentry/cli/bin/sentry-cli"
$SENTRY_CLI debug-files upload "$INCLUDE_SOURCES_FLAG" "$DWARF_DSYM_FOLDER_PATH"
```

By default, uploading of debug simulator builds is disabled for speed reasons. If you want to generate debug symbols for debug builds, you can pass `--allow-fetch` as a parameter to `react-native-xcode` in the above mentioned build phase.

For more information visit [Sentry CLI Apple Debug Symbols](/platforms/apple/dsym/#sentry-cli) documentation.

### Using node with nvm or Volta

If you are using nvm or notion, Xcode has trouble locating the default node binary, which can look similar to the [troubleshooting example](/platforms/react-native/troubleshooting/#using-node-with-nvm-or-volta).

## Android

For Android, we hook into Gradle for the source map build process. When you run `npx @sentry/wizard -i reactNative -p ios android`, the Gradle files are automatically updated. If you can't or don't want to do that, you can follow the steps below to update the files.

### Enable Gradle Integration

We enable the Gradle integration in your `android/app/build.gradle` file by adding the following line before the `android` options:

```groovy {filename:android/app/build.gradle}
apply from: "../../node_modules/@sentry/react-native/sentry.gradle"
```

### Enable Sentry AGP

You can enable native symbol upload and other features by adding [Sentry Android Gradle Plugin (SAGP)](/platforms/android/configuration/gradle) to `android/app/build.gradle`.

```groovy {filename:android/app/build.gradle}
apply plugin: "io.sentry.android.gradle"

sentry {
    // Enables or disables the automatic configuration of Native Symbols
    // for Sentry. This executes sentry-cli automatically so
    // you don't need to do it manually.
    // Default is disabled.
    uploadNativeSymbols = true

    // Enables or disables the automatic upload of the app's native source code to Sentry.
    // This executes sentry-cli with the --include-sources param automatically so
    // you don't need to do it manually.
    // This option has an effect only when [uploadNativeSymbols] is enabled.
    // Default is disabled.
    includeNativeSources = true
}
```

### Enable Logging for `sentry-cli`

You can also enable logging for `sentry-cli` by adding this config before the above `apply from:` line:

```groovy {filename:android/app/build.gradle}
project.ext.sentryCli = [
    logLevel: "debug"
]

apply from: "../../node_modules/@sentry/react-native/sentry.gradle"
```

### Fetch `sentry.properties`

We also support fetching different `sentry.properties` files for different flavors. For that, you need to add:

```groovy {filename:android/app/build.gradle}
project.ext.sentryCli = [
    logLevel: "debug",
    flavorAware: true
]

apply from: "../../node_modules/@sentry/react-native/sentry.gradle"
```

The corresponding flavor files should also be placed within the specific build type folder where you intend to use them. For example, the "Android demo release" flavor would be `react-native/android/sentry-demo-release.properties`.

We recommend leaving `logLevel: "debug"` since we look for specific `sentry.properties` files depending on your flavor's name.

Include the project by adding it to your dependency list in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy {filename:android/app/build.gradle}
dependencies {
    // ... other dependencies listed here //
    implementation project(':@sentry_react-native')
}
```

If you're linking manually, make sure your `MainApplication.java` is similar to:

```java
import io.sentry.react.RNSentryPackage;

public class MainApplication extends Application implements ReactApplication {

    @Override
    protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
      List<ReactPackage> packages = new PackageList(this).getPackages();
      packages.add(new RNSentryPackage());
      return packages;
    }
}
```

```kotlin
import io.sentry.react.RNSentryPackage

class MainApplication() : Application(), ReactApplication {
  override fun getPackages():List<ReactPackage> {
    val packages = new PackageList(this).getPackages();
    packages.add(new RNSentryPackage());
    return packages;
  }
}
```

Add the following to your `settings.gradle` file:

```groovy {filename:android/settings.gradle}
include ':@sentry_react-native'
project(':@sentry_react-native').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/@sentry/react-native/android')
```
