If you can’t (or prefer not to) run the [linking step](/platforms/react-native/#linking), you can use the instructions below to configure your application.

<Alert level="info" title="Prerequisite">

Before you begin, you need to have already created a `sentry.properties` file at the root of your React Native project. An example of this properties file can be found in
[Sentry's GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/examples/blob/master/react-native/sentry.properties).

</Alert>

## iOS

### Linking the Native Library via CocoaPods

You must link to the native module in your Podfile. In React Native versions 0.60 and above the podspec should be automatically linked. In earlier versions calling `react-native link @sentry/react-native` will add the podspec for you.

Otherwise, you can manually link the native module by adding the `RNSentry.podspec` to your podfile like below:

```rb
pod 'RNSentry', :path => '../node_modules/@sentry/react-native/RNSentry.podspec'
```

### Upload Debug Symbols

[Debug symbols](/platforms/native/data-management/debug-files/) help provide you with readable stack traces, which Sentry displays on the **Issue Details** page, to help you triage an issue. With our React Native SDK, debug symbols are used to symbolicate Native layer (iOS/Android) events. When you use Xcode, you can hook directly into the build process to upload debug symbols. When linking, one build phase script is changed and two more are added.

#### Bundle React Native Code and Images

We modify the React Native build phase (“Bundle React Native code and images”) slightly from this:

```bash
export NODE_BINARY=node
../node_modules/react-native/packager/react-native-xcode.sh
```

To this:

```bash
export NODE_BINARY=node
export EXTRA_PACKAGER_ARGS="--sourcemap-output $DERIVED_FILE_DIR/main.jsbundle.map"
export SENTRY_PROPERTIES=../sentry.properties

# If you are using RN 0.46+
../node_modules/@sentry/cli/bin/sentry-cli react-native xcode \
  ../node_modules/react-native/scripts/react-native-xcode.sh

# For RN < 0.46
../node_modules/@sentry/cli/bin/sentry-cli react-native xcode \
  ../node_modules/react-native/packager/react-native-xcode.sh
```

Additionally, we add a build script named “Upload Debug Symbols to Sentry” to upload debug symbols to Sentry.

#### Upload Debug Symbols to Sentry

To upload source maps and symbols to Sentry, create a new Run Script build phase using the following script:

```bash
export SENTRY_PROPERTIES=../sentry.properties

../node_modules/@sentry/cli/bin/sentry-cli upload-dif "$DWARF_DSYM_FOLDER_PATH"
```

For bitcode enabled builds via iTunes Connect, additional steps are required.
Follow the instructions in [Sentry's bitcode documentation](/clients/cocoa/dsym/#dsym-with-bitcode) to set up uploads of symbols for all build variants.

By default, uploading of debug simulator builds is disabled for speed reasons. If you want to generate debug symbols for debug builds, you can pass `--allow-fetch` as a parameter to `react-native-xcode` in the above mentioned build phase.

### Using node with nvm or Volta

If you are using nvm or notion, Xcode has trouble locating the default node binary, which can look similar to the [troubleshooting example](/platforms/react-native/troubleshooting/#using-node-with-nvm-or-volta).

## Android

For Android, we hook into Gradle for the source map build process. When you run `react-native link` or `yarn sentry-wizard -i reactNative -p ios android` (if react-native `> 0.60`), the Gradle files are automatically updated.

### Enable Gradle Integration

We enable the Gradle integration in your `android/app/build.gradle` file by adding the following line after the `react.gradle` line:

```groovy {filename:android/app/build.gradle}
apply from: "../../node_modules/@sentry/react-native/sentry.gradle"
```

### Enable Logging for `sentry-cli`

You can also enable logging for `sentry-cli` by adding this config before the above `apply from:` line:

```groovy {filename:android/app/build.gradle}
project.ext.sentryCli = [
    logLevel: "debug"
]
```

### Fetch `sentry.properties`

We also support fetching different `sentry.properties` files for different flavors. For that, you need to add:

```groovy {filename:android/app/build.gradle}
project.ext.sentryCli = [
    logLevel: "debug",
    flavorAware: true
]
```

The corresponding flavor files should also be placed within the specific build type folder where you intend to use them. For example, the "Android release" flavor would be `react-native/android/sentry-release.properties`.

We recommend leaving `logLevel: "debug"` since we look for specific `sentry.properties` files depending on your flavor's name.

Include the project by adding it to your dependency list in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy {filename:android/app/build.gradle}
dependencies {
    // ... other dependencies listed here //
    implementation project(':@sentry_react-native')
}
```

### `MainApplication.java` for React Native < 0.60

For React Native versions < 0.60, make sure your `MainApplication.java` is similar to:

```java
import io.sentry.react.RNSentryPackage;

public class MainApplication extends Application implements ReactApplication {

  @Override
  protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
    return Arrays.<ReactPackage>asList(
         new MainReactPackage(),
         new RNSentryPackage()
    );
  }
}
```

```kotlin
import io.sentry.react.RNSentryPackage

class MainApplication() : Application(), ReactApplication {
  override fun getPackages(): List<ReactPackage> {
    return listOf(
      MainReactPackage(),
      RNSentryPackage()
    )
  }
}
```

Add the following to your `settings.gradle` file:

```groovy {filename:android/settings.gradle}
include ':@sentry_react-native'
project(':@sentry_react-native').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/@sentry/react-native/android')
```
