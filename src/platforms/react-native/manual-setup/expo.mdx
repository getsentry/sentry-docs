<Alert level="info" title="Experimental Support">

Expo support is currently experimental and available since Sentry React Native SDK version `5.16.0-alpha.4` and Expo SDK version 50.

Experimental support means it may have bugs. We recognize the irony.

</Alert>

To set up the Sentry React Native SDK in your Expo project, follow the steps on this page.

### Install the Sentry SDK

Install the `@sentry/react-native` package:

```bash {tabTitle:Expo}
npx expo install @sentry/react-native
```

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install --save @sentry/react-native
```

```bash {tabTitle:Yarn}
yarn add @sentry/react-native
```

### Intialize the SDK

Import the `@sentry/react-native` package and call `init` with your DSN:

```javascript {tabTitle:App.js or app/_layout.js}
import { Text, View } from "react-native";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react-native";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___DSN___",

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for performance monitoring.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

function App() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Expo Example!</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

export default Sentry.wrap(App);
```

### Wrap Your App

Wrap the root component of your application with `Sentry.wrap`:

```javascript {tabTitle:App.js or app/_layout.js}
export default Sentry.wrap(App);
```

### Add the Sentry Expo Plugin

To ensure the bundles and source maps are automatically uploaded during the native applications builds, add `withSentry` to the Expo application configuration:

```javascript {tabTitle:app.json/app.config.json}
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "@sentry/react-native/expo",
        {
          "url": "https://sentry.io/",
          "warning": "DO NOT COMMIT YOUR AUTH TOKEN",
          "authToken": "___ORG_AUTH_TOKEN___",
          "project": "___PROJECT_SLUG___",
          "organization": "___ORG_SLUG___"
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

```javascript {tabTitle:app.config.js}
const { withSentry } = require("@sentry/react-native/expo");

const config = {
  name: "Expo Example",
  slug: "expo-example",
};

module.exports = withSentry(config, {
  url: "https://sentry.io/",
  // DO NOT COMMIT YOUR AUTH TOKEN
  authToken: "___ORG_AUTH_TOKEN___",
  project: "___PROJECT_SLUG___s",
  organization: "___ORG_SLUG___",
});
```

```typescript {tabTitle:app.config.ts}
import { ExpoConfig } from "expo/config";
import { withSentry } from "@sentry/react-native/expo";

const config: ExpoConfig = {
  name: "Expo Example",
  slug: "expo-example",
};

export default withSentry(config, {
  url: "https://sentry.io/",
  // DO NOT COMMIT YOUR AUTH TOKEN
  authToken: "___ORG_AUTH_TOKEN___",
  project: "___PROJECT_SLUG___s",
  organization: "___ORG_SLUG___",
});
```

### Add Sentry Metro Plugin

To ensure unique Debug IDs get assigned to the generated bundles and source maps, add Sentry Serializer to the Metro configuration:

```javascript {tabTitle:metro.config.js}
// const { getDefaultConfig } = require("expo/metro-config");
const { getSentryExpoConfig } = require("@sentry/react-native/metro");

// const config = getDefaultConfig(__dirname);
const config = getSentryExpoConfig(__dirname);

module.exports = config;
```

## Verify Setup

To verify that everything is working as expected, build the `Release` version of your application and send a test event to Sentry by adding:

```javascript
<Button
  title="Try!"
  onPress={() => {
    Sentry.captureException(new Error("First error"));
  }}
/>
```

## Notes

- To avoid commiting your auth token, you can use `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable.
- Source maps for the `Release` version of your application are uploaded automatically during the native application build.
- During development the source code is resolved using the Metro Server and source maps are not used. This currently does't work on Web.
