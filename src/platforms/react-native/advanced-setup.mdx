If you can’t (or don’t want to) run the linking step, you can use the instructions below to configure your application.

## General

You will want to make sure you have already created a `sentry.properties` file at the root of your react native project. An example of this properties file can be found in
[Sentry's GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/examples/blob/master/react-native/sentry.properties).

## iOS

### Linking the Native Library

You must link the native Sentry project with your project. This can be done by following the [Linking Libraries](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/linking-libraries-ios.html) steps described in React Native documentation.

The library you need to link is `node_modules/@sentry/react-native/ios/RNSentry.xcodeproj`.

### Build Steps

When you use Xcode, you can hook directly into the build process to upload debug symbols. When linking one build phase script is changed, and two more are added.

#### Bundle React Native code and images

We modify the React Native build phase (“Bundle React Native code and images”) slightly from this:

```bash
export NODE_BINARY=node
../node_modules/react-native/packager/react-native-xcode.sh
```

To this:

```bash
export NODE_BINARY=node
export EXTRA_PACKAGER_ARGS="--sourcemap-output $DERIVED_FILE_DIR/main.jsbundle.map"
export SENTRY_PROPERTIES=../sentry.properties

# If you are using RN 0.46+
../node_modules/@sentry/cli/bin/sentry-cli react-native xcode \
  ../node_modules/react-native/scripts/react-native-xcode.sh

# For RN < 0.46
../node_modules/@sentry/cli/bin/sentry-cli react-native xcode \
  ../node_modules/react-native/packager/react-native-xcode.sh
```

Additionally, we add a build script called “Upload Debug Symbols to Sentry” which uploads debug symbols to Sentry.

#### Upload Debug Symbols to Sentry

If you wish to upload the source maps and symbols to Sentry, create a new Run Script build phase with the following script:

```bash
export SENTRY_PROPERTIES=../sentry.properties

../node_modules/@sentry/cli/bin/sentry-cli upload-dif "$DWARF_DSYM_FOLDER_PATH"
```

For bitcode enabled builds via iTunes Connect, additional steps are required.
Follow the instructions in [Sentry's bitcode documentation](/clients/cocoa/dsym/#dsym-with-bitcode) to set up uploads of
symbols for all build variants.

By default, uploading of debug simulator builds is disabled for speed reasons. If you want to generate debug symbols for debug builds, you can pass `--allow-fetch` as a parameter to `react-native-xcode` in the above mentioned build phase.

### Using node with nvm or volta

If you are using nvm or notion, Xcode seems to have problems locating the default node binary. In this case, you should change the scripts:

Build failure in Xcode looks something like:

```bash
dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/opt/icu4c/lib/libicui18n.62.dylib
  Referenced from: /usr/local/bin/node
  Reason: image not found
```

You can simply run `ln -s $(which node) /usr/local/bin/node` which tells your env to use your node binary.

## Android

For Android, we hook into Gradle for the source map build process. When you run `react-native link` or `yarn sentry-wizard -i reactNative -p ios android` (if react-native `> 0.60`), the Gradle files are automatically updated.

We enable the Gradle integration in your `android/app/build.gradle` file by adding the following line after the `react.gradle` one:

```groovy {filename:android/app/build.gradle}
apply from: "../../node_modules/@sentry/react-native/sentry.gradle"
```

You can also enable logging for `sentry-cli` by adding this config before the above `apply from:` line:

```groovy {filename:android/app/build.gradle}
project.ext.sentryCli = [
    logLevel: "debug"
]
```

We also support fetching different `sentry.properties` files for different flavors. For that, you need to add:

```groovy {filename:android/app/build.gradle}
project.ext.sentryCli = [
    logLevel: "debug",
    flavorAware: true
]
```

The corresponding flavor files should also be placed within the specific build type folder you intend to use them. For example, the "Android release" flavor would be `react-native/android/sentry-release.properties`.

We recommend leaving `logLevel: "debug"` since we look for specific `sentry.properties` files depending on your flavor's name.

Include the project by adding it to your dependency list in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```groovy {filename:android/app/build.gradle}
dependencies {
    // ... other dependencies listed here //
    implementation project(':@sentry_react-native')
}
```

Please make sure your `MainApplication.java` looks something like this (only necessary for react-native versions `< 0.60`):

```java
import io.sentry.react.RNSentryPackage;

public class MainApplication extends Application implements ReactApplication {

    @Override
    protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
        return Arrays.<ReactPackage>asList(
                new MainReactPackage(),
                new RNSentryPackage()
        );
    }

}
```

Add the following to your `settings.gradle` file:

```groovy {filename:android/settings.gradle}
include ':@sentry_react-native'
project(':@sentry_react-native').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/@sentry/react-native/android')
```
