Use version `1.5.0` or later to track touch events with Sentry's React Native SDK. You will also need to wrap your app with a `TouchEventBoundary`.

## Wrapping with `TouchEventBoundary`

At the root of your app, usually `App.js`, wrap the app component with `Sentry.TouchEventBoundary`:

```javascript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react-native';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Sentry.TouchEventBoundary>
      <RestOfTheApp />
    </Sentry.TouchEventBoundary>
  );
};

export default AppRegistry.registerComponent('Your Amazing App', () => App);
```

## Using the `withTouchEventBoundary` Higher-Order Component

At the root of your app, usually `App.js`, wrap the app component with `Sentry.withTouchEventBoundary`:

```javascript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react-native';

const App = () => {
  return <RestOfTheApp />;
};

export default AppRegistry.registerComponent('Your Amazing App', () =>
  Sentry.withTouchEventBoundary(App)
);
```

While you can track specific sections of your app by wrapping each section with the boundary, do not nest them or the touches could be tracked multiple times along with possible undefined behavior.

## Automatic Touch Tracking

Each touch event is automatically logged as a breadcrumb and displays on the dashboard when an event occurs along with the component tree in which the touch event occurred. This component tree is logged using the `name` property of a component. By default, React Native will set this property automatically on components.

## Tracking Specific Components

You can let Sentry know which components to track specifically by passing the `sentry-label` prop to them. If Sentry detects a component with a `sentry-label` within a touch's component tree, it will be logged on the dashboard as having occurred in that component. If we cannot find a component with the label, we will fall back to the `accessibilityLabel` prop.

```javascript
const YourCoolComponent = props => {
  return (
    <View sentry-label="CardContainer">
      <Text sentry-label="CoolText">You are cool</Text>
    </View>
  );
};
```

<Note>

You don't have to worry about Typescript errors when passing the `sentry-label` prop. [Typescript will not throw an error on props with the '-' character](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html#attribute-type-checking).

</Note>

## Options

You can pass specific options to configure the boundary either as props to the `Sentry.TouchEventBoundary` component or as the second argument to the `Sentry.withTouchEventBoundary` higher-order component (HOC).

```javascript{tabTitle:Default}
<Sentry.TouchEventBoundary
  ignoreNames={["BadComponent", /^Connect\(/, /^LibraryComponent$/]}
>
  <RestOfTheApp />
</Sentry.TouchEventBoundary>
```

```javascript{tabTitle:HOC}
Sentry.withTouchEventBoundary(App, { maxComponentTreeSize: 15 });
```

`breadcrumbCategory`

: _String_. The category assigned to the breadcrumb that is logged by the touch event.

`breadcrumbType`

: _String_. The type assigned to the breadcrumb that is logged by the touch event.

`maxComponentTreeSize`

: _number, default: 20_. The max number/depth of components to display when logging a touch's component tree.

`ignoreNames`

: _Array<string | RegExp>, Accepts strings and regular expressions_. Component names to ignore when logging the touch event. This prevents unhelpful logs such as "Touch event within element: View" where you still can't tell which `View` it occurred in.

## Minified Names in Production

When bundling for production, React Native will minify class and function names to reduce the bundle size. This means that **you won't get the full original component names in your touch event breadcrumbs** and instead you will see minified names. Check out our [troubleshooting guide for minified production bundles](/platforms/react-native/troubleshooting/#minified-names-in-production) documentation to solve this.
