Use version `1.5.0` or later to track touch events with Sentry's React Native SDK. You will also need to wrap your app with a `TouchEventBoundary`.

## Wrapping with `TouchEventBoundary`

At the root of your app, usually `App.js`, wrap the app component with `Sentry.TouchEventBoundary`:

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react-native";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Sentry.TouchEventBoundary>
      <RestOfTheApp />
    </Sentry.TouchEventBoundary>
  );
};

export default AppRegistry.registerComponent("Your Amazing App", () => App);
```

## Using the `withTouchEventBoundary` Higher-Order Component

At the root of your app, usually `App.js`, wrap the app component with `Sentry.withTouchEventBoundary`:

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react-native";

const App = () => {
  return <RestOfTheApp />;
};

export default AppRegistry.registerComponent("Your Amazing App", () =>
  Sentry.withTouchEventBoundary(App)
);
```

While you can track specific sections of your app by wrapping each section with the boundary, do not nest them or the touches could be tracked multiple times along with possible undefined behavior.

## Automatic Touch Tracking

Each touch event is automatically logged as a breadcrumb and displays on the dashboard when an event occurs along with the component tree in which the touch event occurred. This component tree is logged using the `name` property of a component. By default, React Native will set this property automatically on components.

## Tracking Specific Components

You can let Sentry know which components to track specifically by setting the `displayName` property for them. If Sentry detects a component with a `displayName` within a touch's component tree, it will be logged on the dashboard as having occurred in that component.

```javascript
class YourCoolComponent extends React.Component {
  static displayName = "CoolComponent";
  render() {
    return <View>{/* ... */}</View>;
  }
}
```

or

```javascript
const YourCoolComponent = props => {
  return <View>{/* ... */}</View>;
};

YourCoolComponent.displayName = "CoolComponent";
```

## Options

You can pass specific options to configure the boundary either as props to the `Sentry.TouchEventBoundary` component or as the second argument to the `Sentry.withTouchEventBoundary` higher-order component (HOC).

```javascript
<Sentry.TouchEventBoundary
  ignoreNames={["BadComponent", /^Connect\(/, /^LibraryComponent$/]}
>
  <RestOfTheApp />
</Sentry.TouchEventBoundary>
```

```javascript
Sentry.withTouchEventBoundary(App, { maxComponentTreeSize: 15 });
```

`breadcrumbCategory`

: _String_. The category assigned to the breadcrumb that is logged by the touch event.

`breadcrumbType`

: _String_. The type assigned to the breadcrumb that is logged by the touch event.

`maxComponentTreeSize`

: _number, default: 20_. The max number/depth of components to display when logging a touch's component tree.

`ignoreNames`

: _Array<string | RegExp>, Accepts strings and regular expressions_. (New in version 1.7.0) Component names to ignore when logging the touch event. This prevents unhelpful logs such as "Touch event within element: View" where you still can't tell which `View` it occurred in.

## Production Bundles

When bundling for production, React Native will minify class and function names to reduce the bundle size. This means that you won't get the full original component names in your Touch Event breadcrumbs. A way to work with this is to set the `displayName` on all the components you want to track. However, you can also configure Metro bundler to not minify function names by setting these options in `metro.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  transformer: {
    minifierConfig: {
      keep_classnames: true, // Preserve class names
      keep_fnames: true, // Preserve function names
      mangle: {
        keep_classnames: true, // Preserve class names
        keep_fnames: true, // Preserve function names
      },
    },
  },
};
```

<Note>

As this applies to **all** class and function names — not just React components — this could increase your JS bundle size.
