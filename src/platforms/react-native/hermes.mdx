title: Hermes
---

Sentry added support for `react-native` builds that use the `hermes` engine, which required changes to the sentry SDK, `sentry-cli` as well as Sentry itself.

Sentry customers using the SaaS product (sentry.io) will need to update the SDK, and `sentry-cli`.
The minimum required version for the SDK is `@sentry/react-native` [SDK version `1.3.3`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-react-native/releases/tag/1.3.3),
and `@sentry/cli` [version `1.51.1`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cli/releases/tag/1.51.1).

For Sentry open source, self-hosted users, the minimum version required is [f07352b](https://hub.docker.com/r/getsentry/sentry/tags?page=1&name=f07352b).

Other than making sure you have the minimum version of the SDK, Sentry itself is all you need besides the standard integration described in the [React Native Sentry documentation](/clients/react-native/).

## Custom SourceMaps

The combination of `@sentry/react-native` and `@sentry/cli` should integrate
correctly into the `react-native` build pipeline to find and upload the correct source map.

However, care must be taken to upload the correct source map when manually bundling and building React Native apps.

Building Hermes bundles is a three-step process, each of which creates a different
source map.

1. Bundling / minifying using `metro`: `index.android.bundle.packager.map`
2. Compiling to bytecode using `hermes`: `index.android.bundle.compiler.map`
3. Merging SourceMaps using `compose-source-maps`: `index.android.bundle.packager.map + index.android.bundle.compiler.map => index.android.bundle.map`

It is important to upload the third SourceMap (`index.android.bundle.map`)
via `sentry-cli`.
