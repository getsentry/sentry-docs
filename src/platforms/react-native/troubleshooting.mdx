## Source Maps

When there is an issue with source maps on your event, there will usually be an error dialog at the top of the Issue Details page in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io):

> There was 1 problem processing this event: Source code was not found

Common fixes to this issue include:

- Checking that both the `release` and `dist` and are set on the event by [setting it in the call to `init`](/platforms/react-native/configuration/releases/#bind-the-version).
- Checking that source maps are correctly uploaded with the exact same `release` and `dist` values as the event. They **must match** for source maps to upload correctly.
- If you set a custom `release` and `dist`, confirming that you manually uploaded the sourcemaps since our automatic source map upload script will not detect the custom values.
- Checking that you are not disabling the [`RewriteFrames`](/platforms/javascript/configuration/integrations/plugin/#rewriteframes) default integration by overwriting it, filtering it out, or setting `defaultIntegrations: false`.

[For more details, please read the guide on React Native source maps.](/platforms/react-native/sourcemaps)

### Source Maps with Hermes on Android

You will need to perform some extra steps when using the source maps with the Hermes engine on Android. [You can follow the guide here.](/platforms/react-native/manual-setup/hermes/#custom-source-maps)

## iOS Build Script Failed

Try passing `--force-foreground` to the Sentry CLI command in the build script. This is possibly a bug with our CLI that [we are investigating](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-react-native/issues/1424).

```bash
# ...
../node_modules/@sentry/cli/bin/sentry-cli react-native xcode \
  ../node_modules/react-native/scripts/react-native-xcode.sh --force-foreground
```

## Release Health

- If your release health statistics are being attributed to the wrong release, confirm that you [pass the `release` and `dist` to the `init` call](/platforms/react-native/configuration/releases/#bind-the-version).
- If you are using Code Push, check that you are not using `setRelease` and `setDist` as they will break release health. You can read more on the [CodePush guide](/platforms/react-native/manual-setup/codepush/).

## Expo

<Alert level="warning" title="Version 3.x">

We have received reports of it being incompatible with `@sentry/react-native: 3.x`. Please stay on `@sentry/react-native: 2.6.2` if you use `sentry-expo`.

</Alert>

If you use the [sentry-expo](https://github.com/expo/sentry-expo) SDK, make sure that you do not manually upgrade the version of the `@sentry/react-native` SDK and instead rely on the version that the `sentry-expo` SDK depends on. Upgrading could cause a version mismatch that could lead to errors being unreported and other undefined behavior. This is due to the `sentry-expo` SDK not being officially maintained by Sentry but instead by the Expo team.
