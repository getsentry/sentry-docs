This integration tracks app hangs. This feature is available on iOS, tvOS, and macOS.

Trying to use an unresponsive app is extremely frustrating for users. There are many reasons why an app may become unresponsive, such as long-running code, infinite loop bugs, and so on. With app hang tracking you can detect and fix them.

Every time App Hang is detected an error event is created. App Hang Tracking is enabled by default. To disable it, set the `enableAppHangTracking` option to `false`:

```javascript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react-native';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: 'DSN',
  enableAppHangTracking: false,
});
```

The app hang detection integration has a default timeout of two (2) seconds. It represents the minimum amount of time an app should be unresponsive to be classified as an App Hanging. You can change the timeout by changing the `appHangTimeoutInterval` option:

```javascript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react-native';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: 'DSN',
  appHangTimeoutInterval: 1,
});
```
