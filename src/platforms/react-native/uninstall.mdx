To remove the SDK, run the following commands:

```bash
npx @sentry/wizard -i reactNative -p ios android --uninstall
yarn remove @sentry/react-native
cd ios && pod install
```

Once that's done, remove the `ios/sentry.properties` and `android/sentry.properties` files. Finally, remove all the code using `@sentry/react-native` from your project.
