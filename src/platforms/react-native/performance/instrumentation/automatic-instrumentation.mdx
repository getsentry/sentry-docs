`@sentry/react-native` provides automatic performance instrumentation out of the box when tracing is enabled.

## Set Up

To make the most out of our automatic instrumentation, you should:

### Wrap Your Root Component

Wrap your root component with Sentry to access the most Performance features.

```javascript {filename:App.js}
export default Sentry.wrap(App);
```

### Enable Routing Instrumentation

We currently provide three routing instrumentations out of the box to instrument route changes for:

- [React Navigation](#react-navigation)
- [React Navigation V4 and prior](#react-navigation-v4)
- [React Native Navigation](#react-native-navigation)

If you have a custom routing instrumentation or use a routing library we don't yet support, you can use the [bare bones routing instrumentation](#bare-bones) or [create your own](#custom-instrumentation) by extending it.

#### React Navigation

This instrumentation supports React Navigation version 5 and above. If you use React Navigation version 4, see the [instrumentation for React Navigation V4](#react-navigation-v4).

<Note>

If you are coming from a version prior to 2.3.0, make sure you update where `registerNavigationContainer` is called. You can find the instructions on [our migration guide](/platforms/react-native/migration/#react-navigation-instrumentation-from-230).

</Note>

Note that this routing instrumentation will create a transaction on every route change including `goBack` navigations.

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react-native";

// Construct a new instrumentation instance. This is needed to communicate between the integration and React
const routingInstrumentation = new Sentry.ReactNavigationInstrumentation();

Sentry.init({
  ...
  integrations: [
    new Sentry.ReactNativeTracing({
      // Pass instrumentation to be used as `routingInstrumentation`
      routingInstrumentation,
      // ...
    }),
  ],
})

// Functional Component Example
const App = () => {
  // Create a ref for the navigation container
  const navigation = React.useRef();

  return (
    // Connect the ref to the navigation container
    <NavigationContainer
      ref={navigation}
      onReady={() => {
        // Register the navigation container with the instrumentation
        routingInstrumentation.registerNavigationContainer(navigation);
      }}>
      ...
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
};

// Class Component Example
class App extends React.Component {
  // Create a ref for the navigation container
  navigation = React.createRef();

  render() {
    return (
      // Connect the ref to the navigation container
      <NavigationContainer
        ref={this.navigation}
        onReady={() => {
          // Register the navigation container with the instrumentation
          routingInstrumentation.registerNavigationContainer(navigation);
        }}>
        ...
      </NavigationContainer>
    )
  }
}
```

##### Configuration

You can configure the instrumentation by passing an options object to the constructor:

```javascript
new Sentry.ReactNavigationV5Instrumentation({ ... });
```

###### routeChangeTimeoutMs

How long the instrumentation will wait for the route to mount after a change has been initiated before the transaction is discarded. Default: 1000ms

#### React Navigation V4

Note that this routing instrumentation will create a transaction on every route change including `goBack` navigations.

```javascript
// Construct a new instrumentation instance. This is needed to communicate between the integration and React
const routingInstrumentation = new Sentry.ReactNavigationV4Instrumentation();

Sentry.init({
  ...
  integrations: [
    new Sentry.ReactNativeTracing({
      // Pass instrumentation to be used as `routingInstrumentation`
      routingInstrumentation,
      ...
    }),
  ],
})

// Functional Component Example
const App = () => {
  // Create a ref for the navigation container
  const appContainer = React.useRef();

  // Register the navigation container with the instrumentation
  React.useEffect(() => {
    routingInstrumentation.registerAppContainer(appContainer);
  }, []);

  return (
    // Connect the ref to the navigation container
    <AppContainer ref={appContainer} />
  );
};

// Class Component Example
class App extends React.Component {
  // Create a ref for the navigation container
  appContainer = React.createRef();

  componentDidMount() {
    // Register the navigation container with the instrumentation
    routingInstrumentation.registerAppContainer(this.appContainer);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      // Connect the ref to the navigation container
      <AppContainer ref={this.appContainer} />
    )
  }
}
```

##### Configuration

You can configure the instrumentation by passing an options object to the constructor:

```javascript
new Sentry.ReactNavigationV4Instrumentation({ ... });
```

###### routeChangeTimeoutMs

How long the instrumentation will wait for the **initial** route to mount after a change has been initiated before the transaction is discarded. Default: 1000ms

#### React Native Navigation

<Note>

Our React Native Navigation instrumentation is currently in beta and is available from version `3.2.0-beta.1` onwards.

</Note>

This instrumentation supports [react-native-navigation](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation). You will need to pass the `Navigation` object imported from the library to initialize our routing instrumentation. It is recommended that you initialize our SDK and the routing instrumentation as early as possible in the lifecycle of your app; this would most likely be before the point where you initialize your screens.

```javascript {filename: index.js}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react-native";
import { Navigation } from 'react-native-navigation';

Sentry.init({
  ...
  integrations: [
    new Sentry.ReactNativeTracing({
      // Pass instrumentation to be used as `routingInstrumentation`
      routingInstrumentation: new Sentry.ReactNativeNavigationInstrumentation(
        Navigation,
      )
      // ...
    }),
  ],
})
```

##### Configuration

You can configure the instrumentation by passing an options object to the constructor:

```javascript
new Sentry.ReactNativeNavigationInstrumentation({ ... });
```

###### routeChangeTimeoutMs

How long the instrumentation will wait for the route to mount after a change has been initiated, before the transaction is discarded. Default: 1000ms

#### Other Routing Libraries or Custom Routing Implementations

If you use another routing library that we don't yet support, or have a custom routing solution, you can use the basic `RoutingInstrumentation` we provide, or extend it to create your own instrumentation.

Every routing instrumentation revoles around one method:

`onRouteWillChange` (context: TransactionContext): Transaction | undefined

You need to ensure that this method is called **before** the route change occurs, and an `IdleTransaction` is created and set on the scope.

##### Bare Bones

```javascript
// Construct a new instrumentation instance. This is needed to communicate between the integration and React
const routingInstrumentation = new Sentry.RoutingInstrumentation();

Sentry.init({
  ...
  integrations: [
    new Sentry.ReactNativeTracing({
      // Pass instrumentation to be used as `routingInstrumentation`
      routingInstrumentation,
      ...
    }),
  ],
})

const App = () => {
  <SomeNavigationLibrary
    onRouteWillChange={(newRoute) => {
        // Call this before the route changes
      routingInstrumentation.onRouteWillChange({
        name: newRoute.name,
        op: 'navigation'
      })
    }}
  />
};
```

##### Custom Instrumentation

To create a custom routing instrumentation, look at how the `RoutingInstrumentation` class [is implemented](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-react-native/blob/211ec081b6bf8d7d29541afe9d800040f61e3c4e/src/js/tracing/routingInstrumentation.ts). If you need an example of how to implement routing instrumentation, review the code of the existing official instrumentation such as [the one for React Navigation V4](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-react-native/blob/211ec081b6bf8d7d29541afe9d800040f61e3c4e/src/js/tracing/reactnavigationv4.ts)

```javascript
class CustomInstrumentation extends RoutingInstrumentation {
  constructor(navigator) {
    super();

    this.navigator.registerRouteChangeListener(this.routeListener.bind(this));
  }

  routeListener(newRoute) {
    // Again, ensure this is called BEFORE the route changes and BEFORE the route is mounted.
    this.onRouteWillChange({
      name: newRoute.name,
      op: "navigation",
    });
  }
}
```

## Features

Sentry offers the following automatic instrumentation features.

### App Start Instrumentation

The App Start Instrumentation provides insight into how long your application takes to launch. It tracks the length of time from the **earliest native process initialization** until the **React Native root component mounts**.

<Note>

If you don't [wrap your root component with Sentry](#wrap-your-root-component), the App Start measurement will finish when the JavaScript code is initialized instead of when the first component mount.

</Note>

The SDK differentiates between a cold and a warm start, but doesn't track hot starts/resumes.

- **Cold start**: App launched for the first time, after a reboot or update. The app is not in memory and no process exists.
- **Warm start**: App launched at least once, is partially in memory, and no process exists.

Cold and warm start are Mobile Vitals, which you can learn about in the [full documentation](/product/performance/mobile-vitals).

### Slow and Frozen Frames

Unresponsive UI and animation hitches annoy users and degrade the user experience. Two measurements to track these types of experiences are slow frames and frozen frames. If you want your app to run smoothly, you should try to avoid both. The SDK adds these two measurements for the transactions you capture.

- **Slow Frames**: Slow frames are captured by the SDK when the app takes more than 16.67 ms to render a frame. Typically, a phone or tablet renders 60 frames per second (fps), though the frame rate can be higher, especially as 120 fps displays become popular. At 60 fps, every frame has 16.67 ms to render; slower than that, and the app has slow frames.
- **Frozen Frames**: Frozen frames are UI frames that take longer than 700 ms to render.

Slow and frozen frames are Mobile Vitals, which you can learn about in the [full documentation](/product/performance/mobile-vitals).

### Stall Tracking

A stall is when the JavaScript event loop takes longer than expected to complete. A stall in your JavaScript code will not just make your UI unresponsive, but also slow down the logic that is contained within JavaScript. This slows everything down, creating a bad experience for your users.

We track stalls that occur in your React Native app during a transaction and provide you with these values:

- **Longest Stall Time**: The time, in milliseconds, of the longest event loop stall.
- **Total Stall Time**: The total combined time, in milliseconds, of all stalls.
- **Stall Count**: The total number of stalls that occurred during the transaction.

### Fetch/XML Request Instrumentation

The tracing integration creates a child span for every `XMLHttpRequest` or `fetch` request on the Javascript layer that occurs while those transactions are open. Learn more about [traces, transactions, and spans](/product/sentry-basics/tracing/distributed-tracing/).

## Configuration Options

To configure the automatic performance instrumentation, you will need to add the `ReactNativeTracing` integration yourself. We provide many options by default, so for the majority of apps you won't need to configure the integration yourself.

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react-native";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  integrations: [
    new Sentry.ReactNativeTracing({
      tracingOrigins: ["localhost", "my-site-url.com", /^\//],
      // ... other options
    }),
  ],
});
```

For all possible options, see [ReactNativeTracingOptions](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-react-native/blob/211ec081b6bf8d7d29541afe9d800040f61e3c4e/src/js/tracing/reactnativetracing.ts#L23).

### beforeNavigate

You can use `beforeNavigate` to modify the transaction from routing instrumentation before the transaction is created. If you prefer not to send the transaction, set `sampled = false`.

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    new Sentry.ReactNativeTracing({
      routingInstrumentation,
      beforeNavigate: context => {
        // Decide to not send a transaction by setting sampled = false
        if (context.data.route.name === "Do Not Send") {
          context.sampled = false;
        }

        // Modify the transaction context
        context.name = context.name.toUpperCase();
        context.tags = {
          ...context.tags,
          customTag: "value",
        };

        return context;
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

If you use our routing instrumentation for **React Navigation**, the route data is set on the transaction context passed to `beforeNavigate`. This has the type:

```typescript
type ReactNavigationTransactionContext = {
  // ...
  data: {
    route: {
      name: string;
      key: string;
      params: {
        [key: string]: any;
      };
      /** Will be true if this is not the first time this screen with this key has been seen before. */
      hasBeenSeen: boolean;
    };
    previousRoute: {
      name: string;
      key: string;
      params: {
        [key: string]: any;
      };
    } | null;
  };
};
```

If you use **Typescript**, you can type your `beforeNavigate` function with `Sentry.ReactNavigationTransactionContext`.

### tracingOrigins

The default value of `tracingOrigins` is `['localhost', /^\//]`. The React Native SDK will attach the `sentry-trace` header to all outgoing XHR/fetch requests whose destination contains a string in the list or matches a regex in the list. If your frontend is making requests to a different domain, you will need to add the domain there to propagate the `sentry-trace` header to the backend services, which is required to link transactions together as part of a single trace. **The `tracingOrigins` option matches against the entire request URL, not just the domain. Using stricter regex to match certain parts of the URL ensures that requests do not unnecessarily have the `sentry-trace` header attached.**

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/tracingOrigins-example" />

You will need to configure your web server CORS to allow the `sentry-trace` header. The configuration might look like `"Access-Control-Allow-Headers: sentry-trace"`, but the configuration depends on your setup. If you do not allow the `sentry-trace` header, the request might be blocked.

### shouldCreateSpanForRequest

This function can be used to filter out unwanted spans, such as XHR's running health checks or something similar. By default, `shouldCreateSpanForRequest` already filters out everything except what was defined in `tracingOrigins`.

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/filter-span-example" />

## Recipes

Currently, by default, the React Native SDK will only create child spans for fetch/XHR transactions out of the box. This means once you are done setting up your routing instrumentation, you will either see just a few fetch/XHR child spans or no children at all. To find out how to customize instrumentation your app, review our <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation/">Custom Instrumentation</PlatformLink>.

### React Profiler

We export the React Profiler from our React Native SDK as well, you can read more at [React Profiler](/platforms/javascript/guides/react/components/profiler/).

After you instrument your app's routing, if you wrap a component that renders on one of the routes with `withProfiler`, you will be able to track the component's lifecycle as a child span of the route transaction.

```javascript {tabTitle: Higher Order Component}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react-native";

// withProfiler HOC
const SomeComponent = () => {
  // ...
};

export default Sentry.withProfiler(SomeComponent);
```

```javascript {tabTitle: Parent Component}
// Profiler parent
const SomeComponent = () => {
  return (
    <Sentry.Profiler name="SomeChild">
      <SomeChild />
    </Sentry.Profiler>
  );
};
```

```javascript {tabTitle: Hook}
// useProfiler hook
const SomeComponent = () => {
  Sentry.useProfiler("SomeComponent");

  return (
    //...
  )
}
```

## Opt Out

If you want to use tracing without our automatic instrumentation, you can disable it by setting `enableAutoPerformanceTracking` in your Sentry options and removing the `ReactNativeTracing` integration, if you added it:

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react-native";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  enableAutoPerformanceTracking: false,
});
```
