Sentry's React Native SDK works out of the box with Expo applications. To see readable stack traces in the product source maps need to be uploaded to Sentry. This guide explains how to upload source maps for Expo applications.

## Prerequisities

- [Sign up for an account](https://sentry.io/signup/)
- [Migrate from `sentry-expo` to `@sentry/react-native`](/platforms/react-native/migration/sentry-expo/)

## Automatic Upload for Release

When Sentry Expo Plugin `@sentry/react-native/expo` and Sentry Metro Pugin are added to the application configuration source maps for the native builds are uploaded automatically during EAS Builds. And also when building the native application release locally using `expo prebuild`.

## Manual Upload for EAS Updates

To upload source maps for EAS Updates and `expo export` set up the Sentry Expo Plugin, Sentry Metro plugin and execute the `sentry-expo upload-sourcemaps` command.

### Create Update

To create an update for the application use the following command:

```bash
# expo export
eas update
```

### Upload source maps

To upload source maps for all platforms use the following command:

```bash
SENTRY_PROJECT=___PROJECT_SLUG___ \
SENTRY_ORG=___ORG_SLUG___ \
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=___ORG_AUTH_TOKEN___ \
npx sentry-expo-upload-sourcemaps dist
```

#### Notes

- `dist` is the default output directory of `eas update`.
