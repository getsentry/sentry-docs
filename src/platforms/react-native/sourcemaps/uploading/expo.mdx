Sentry's React Native SDK package supports Expo applications. To see readable stack traces in the product correct source maps need to be uploaded to Sentry. This guide explains how to upload source maps for Expo applications.

## Prerequisities

- [Sign up for an account](https://sentry.io/signup/)
- [Set up Sentry React Native SDK](/platforms/react-native/manual-setup/expo/) version 5.16.0-alpha.4 or newer

<OrgAuthTokenNote />

## Common Setup

To upload any kind of source maps to Sentry you need to add the Sentry Expo Plugin and Sentry Metro Plugin to your Expo application.

### Add the Sentry Expo Plugin

To ensure the bundles and source maps are automatically uploaded during the local and EAS native applications builds, add `withSentry` to the Expo application configuration:

```javascript {tabTitle:app.json/app.config.json}
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      [
        "@sentry/react-native/expo",
        {
          "url": "https://sentry.io/",
          "warning": "DO NOT COMMIT YOUR AUTH TOKEN",
          "authToken": "___ORG_AUTH_TOKEN___",
          "project": "___PROJECT_SLUG___",
          "organization": "___ORG_SLUG___"
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

```javascript {tabTitle:app.config.js}
const { withSentry } = require("@sentry/react-native/expo");

const config = {
  name: "Expo Example",
  slug: "expo-example",
};

module.exports = withSentry(config, {
  url: "https://sentry.io/",
  // DO NOT COMMIT YOUR AUTH TOKEN
  authToken: "___ORG_AUTH_TOKEN___",
  project: "___PROJECT_SLUG___s",
  organization: "___ORG_SLUG___",
});
```

```typescript {tabTitle:app.config.ts}
import { ExpoConfig } from "expo/config";
import { withSentry } from "@sentry/react-native/expo";

const config: ExpoConfig = {
  name: "Expo Example",
  slug: "expo-example",
};

export default withSentry(config, {
  url: "https://sentry.io/",
  // DO NOT COMMIT YOUR AUTH TOKEN
  authToken: "___ORG_AUTH_TOKEN___",
  project: "___PROJECT_SLUG___",
  organization: "___ORG_SLUG___",
});
```

### Add Sentry Metro Plugin

To ensure unique Debug IDs get assigned to the generated bundles and source maps, add Sentry Serializer to the Metro configuration:

```javascript {tabTitle:metro.config.js}
// const { getDefaultConfig } = require("expo/metro-config");
const { getSentryExpoConfig } = require("@sentry/react-native/metro");

// const config = getDefaultConfig(__dirname);
const config = getSentryExpoConfig(__dirname);

module.exports = config;
```

## Automatic Upload for Release

When Sentry Expo Plugin `@sentry/react-native/expo` and Sentry Metro Pugin are added to the application configuration source maps for the native builds are uploaded automatically during EAS Builds. And also when building the native application release locally using `expo prebuild`.

## Manual Upload for EAS Updates

To upload source maps for EAS Updates and `expo export` set up the Sentry Expo Plugin, Sentry Metro plugin and execute the `sentry-expo upload-sourcemaps` command.

### Create Update

To create an update for the application use the following command:

```bash
# expo export
eas update
```

### Upload source maps

To upload source maps for all platforms use the following command:

```bash
SENTRY_PROJECT=___PROJECT_SLUG___ \
SENTRY_ORG=___ORG_SLUG___ \
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=___ORG_AUTH_TOKEN___ \
npx sentry-expo-upload-sourcemaps dist
```

#### Notes

- `dist` is the default output directory for `eas update`.
