<Alert level="info" title="Experimental Support">

The Expo support is currently experimental and available since version `5.16.0-alpha.4`.

Experimental support means it may have bugs. We recognize the irony.

</Alert>

This guide scribes how to migrate from `sentry-expo` to `@sentry/react-native` in your Expo application.

## Remove `sentry-expo`

First, remove `sentry-expo` from your dependencies:

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm uninstall sentry-expo
```

```bash {tabTitle:Yarn}
yarn remove sentry-expo
```

### Install `@sentry/react-native`

Install the `@sentry/react-native` package:

```bash {tabTitle:Expo}
npx expo install @sentry/react-native
```

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install --save @sentry/react-native
```

```bash {tabTitle:Yarn}
yarn add @sentry/react-native
```

### Fix imports

Replace all imports of `sentry-expo` with `@sentry/react-native`:

```diff {tabTitle:JavaScript}
- import * as Sentry from 'sentry-expo';
+ import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react-native';
```

Replace `sentry-expo` exports `Browser` and `React` by `@sentry/react`:

```diff {tabTitle:JavaScript}
- import { Browser, React } from 'sentry-expo';
+ import * as Browser from '@sentry/react';
+ import * as React from '@sentry/react';
```

Replace `sentry-expo` export `Native` by `@sentry/react-native`:

```diff {tabTitle:JavaScript}
- import { Native } from 'sentry-expo';
+ import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react-native';
```

### Review `Sentry.init` options

Option `enableInExpoDevelopment` is no longer supported. If you were using it, you can remove it and replace by `__DEV__` check or leave the SDK enabled in development.

```diff {tabTitle:JavaScript}
Sentry.init({
-  enableInExpoDevelopment: true,
+  enabled: __DEV__,
});
```

### Changes in default tags

Expo specific tags are no longer added by default. If you were using them, you can add them manually:

```js
import Constants from 'expo-constants';
import * as Device from 'expo-device';
import * as Updates from 'expo-updates';

import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react-native';

Sentry.setExtras({
  manifest,
  deviceYearClass: Device.deviceYearClass,
  linkingUri: Constants.linkingUri,
});

Sentry.setTag('expoReleaseChannel', Updates.manifest.releaseChannel);
Sentry.setTag('appVersion', Updates.manifest.version);
Sentry.setTag('appPublishedTime', Updates.manifest.publishedTime);
Sentry.setTag('expoSdkVersion', Updates.manifest.sdkVersion);
Sentry.setTag('deviceId', Constants.sessionId);
Sentry.setTag('appOwnership', Constants.appOwnership || 'N/A');
if (Constants.appOwnership === 'expo' && Constants.expoVersion) {
  setTag('expoAppVersion', Constants.expoVersion);
}
Sentry.setTag('expoChannel', Updates.channel);
```

## Review `react-native-web` compatibility

The `sentry-expo` package automatically switched to `@sentry/react` for `react-native-web` builds. This is no longer the case with `@sentry/react-native` which supports `react-native-web` out of the box.

Note that some features might not be supported or work differently in `@sentry/react-native` on `react-native-web` compared to direct usage of `@sentry/react`. Please verify with your application that features you use work as expected.

If you wish to continue using `@sentry/react` for `react-native-web` builds, you can do soo. See [@sentry/react](/platforms/javascript/guides/react/) for more details about the web React package.

## Setup `@sentry/react-native` Expo and Metro plugin

When steps above are done, you can setup the Expo and Metro plugin for `@sentry/react-native`:
