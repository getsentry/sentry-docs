<Alert level="info" title="Experimental Support">

The Expo support is currently experimental and available since version `5.16.0-alpha.1`.

Experimental support means it may have bugs. We recognize the irony.

</Alert>

This guide scribes how to migrate from `sentry-expo` to `@sentry/react-native` in your Expo application.

### Remove `sentry-expo`

First, remove `sentry-expo` from your dependencies:

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm uninstall sentry-expo
```

```bash {tabTitle:Yarn}
yarn remove sentry-expo
```

### Install `@sentry/react-native`

Install the `@sentry/react-native` package:

```bash {tabTitle:Expo}
npx expo install @sentry/react-native
```

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install --save @sentry/react-native
```

```bash {tabTitle:Yarn}
yarn add @sentry/react-native
```

### Fix imports

Replace all imports of `sentry-expo` with `@sentry/react-native`:

```diff {tabTitle:JavaScript}
- import * as Sentry from 'sentry-expo';
+ import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react-native';
```

Replace `sentry-expo` browser React exports `Browser` and `React` by `@sentry/react`:

```diff {tabTitle:JavaScript}
- import * as Sentry from 'sentry-expo';
- const SentryBrowser = Sentry.Browser;
- const SentryReact = Sentry.React;
+ import * as SentryReact from '@sentry/react';
```

Replace `sentry-expo` React Native `Native` export by `@sentry/react-native`:

```diff {tabTitle:JavaScript}
- import * as Sentry from 'sentry-expo';
- const SentryReactNative = Sentry.Native;
+ import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react-native';
```

### Review `Sentry.init` options

Option `enableInExpoDevelopment` is no longer supported. If you were using it, you can remove it and replace by `__DEV__` check or leave the SDK enabled in development.

```diff {tabTitle:JavaScript}
Sentry.init({
-  enableInExpoDevelopment: true,
+  enabled: __DEV__,
});
```

### Changes in default tags

Expo specific tags are no longer added by default. If you were using them, you can add them manually:

```js
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react-native';

Sentry.setTag('expoReleaseChannel'. '');
Sentry.setTag('appVersion'. '');
Sentry.setTag('appPublishedTime'. '');
Sentry.setTag('expoSdkVersion'. '');
Sentry.setTag('deviceId'. '');
Sentry.setTag('appOwnership'. '');
Sentry.setTag('expoAppVersion'. '');
Sentry.setTag('expoChannel'. '');

Sentry.setExtras({
  manifest,
  deviceYearClass: Device.deviceYearClass,
  linkingUri: Constants.linkingUri,
});
```

### Review `react-native-web` compatibility

`sentry-expo` automatically used the `@sentry/react`
