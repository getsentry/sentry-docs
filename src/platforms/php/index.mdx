On this page, we get you up and running with Sentry's PHP SDK, automatically reporting errors and exceptions in your application.

<Note><markdown>

If you don't already have an account and Sentry project established, head over to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/signup/), then return to this page.

The Sentry PHP SDK provides support for PHP 7.1 or later.

## Install

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your application’s runtime. These are platform-specific and allow Sentry to have a deep understanding of how your application works.

To install the PHP SDK, you need to be using Composer in your project. For more details about Composer, see the [Composer documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/).

```bash
composer require sentry/sdk
```

## Configure

After you’ve completed setting up a project in Sentry, Sentry will give you a value which we call a DSN or Data Source Name. It looks a lot like a standard URL, but it’s just a representation of the configuration required by the Sentry SDKs. It consists of a few pieces, including the protocol, public key, the server address, and the project identifier.

To capture all errors, even the one during the startup of your application, you should initialize the Sentry PHP SDK as soon as possible.

```php
Sentry\init(['dsn' => '___PUBLIC_DSN___' ]);
```

## Capturing Errors

In PHP you can either capture a caught exception or capture the last error with captureLastError.

```php
try {
    $this->functionFailsForSure();
} catch (\Throwable $exception) {
    Sentry\captureException($exception);
}

// OR

Sentry\captureLastError();
```
