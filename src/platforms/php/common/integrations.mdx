## Default Integrations

Default integrations are integrations enabled by default that integrate into the
standard library or the interpreter itself. They are documented so you can see
what they do and that they can be disabled if they cause issues. To disable
system integrations set `default_integrations => false` when calling `init()`.

### ExceptionListenerIntegration

This integration catches all global uncaught exceptions and emits events when an error occurs.

To do that, it ensures that Sentry's `ErrorHandler` is registered, and adds a callback to it
as an exception listener.

### ErrorListenerIntegration

This integration hooks into the global PHP `error_handler` and emits events when an error occurs.

To do that, it ensures that Sentry's `ErrorHandler` is registered, and adds a callback to it
as an error listener. By default, the `ErrorHandler` reserves 10 kilobytes of memory to handle
fatal errors.

For some frameworks or projects, there are specific integrations provided both
officially and by third-party users that automatically register the error
handlers. In that case, please refer to their documentation.

Also, by default `E_ALL` will be handled, you can change it by setting `error_types`
a different constant in `init()`.

### FatalErrorListenerIntegration

This integration catches all fatal errors and emits the corresponding events.

To do that, it ensures that Sentry's `ErrorHandler` is registered, and adds a callback to it
as a fatal error listener.

### RequestIntegration

This integration adds to the event request data like:

- HTTP method
- URL (including the query string)
- Body (by default only if the body is 10Kb or less)

If the [`send_default_pii` option](../configuration/options/#send-default-pii) is enabled, it will also send PII information like:

- IP address
- Cookies
- Headers

### TransactionIntegration

This integration sets the `transaction` attribute of the event to the value found in the raw event payload or to the value of the `PATH_INFO` server var if present.

### FrameContextifierIntegration

This integration reads excerpts of code around the line that originated an error.

### EnvironmentIntegration

This integration fills the event data with PHP runtime and server OS information.


## Optional Integrations

You can enable option integration by passing them to the `integrations` option when initializing the Sentry SDK.

In the example below we add the optional `ModulesIntegration`.

```php
\Sentry\init([
    'dsn' => '...',
    'integrations' => [
        new \Sentry\Integration\ModulesIntegration(),
    ],
]);
```

### IgnoreErrorsIntegration

This integration decides whether an event should not be captured according to a series of options that must match with its data.

### ModulesIntegration

This integration logs with the event details all the versions of the packages installed with Composer; the root project is included too.


## Customize Integrations

It is also possible to customize the list of integration without disabling the default integration using the `integrations` option and passing a callable.

In the example below we leave all integrations enabled exception for the `ExceptionListenerIntegration` and add the `ModulesIntegration`.

```php
\Sentry\init([
    'dsn' => '...',
    'integrations' => static function (array $integrations) {
        $integrations = array_filter($integrations, static function (\Sentry\Integration\IntegrationInterface $integration) {
            // Check if the integration if an instance of the exception listener and return false to remove it from the array
            if ($integration instanceof \Sentry\Integration\ExceptionListenerIntegration) {
                return false;
            }

            return true;
        });

        $integrations[] = new \Sentry\Integration\ModulesIntegration();

        return $integrations;
    },
]);
```
