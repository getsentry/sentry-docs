<Note>

Metrics for PHP are supported with Sentry PHP SDK version `4.5.0` and above.

</Note>

Sentry metrics help you pinpoint and solve issues that impact user experience and app performance by measuring the data points that are important to you. You can track things like processing time, event size, user signups, and conversion rates, then correlate them back to tracing data in order to get deeper insights and solve issues faster.
## Setup

To attach the code location of your metrics, set `attach_metric_code_locations` to `true` (the default is `false`).

```php
\Sentry\init([
   'dsn' => '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
   'attach_metric_code_locations' => true, 
]);

## Emit a Counter

Counters are one of the more basic types of metrics and can be used to count certain event occurrences.

To emit a counter, do the following:

```php
// Increment a counter by one for each button click.
\Sentry\metrics()->increment(
    key: 'button_click',
    value: 1,
    tags: [
        'browser' => 'Firefox',
        'app_version' => '1.0.0',
    ],
)
```

## Emit a distribution

Distributions are useful to get the most insights from your data. With distributions, you can obtain aggregations such as `p90`, `min`, `max`, and `avg`, making them very powerful.

```php
// Add '15.0' to a distribution used for tracking the loading times per page.
\Sentry\metrics()->distribution(
    key: 'page_load',
    value: 15.0,
    unit: \Sentry\Metrics\MetricsUnit::millisecond(),
    tags: [
        'page' => '/home',
    ],
)
```

## Emit a set

Sets are useful for counting unique occurrences. With sets, you can obtain the count of unique elements you added, making them very useful for certain cases.

```php
// Add 'jane' to a set used for tracking the number of users that viewed a page.
\Sentry\metrics()->set(
    key: 'user_view',
    value: 'jane',
    unit: \Sentry\Metrics\MetricsUnit::custom('username'),
    tags: [
        'page' => '/home',
    ],
)
```

## Emit a gauge

Gauges are a special kind of metric. You can obtain aggregates like `min`, `max`, `avg`, `sum`, and `count` with gauges but no percentiles. You might wonder why I need gauges if I have distributions that can do the same and more. The answer has to do with space efficiency since gauges can be represented in a much more space-efficient way, so if you don't need percentiles, gauges are the way to go.

```php
// Add '15.0' to a gauge used for tracking the loading times for a page.
\Sentry\metrics()->set(
    key: 'page_load',
    value: 15.0,
    unit: \Sentry\Metrics\MetricsUnit::millisecond(),
    tags: [
        'page' => '/home',
    ],
)
```

## Emit a timer

Timers, which are implemented as a distribution with unit second, can be used to measure the execution time of a certain block of code.

```php
\Sentry\metrics()->timing(
    key: 'event_processing_time',
    callback: static fn() => process(),
);
```

## Flush your metrics

All metrics emitted need to be manually flushed to Sentry.

```php
use function Sentry\metrics;

metrics()->flush();
```

To reduce overhead, we recommend registering the flushing in a shutdown function.

```php
use function Sentry\metrics;

register_shutdown_function(static fn () => metrics()->flush());
```
