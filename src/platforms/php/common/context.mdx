Sentry supports additional context with events. Often this context is shared
among any issue captured in its lifecycle, and includes the following
components:

**Structured Contexts**

: Structured contexts are typically set automatically.

[**User**](#capturing-the-user)

: Information about the current actor.

[**Tags**](#tagging-events)

: Key/value pairs which generate breakdown charts and search filters.

[**Level**](#setting-the-level)

: An event's severity.

[**Fingerprint**](#setting-the-fingerprint)

: A value used for grouping events into issues.

[**Unstructured Extra Data**](#extra-context)

: Arbitrary unstructured data which the Sentry SDK stores with an event sample.

Sentry will try its best to accommodate the data you send it, but large context
payloads will be trimmed or may be truncated entirely. For more details see the
[data handling SDK documentation](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/data-handling/)

### Extra Context

In addition to the structured context that Sentry understands, you can send arbitrary key/value pairs of data which the Sentry SDK will store alongside the event. These are not indexed, and the Sentry SDK uses them to add additional information about what might be happening.

```php
Sentry\configureScope(function (Sentry\State\Scope $scope): void {
  $scope->setExtra('character_name', 'Mighty Fighter');
});
```

### Capturing the User

Sending users to Sentry will unlock many features, primarily the ability to drill down into the number of users affecting an issue, as well as to get a broader sense about the quality of the application.

```php
Sentry\configureScope(function (Sentry\State\Scope $scope): void {
  $scope->setUser(['email' => 'john.doe@example.com']);
});
```

Users consist of a few critical pieces of information which are used to
construct a unique identity in Sentry. Each of these is optional, but
one **must** be present for the Sentry SDK to capture the user:

`id`

: Your internal identifier for the user.

`username`

: The user's username. Generally used as a better label than the internal ID.

`email`

: An alternative, or addition, to a username. Sentry is aware of email addresses
and can show things like Gravatars, unlock messaging capabilities, and more.

`ip_address`

: The IP address of the user. If the user is unauthenticated, providing the IP
address will suggest that this is unique to that IP. If available, we will
attempt to pull this from the HTTP request data.

Additionally, you can provide arbitrary key/value pairs beyond the reserved
names, and the Sentry SDK will store those with the user.

### Tagging Events

Tags are key/value pairs assigned to events that can be used for breaking down
issues or quick access to finding related events.

Most SDKs generally support configuring tags by configuring the scope:

```php
Sentry\configureScope(function (Sentry\State\Scope $scope): void {
  $scope->setTag('page_locale', 'de-at');
});
```

Several common uses for tags include:

- The hostname of the server
- The version of your platform (For example, iOS 5.0)
- The user’s language

Once you’ve started sending tagged data, you’ll see it show up in a few places:

- The filters within the sidebar on the project stream page.
- Summarized within an event on the sidebar.
- The tags page on an aggregated event.

We’ll automatically index all tags for an event, as well as the frequency and the last time the Sentry SDK has seen a value. Even more so, we keep track of the number of distinct tags and can assist you in determining hotspots for various issues.

### Setting the Level

You can set the severity of an event to one of five values: `fatal,` `error,` `warning,` `info,` and `debug.` `error` is the default, `fatal` is the most severe and `debug` is the least severe.

```php
Sentry\configureScope(function (Sentry\State\Scope $scope): void {
  $scope->setLevel(Sentry\Severity::warning());
});
```

### Setting the Fingerprint

Sentry uses one or more “fingerprints” to decide how to group errors into issues.

For some very advanced use cases, you can override the Sentry default grouping using the `fingerprint` attribute. In supported SDKs, this attribute can be passed with the event information and should be an array of strings.

If you wish to append information, thus making the grouping slightly less aggressive, you can do that as well by adding the special string `` as one of the items.
