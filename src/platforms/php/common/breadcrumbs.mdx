Sentry will automatically record specific events, such as changes to the URL and XHR requests to provide context to an error.

You can manually add breadcrumbs on other events or disable breadcrumbs.

```php
Sentry\addBreadcrumb(new Sentry\Breadcrumb(
  Sentry\Breadcrumb::LEVEL_ERROR,
  Sentry\Breadcrumb::TYPE_ERROR,
  'error_reporting',
  'foo bar'
));
```
