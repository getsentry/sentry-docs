Sentry PHP is not tied to any specific library that sends HTTP messages. Instead,
it uses [Httplug](https://github.com/php-http/httplug) to let users choose whichever PSR-7 implementation and HTTP client
they want to use.

We recommend that you use the `sentry/sdk` meta-package which provides our recommend HTTP client.

If you want to use a different HTTP client just install `sentry/sentry` with the clients you prefer:

```bash
composer require sentry/sentry php-http/curl-client guzzlehttp/psr7
```

This will install the library itself along with an HTTP client adapter that uses
cURL as the transport method (provided by [Httplug](https://github.com/php-http/httplug) and a PSR-7 implementation
(provided by Guzzle). You do not have to use those packages if you do not want to.
The SDK does not care about which transport method you want to use because it's
an implementation detail of your application. You may use any package that provides
[php-http/async-client-implementation](https://packagist.org/providers/php-http/async-client-implementation) and [http-message-implementation](https://packagist.org/providers/psr/http-message-implementation).

If you want to use Guzzle as an underlying HTTP client, you just need to run the
following command to install the adapter and Guzzle itself:

```bash
composer require php-http/guzzle6-adapter
```

#### Transport Classes

Transports are the classes in Sentry PHP that are responsible for communicating
with a service in order to deliver an event. There are several types of transports
available out-of-the-box, all of which implement the `TransportInterface`
interface;

- The `NullTransport` which is used in case you do not define a `DSN` in the options. It will not send events.
- The `HttpTransport` which is the default and will be used when the server
  is set in the client configuration.

The examples below pretty much replace the `\Sentry\init()` call.
Please also keep in mind that once a Client is initialized with a Transport it cannot be
changed.

##### NullTransport

Although not so common there could be cases in which you don't want to send
events at all. The `NullTransport` transport does this: it simply ignores
the events, but report them as sent.

```php
use Sentry\ClientBuilder;
use Sentry\Transport\NullTransport;
use Sentry\SentrySdk;
use Sentry\Transport\TransportFactoryInterface;

$transportFactory = new class implements TransportFactoryInterface {

    public function create(\Sentry\Options $options): \Sentry\Transport\TransportInterface
    {
        return new NullTransport();
    }
};

$builder = ClientBuilder::create(['dsn' => '___PUBLIC_DSN___']);
$builder->setTransportFactory($transportFactory);

SentrySdk::getCurrentHub()->bindClient($builder->getClient());
```

<Alert level="warning" title="Note">

`SentrySdk::getCurrentHub()->bindClient($builder->getClient());` is required to make the global function calls to use your new `Client` instead.

</Alert>

##### HttpTransport

The `HttpTransport` sends events over the HTTP protocol using [Httplug](https://httplug.io/).
The best adapter available is automatically selected when creating a client instance
through the client builder, but you can override it using the appropriate methods.

```php
use Http\Discovery\HttpAsyncClientDiscovery;
use Http\Discovery\MessageFactoryDiscovery;
use Http\Discovery\StreamFactoryDiscovery;
use Http\Discovery\UriFactoryDiscovery;
use Sentry\ClientBuilder;
use Sentry\HttpClient\HttpClientFactory;
use Sentry\HttpClient\HttpClientFactoryInterface;
use Sentry\Transport\HttpTransport;
use Sentry\SentrySdk;
use Sentry\Transport\TransportFactoryInterface;

$httpClientFactory = new HttpClientFactory(
    UriFactoryDiscovery::find(),
    MessageFactoryDiscovery::find(),
    StreamFactoryDiscovery::find(),
    HttpAsyncClientDiscovery::find(),
    'sentry.php',
    '2.3'
);

$transportFactory = new class($httpClientFactory) implements TransportFactoryInterface  {
    /**
     * @var HttpClientFactoryInterface
     */
    private $clientFactory;

    public function __construct(HttpClientFactoryInterface $clientFactory)
    {
        $this->clientFactory = $clientFactory;
    }

    public function create(\Sentry\Options $options): \Sentry\Transport\TransportInterface
    {
        return new HttpTransport($options, $this->clientFactory->create($options), MessageFactoryDiscovery::find());
    }
};


$builder = ClientBuilder::create(['dsn' => '___PUBLIC_DSN___']);
$builder->setTransportFactory($transportFactory);

SentrySdk::getCurrentHub()->bindClient($builder->getClient());
```
