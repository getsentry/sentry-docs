<Note>

Profiling for PHP is supported with Sentry PHP SDK version `3.15.0` and above.

</Note>
With [profiling](/product/profiling/), Sentry allows you to collect and analyze performance profiles from real users in production to give you a complete picture of how your application performs in a variety of environments.

Under the hood, we're using Wikipedia's sampling profiler [Excimer](https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-php-excimer).
The Excimer PHP extension does support PHP 7.2 and up, for PHP 8.2 support, make sure to use Excimer version 1.1.0.

**Excimer requires Linux and does not support Windows or macOS.**

## Installation

### Linux package manager

```bash
apt-get install php-excimer
```

See https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Excimer for additional distributions.

### PECL

```bash
pecl install excimer
```

See https://pecl.php.net/package/excimer for more information.

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-php-excimer.git

cd excimer/
phpize && ./configure && make && sudo make install
```

Depending on your environment, you may need to enable the Excimer extension afterwards.

```
phpenmod -s fpm excimer
# or
phpenmod -s apache2 excimer
```

## Enable Performance Monitoring

Profiling depends on Sentry's performance monitoring product being enabled beforehand.
In order to capture profiling data, you need to start a transaction.
Check out the <PlatformLink to="/performance/">performance setup</PlatformLink> and <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation/">custom instrumentation</PlatformLink> documentation for more detailed information.

```php
\Sentry\init([
    'dsn' => '___DSN___',
    'traces_sample_rate' => 1.0,
]);
```

## Enabling Profiling

```php
\Sentry\init([
    'dsn' => '___DSN___',
    'traces_sample_rate' => 1.0,
    // Set a sampling rate for profiling - this is relative to traces_sample_rate
    'profiles_sample_rate' => 1.0,
]);
```
## Improve Response Time

Response time is somewhat impacted when you use the performance capabilities in your PHP application, (depending on the `traces_sample_rate` you've configured). This is due to the nature of PHP, where requests are usually sent as part of the process in which you serve your users' response. This affects the time it takes to send a request to Sentry because it's added to your servers' response time.

To account for this and reduce this addition to close to zero, you can use [Relay](/product/relay/getting-started/) running locally on the same machine or local network that acts as a proxy/agent. As a result, instead of your PHP process sending things to Sentry, the PHP process sends it to your local Relay, which then forwards it to Sentry.

To begin using Relay, check out our docs for [getting started](/product/relay/getting-started/).
Currently, we recommend using Relay in `managed` mode (which is the default).

Follow the instructions in the Relay docs to send a test event through Relay to Sentry.
Don't forget to update your `DSN` to point to your running Relay instance.
After you've set up Relay, you should see a dramatic improvement in how much your server is impacted.

## Troubleshooting

If you don't see any profiling data in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io), you can try the following:

- Ensure that performance monitoring <PlatformLink to="/performance/">is enabled</PlatformLink>.
- Ensure that the <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation">custom instrumentation</PlatformLink> is sending performance data to Sentry by going to the **Performance** page in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).
