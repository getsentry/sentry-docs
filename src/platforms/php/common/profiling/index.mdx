<Note>

Profiling is currently in beta. Beta features are still in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony. If you have any questions or feedback, please email us at [profiling@sentry.io](mailto:profiling@sentry.io).

</Note>

With [profiling](/product/profiling/), Sentry allows you to collect and analyze performance profiles from real users in production to give you a complete picture of how your application performs in a variety of environments.

Under the hood, we're using Wikipedia's sampling profiler [Excimer](https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-php-excimer).
The Excimer PHP extension does support PHP 7.2 and up, for PHP 8.2 support, make sure to use Excimer version 1.1.0.

**Excimer requires Linux and does not support Windows or macOS.**

## Installation

### Linux package manager

```bash
apt-get install php-excimer
```

See https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Excimer for additional distributions.

### PECL

```bash
pecl install excimer
```

See https://pecl.php.net/package/excimer for more information.

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-php-excimer.git

cd excimer/
phpize && ./configure && make && sudo make install
```

Depending on your environment, you may need to enable the Excimer extension afterwards.

```
phpenmod -s fpm excimer
# or
phpenmod -s apache2 excimer
```

## Enable Performance Monitoring

Profiling depends on Sentry's performance monitoring product being enabled beforehand.
Check out the <PlatformLink to="/performance/">performance setup</PlatformLink> and <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation/">custom instrumentation</PlatformLink> documentation for more detailed information.

```php
\Sentry\init([
    'dsn' => '__DSN__',
    'traces_sample_rate' => 1.0,
]);
```

## Enabling Profiling

<Note>
  
Profiling for PHP is supported from Sentry PHP SDK version 3.15.0 and above.

</Note>

```php
\Sentry\init([
    'dsn' => '__DSN__',
    'traces_sample_rate' => 1.0,
    // Set a sampling rate for profiling - this is relative to traces_sample_rate
    'profiles_sample_rate' => 1.0,
]);
```

## Troubleshooting

If you don't see any profiling data in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io), you can try the following:

- Ensure that performance monitoring <PlatformLink to="/performance/">is enabled</PlatformLink>.
- Ensure that the automatic instrumentation is sending performance data to Sentry by going to the **Performance** page in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).
- If the automatic instrumentation is not sending performance data, try using <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation">custom instrumentation</PlatformLink>.
