<Note>

Profiling is currently in beta. Beta features are still in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony. If you have any questions or feedback, please email us at [profiling@sentry.io](mailto:profiling@sentry.io).

</Note>

With [profiling](/product/profiling/), Sentry allows you to collect and analyze performance profiles from real users in production to give you a complete picture of how your application performs in a variety of environments.

Under the hood, we're using Wikipedia's sampling profiler [Excimer](https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-php-excimer).
The Excimer PHP extension does support PHP 7.2 and up, for PHP 8.2 support, make sure to use Excimer version 1.1.0.
There is currently no support for either Windows or macOS.

## Installation

### Linux package manager

```bash
apt-get install php-excimer
```

See https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Excimer for additional distributions.

### PECL

```bash
pecl install excimer
```

See https://pecl.php.net/package/excimer for more information.

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-php-excimer.git

cd excimer/
phpize && ./configure && make && sudo make install
```

Depending on your environment, you may need to enable the Excimer extension afterwards.

```
phpenmod -s fpm excimer
# or
phpenmod -s apache2 excimer
```

## Enable Performance Monitoring

Profiling depends on Sentry's performance monitoring product being enabled beforehand.
Check out the <PlatformLink to="/performance/">performance setup</PlatformLink> and <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation/">custom instrumentation</PlatformLink> documentation for more detailed information.

```php
\Sentry\init([
    'dsn' => '__DSN__',
    'traces_sample_rate' => 1.0,
]);
```

## Enabling Profiling

<Note>
  
Profiling for PHP is supported from Sentry PHP SDK version 3.15.0 and above.

</Note>

```php
\Sentry\init([
    'dsn' => '__DSN__',
    'traces_sample_rate' => 1.0,
    // Set a sampling rate for profiling - this is relative to traces_sample_rate
    'profiles_sample_rate' => 1.0,
]);
```
