The PHP SDK is configurable using a variety of options. These options are set when the SDK is first initialized, passed to the `init()` as an array:

```php
Sentry\init([
  'dsn' => '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
  'max_breadcrumbs' => 100 
]);
```

These options can be read from `$_SERVER` variable - `SENTRY_DSN`, `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT`, `SENTRY_RELEASE` - are read automatically.

`dsn`

: The *DSN* tells the SDK where to send the events. If this value is not provided, the SDK will try to read it from the `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable. If that variable also does not exist, the SDK will not send any events. In runtimes without a process environment (such as the browser SDK), the fallback of reading from the environment variable does not apply.

`release`

: Sets the release. If this value is not provided, the SDK will try to read it from the `SENTRY_RELEASE` environment variable, but it's best to set it manually to guarantee that the release is in sync with your deploy integrations or source map uploads. Release names are strings, but some formats are detected by Sentry and might be rendered differently. Learn more about how to send release data so Sentry can tell you about regressions between releases and identify the potential source in [the releases documentation](/workflow/releases/).

`environment`

: Sets the environment. This string is freeform and not set by default. A release can be associated with more than one environment to separate them in the Sentry web UI (for example, `staging` as compared to `prod` or similar). By default the SDK will try to read this value from the `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable. Note that the variable for `@sentry/browser` is `window.SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT`.

`sample_rate`

: Configures the sample rate as a percentage of events to be sent in the range of `0.0` to `1.0`. The default is `1.0` which means that 100% of events are sent. If set to `0.1` only 10% of events will be sent. Events are picked randomly.

`traces_sample_rate`

: Configures the sample rate as a percentage of transactions to be sent in the range of `0.0` to `1.0`. The default is `0.0` which means Tracing of the SDK is disbaled. If set to `0.1` only 10% of transactions will be sent. Transactions are picked randomly.

`send_default_pii`

: Tells the SDK to collect Cookies and Headers from requests. Defaults to `false`.

`max_breadcrumbs`

: This variable controls the total amount of breadcrumbs that should be captured. This variable defaults to `100`.

`attach_stacktrace`

: When enabled, stack traces are automatically attached to all messages logged. Stack traces are always attached to exceptions; however, when this option is set, stack traces are also sent with messages. This option, for instance, means that stack traces appear next to all log messages. This feature is `off` by default. Grouping in Sentry is different for events with stack traces and without. As a result, you will get new groups as you enable or disable this flag for certain events.

`context_lines`

: This option sets the number of lines of code context to capture. If `null` is set as the value, no source code lines will be added to each stack trace frame. By default this option is set to `3`.

`enable_compression`

: If this option is enabled, `gzip` compression will be enabled. Default is `true`.

`error_types`

: This option accepts an int bitmask like the native PHP function [`error_reporting`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.error-reporting.php). This value is used in the default `ErrorListenerIntegration` to filter out errors: the default value will send all errors (same as setting `E_ALL`); if you want to exclude some types of errors, you just need to apply the right bitmask.  For example, if you want to get all errors but exclude notices and deprecations, the right bitmask to apply is `E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE & ~E_DEPRECATED`.

`in_app_exclude`

: This option configures the list of paths to exclude from the `app_path` detection.

`excluded_exceptions`

: Sometimes you may want to skip capturing certain exceptions. This option sets the FQCN of the classes of the exceptions that you don't want to capture. The check is done using the `instanceof` operator against each item of the array and if at least one of them passes the event will be discarded. Note that this behavior applies to the `captureException` function/method, which is also used in the automatic capture of errors; it's not applied to the `captureEvent` function/method instead, that could be used as a manual override.

`prefixes`

: This option sets the list of prefixes which should be stripped from the filenames to create relative paths.

`project_root`

: The root of the project source code. As Sentry is able to distinguish project
files from third-party ones (e.g. vendors), this option can be configured to
mark the directory containing all the source code of the application.

For example, assuming that the directory structure shown below exists, marking
the project root as `project-folder/src/` means that every file inside that
directory that is part of a stack trace frame will be marked as "application
code".

```
    project-folder/
    ├── vendor/
        ├── foo/
    ├── src/
        ├── bar/ <-- these are going to be marked as application files
```

`send_attempts`

: The number of attempts that should be made to send an event before erroring and dropping it from the queue. By default this option is set to `6`.

`capture_silenced_errors`

: This option enables capturing errors which were silenced using the `@` operator in your source code. Defaults to `false`.

`max_request_body_size`

: This option represents the size limit in bytes beyond which the body of the request is not captured. The default value is `medium`. Possible values are `none` = never send body, `small`, `medium`, `always` = always send the body, no matter how large it is. The values are chosen like this on purpose since the SDK internally can define what the exact limits are.

`max_value_length`

: Determines the maximum value for some fields in the payload we send to Sentry. Defaults to `1024`.

## Integration Configuration

For many platform SDKs integrations can be configured alongside it. On some platforms that happen as part of the `init()` call, in some others, different patterns apply.

`integrations`

: In PHP, the integrations are configured through this parameter on library initialization.

`defaultIntegrations`

: This can be used to disable integrations that are added by default. When set to `false` no default integrations are added.

## Hooks

These options can be used to hook the SDK in various ways to customize the reporting of events.

`before_send`

: This function is called with an SDK-specific event object, and can return a modified event object or nothing to skip reporting the event. Use this hook, for instance, for manual PII stripping before sending.

`before_breadcrumb`

: This function is called with an SDK-specific breadcrumb object before the breadcrumb is added to the scope. When nothing is returned from the function, the breadcrumb is dropped. To pass the breadcrumb through, return the first argument, which contains the breadcrumb object. The callback typically gets a second argument (called a “hint”) that contains the original object from which the breadcrumb was created to further customize what the breadcrumb should look like.

## Transport Options

Transports are used to send events to Sentry. Transports can be customized to some degree to better support highly specific deployments.

`transport`

: Switches out the transport used to send events. In JavaScript for example, it can be used to capture events.

`http_proxy`

: Depending on the configured Transport, set a proxy domain/url for all requests.
