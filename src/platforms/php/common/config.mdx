The PHP SDK provides some non-standard Sentry configuration. All options can be passed into `init()`.

## `capture_silenced_errors`

<Alert level="notice" title=""><markdown>

This option was introduced in version 2.0.1

</markdown></Alert>

This option enables capturing errors which were silenced using the `@` operator
in your source code. Defaults to `false`.

## `context_lines`

This option sets the number of lines of code context to capture. If `null` is
set as the value, no source code lines will be added to each stack trace frame.
By default this option is set to `3`.

## `enable_compression`

If this option is enabled, `gzip` compression will be enabled. Default is `true`.

## `error_types`

This option accepts an int bitmask like the native PHP function [`error_reporting`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.error-reporting.php).
This value is used in the default `ErrorListenerIntegration` to filter out errors:
the default value will send all errors (same as setting `E_ALL`); if you want to
exclude some types of errors, you just need to apply the right bitmask.

For example, if you want to get all errors but exclude notices and deprecations,
the right bitmask to apply is `E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE & ~E_DEPRECATED`.

## `in_app_exclude`

This option configures the list of paths to exclude from the `app_path` detection.

## `excluded_exceptions`

Sometimes you may want to skip capturing certain exceptions. This option sets
the FQCN of the classes of the exceptions that you don't want to capture. The
check is done using the `instanceof` operator against each item of the array
and if at least one of them passes the event will be discarded.

Note that this behavior applies to the `captureException` function/method, which
is also used in the automatic capture of errors; it's not applied to the `captureEvent`
function/method instead, that could be used as a manual override.

## `prefixes`

This option sets the list of prefixes which should be stripped from the filenames
to create relative paths.

## `project_root`

The root of the project source code. As Sentry is able to distinguish project
files from third-party ones (e.g. vendors), this option can be configured to
mark the directory containing all the source code of the application.

For example, assuming that the directory structure shown below exists, marking
the project root as `project-folder/src/` means that every file inside that
directory that is part of a stack trace frame will be marked as "application
code".

```
    project-folder/
    ├── vendor/
        ├── foo/
    ├── src/
        ├── bar/ <-- these are going to be marked as application files
```

## `send_attempts`

The number of attempts that should be made to send an event before erroring
and dropping it from the queue.
By default this option is set to `6`.

## `max_request_body_size`

This option represents the size limit in bytes beyond which the body of the request is not captured. The default value is `medium`. Possible values are `none` = never send body, `small`, `medium`, `always` = always send the body, no matter how large it is.
The values are chosen like this on purpose since the SDK internally can define what the exact limits are.
