title: Config
---

In addition to the [configuration available in the PHP SDK](../configuration/options/), there are some Symfony-specific options.

All configuration for Symfony is done in `app/config/config.yml`.

N.B. The `register_error_listener` and `monolog` configuration options are available since [sentry/sentry-symfony:^3.2.0](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-symfony/releases/tag/3.2.0)

```yaml {filename:app/config/config.yml}
sentry:
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
  register_error_listener: true
  monolog:
    error_handler:
      enabled: false
      level: DEBUG
      bubble: true
  options:
    attach_stacktrace: true
    before_breadcrumb: "@sentry.callback.before_breadcrumb"
    before_send: "@sentry.callback.before_send"
    capture_silenced_errors: false
    context_lines: 5
    default_integrations: true
    enable_compression: true
    environment: "%kernel.environment%"
    error_types: "E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE"
    http_proxy: "10.0.0.12:3456"
    in_app_exclude:
      - "%kernel.cache_dir%"
      - "%kernel.project_dir%/vendor"
    integrations:
      - "@sentry.integration.my_custom_integration"
    excluded_exceptions:
      - 'My\Exceptions\IgnorableException'
    logger: "php"
    max_breadcrumbs: 50
    max_value_length: 2048
    prefixes:
      - "/local_dir/"
    project_root: "%kernel.project_dir%"
    release: "abcde12345"
    sample_rate: 1
    send_attempts: 3
    send_default_pii: true
    server_name: "www.example.com"
    tags:
      tag1: "value1"
      tag2: "value2"
  listener_priorities:
    request: 1
    subrequest: 1
    console: 1
```

The DSN option is the only required option: it sets the Sentry DSN, and so reports all events to the related project. If it's
left empty, it disables Sentry reporting. Because Sentry enables the bundle in all environments, it's recommended to
disable it in the `test` and `dev` environments.

All the possible configurations under the `options` key map directly to the correspondent options from the base SDK;
you can read more about those in the [general configuration docs](../configuration/),
and on the [PHP specific SDK docs](../config/).

Below you can find additional documentation that is specific to the bundle usage, or information about the sensible default
values that you can use in some cases.

## `before_breadcrumb` and `before_send`

The `before_breadcrumb` and `before_send` options both accept a `callable`; thus, you cannot provide it directly through
a YAML file; the bundle accepts a service reference (starting with `@`), which you can build in your DIC container.

## `environment`

The `environment` option defaults to the same environment of your Symfony application (For example,`dev`, `test`, `prod`...).

## `in_app_exclude`

The `in_app_exclude` option is used to mark files as non belonging to your app's source code in events' stack traces.
In this bundle it has two default values:

- `%kernel.cache_dir%`, to exclude Symfony's cache dir
- `%kernel.project_dir%/vendor`, to exclude Composer's dependencies

## `project_root`

The `project_root` options defaults to `%kernel.project_dir%`.

## `listener_priorities`

The `listener_priorities` options are used to change the priority at which the bundle's listener is called. They all default
to `1`, so they are called just before the default priority of `0`, at which you can easily add your custom listeners.
