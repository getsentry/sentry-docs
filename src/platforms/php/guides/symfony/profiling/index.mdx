<Note>

Profiling for PHP is supported with Sentry Symfony SDK version `4.7.0` and above.

</Note>

With [Profiling](/product/profiling/), Sentry allows you to collect and analyze performance profiles from real users in production to give you a complete picture of how your application performs in a variety of environments.

Under the hood, we're using Wikipedia's sampling profiler [Excimer](https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-php-excimer).
The Excimer PHP extension supports PHP 7.2 and up. Use Excimer version 1.1.0 and above for PHP 8.2.

<Note>

Excimer requires Linux and doesn't support Windows or macOS.

</Note>

## Installation

Here's how to install Excimer with a Linux package manager, PECL, or build from a source.

### Linux Package Manager

```bash
apt-get install php-excimer
```

See https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Excimer for additional distributions.

### PECL

```bash
pecl install excimer
```

See https://pecl.php.net/package/excimer for more information.

### Build From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-php-excimer.git

cd excimer/
phpize && ./configure && make && sudo make install
```

Depending on your environment, you may need to enable the Excimer extension afterwards.

```
phpenmod -s fpm excimer
# or
phpenmod -s apache2 excimer
```

## Enable Performance Monitoring

Sentry's performance monitoring product has to be enabled in order for Profiling to work.
Check out the <PlatformLink to="/performance/">performance setup</PlatformLink> documentation for more detailed information.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml {filename:config/packages/sentry.yaml}
sentry:
    options:
        traces_sample_rate: 1.0
```

## Enable Profiling

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml {filename:config/packages/sentry.yaml}
sentry:
    options:
        traces_sample_rate: 1.0
        # Set a sampling rate for profiling - this is relative to traces_sample_rate
        profiles_sample_rate: 1.0
```

## Improve Response Time

Response time is somewhat impacted when you use the performance capabilities in your Symfony application, (depending on the `traces_sample_rate` you've configured).
If your web server is using FastCGI, our SDK utilizes the [`kernel.terminate` event](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/http_kernel.html#8-the-kernel-terminate-event), which means that the response is sent to the user before the profiling data is sent to Sentry.

If your web server isn't using FastCGI, you can run [Relay](/product/relay/getting-started/) locally on the same machine or a local network that can act as a proxy/agent. Doing this will make the PHP process send requests to your local Relay, which will then forward them to Sentry, instead of sending requests to Sentry directly.

To begin using Relay, check out our docs for [getting started](/product/relay/getting-started/).
We recommend using Relay in `managed` mode (which is the default).

Follow the instructions in the Relay docs to send a test event through Relay to Sentry.
Don't forget to update your `DSN` to point to your running Relay instance.
After you've set up Relay, you should see a dramatic improvement in how much your server is impacted.

## Troubleshooting

If you don't see any profiling data in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io), you can try the following:

- Ensure that performance monitoring <PlatformLink to="/performance/">is enabled</PlatformLink>.
- Ensure that the automatic instrumentation is sending performance data to Sentry by going to the **Performance** page in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).
- If the automatic instrumentation is not sending performance data, try using <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation/">custom instrumentation</PlatformLink>.
