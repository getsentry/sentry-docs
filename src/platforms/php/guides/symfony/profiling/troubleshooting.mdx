If you don't see any profiling data in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io), you can try the following:

- Ensure that performance monitoring <PlatformLink to="/performance/">is enabled</PlatformLink>.
- Ensure that the <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation">custom instrumentation</PlatformLink> is sending performance data to Sentry by going to the **Performance** page in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).
