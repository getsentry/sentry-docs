The Symfony SDK offers integrations to support tracing that are enabled by default. To use them, update to the latest version of the SDK.

If the vendors (DBAL, Cache, Twig, and HTTP client) are installed, `enabled` will be set to `true`, so it's likely that this configuration is the same in your app.

These integrations are hooking into critical paths of the framework and of the vendors. As a result, there may be a performance penalty. If you are updating from a previous version or installing the SDK, you may observe a degradation of your app performance, though it may not be noticeable. If you need to disable tracing, you can do so by setting `enabled` to `false`.

```yaml {filename:config/packages/sentry.yaml}
sentry:
  tracing:
    enabled: true
    dbal: # DB queries
      enabled: true
    cache: # cache pools
      enabled: true
    twig: # templating engine
      enabled: true
    http_client: # Symfony HTTP client
      enabled: true
```

You can adjust the integrations to your needs if you want to disable a specific integration.

## DBAL

This integration supports tracking database queries as Spans. Enabling this option will create Spans for your queries.

It is enabled by default. To disable tracking database queries, set `enabled` to `false`.

```yaml {filename:config/packages/sentry.yaml}
sentry:
  tracing:
    dbal: # DB queries
      enabled: false
```

## Twig

This integration adds distributed tracing for Twig template rendering using Sentry.

It is enabled by default. To disable it, set `enabled` to `false`.

```yaml {filename:config/packages/sentry.yaml}
sentry:
  tracing:
    twig: # templating engine
      enabled: false
```

## Cache

This integration adds support for distributed tracing of cache pools.

It is enabled by default. To disable it, set `enabled` to `false`.

```yaml {filename:config/packages/sentry.yaml}
sentry:
  tracing:
    cache: # cache pools
      enabled: false
```

## HTTP Client

This integration adds support for distributed tracing of the Symfony HTTP client.

It is enabled by default. To disable it, set `enabled` to `false`.

```yaml {filename:config/packages/sentry.yaml}
sentry:
  tracing:
    http_client: # Symfony HTTP client
      enabled: false
```

As the HTTP client tracing is based on Symfony's [TraceableHttpClient](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/558fec00b0fa92dc1499434355e5a35de162bbe7/src/Symfony/Component/HttpClient/TraceableHttpClient.php), you must consider the following:

- Using HTTP client tracing will not execute your requests concurrently.
- To get correct span timings, don't assign the response of the request to a variable if you don't intend to use it.

```php
// Correct way
$this->client->request('GET',
    'https://example.com'
);

// Incorrect way
$response = $this->client->request('GET',
    'https://example.com'
);
```
