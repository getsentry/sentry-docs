In addition to the [configuration available in the PHP SDK](../options/), there are some Symfony-specific options.

All configuration for Symfony is done in `config/packages/sentry.yaml`.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml {filename:config/packages/sentry.yaml}
sentry:
    dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    register_error_listener: true
    options:
        attach_stacktrace: true
        before_breadcrumb: "sentry.callback.before_breadcrumb"
        before_send: "sentry.callback.before_send"
        capture_silenced_errors: false
        context_lines: 5
        default_integrations: true
        enable_compression: true
        environment: "%kernel.environment%"
        error_types: "E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE"
        http_proxy: "10.0.0.12:3456"
        in_app_exclude:
            - "%kernel.build_dir%"
            - "%kernel.cache_dir%"
            - "%kernel.project_dir%/vendor"
        integrations:
            - "sentry.integration.my_custom_integration"
        logger: "php"
        max_breadcrumbs: 50
        max_value_length: 2048
        prefixes:
            - "/local_dir/"
        release: "abcde12345"
        sample_rate: 1
        traces_sample_rate: 0
        traces_sampler: "sentry.callback.traces_sampler"
        send_attempts: 3
        send_default_pii: false
        server_name: "www.example.com"
        tags:
            tag1: "value1"
            tag2: "value2"
```

The DSN option is the only required option: it sets the Sentry DSN, and so reports all events to the related project. If it's
left empty, it disables Sentry reporting. Because Sentry enables the bundle in all environments, it's recommended to
disable it in the `test` and `dev` environments.

All the possible configurations under the `options` key map directly to the correspondent options from the base SDK;
you can read more about those in the [general configuration docs](../options/).

Below you can find additional documentation that is specific to the bundle usage, or information about the sensible default
values that you can use in some cases.

## `environment`

The `environment` option defaults to the same environment of your Symfony application.

## `in_app_exclude`

The `in_app_exclude` option is used to mark files as non belonging to your app's source code in events' stack traces.
In this bundle it has three default values:

- `%kernel.build_dir%`, to exclude Symfony's build dir
- `%kernel.cache_dir%`, to exclude Symfony's cache dir
- `%kernel.project_dir%/vendor`, to exclude Composer's dependencies

## Callables

The `before_breadcrumb`, `before_send`, `before_send_transaction` and `traces_sampler` options accept a `callable`; so, you cannot provide it directly through
a YAML file. The bundle accepts a service reference, which you can build in your DIC container like this:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml {filename:config/packages/sentry.yaml}
sentry:
    options:
        before_send: 'sentry.callback.before_send'

services:
    sentry.callback.before_send:
        class: 'App\Service\Sentry'
        factory: [ '@App\Service\Sentry', 'getBeforeSend' ]
```

The service needed for the `before_breadcrumb` option can be implemented as follows:

```php {filename:src/Service/Sentry.php}
<?php

namespace App\Service;

class Sentry
{
    public function getBeforeSend(): callable
    {
        return function(\Sentry\Event $event, ?\Sentry\EventHint $hint): ?\Sentry\Event {
            return $event;
        };
    }
}
```

## Exclude Some Exceptions

This example shows how to ignore not found exceptions, but you can ignore any exception you want.

1. Declare the integrations:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml {filename:config/packages/sentry.yaml}
sentry:
    options:
        integrations:
            - 'Sentry\Integration\IgnoreErrorsIntegration'
```

2. Configure the list of ignored exceptions:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml {filename:config/services.yaml}
services:
    Sentry\Integration\IgnoreErrorsIntegration:
        arguments:
            $options:
                ignore_exceptions:
                    - Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Exception\NotFoundHttpException
```
