Laravel is supported via a native package, [sentry-laravel](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-laravel).

This guide is for Laravel 8+. We also provide instructions for [other versions](configuration/other-versions/) as well as [Lumen-specific instructions](configuration/other-versions/lumen/).

## Install

Install the `sentry/sentry-laravel` package:

```bash
composer require sentry/sentry-laravel
```

Add Sentry reporting to `App/Exceptions/Handler.php`.

```php {filename:App/Exceptions/Handler.php}
public function register()
{
    $this->reportable(function (Throwable $e) {
        if ($this->shouldReport($e) && app()->bound('sentry')) {
            app('sentry')->captureException($e);
        }
    });
}
```

## Configure

Setup Sentry with this command:

```shell
php artisan sentry:publish --dsn=___PUBLIC_DSN___
```

It creates (`config/sentry.php`) and adds the `DSN` to your `.env` file.

```shell {filename:.env}
SENTRY_LARAVEL_DSN=___PUBLIC_DSN___
```

### Verify with Artisan

You can test your configuration using the provided `artisan` command:

```shell
php artisan sentry:test --transaction
[Sentry] DSN discovered!
[Sentry] Generating test Event
[Sentry] Sending test Event
[Sentry] Transaction sent: b22f130764c940c69d6860c212849d48
[Sentry] Event sent with ID: 4cde238791a9433c8876f4a545d9a95b
```

## Verify with code

You can easily verify that Sentry is capturing errors in your Laravel application by creating a debug route that will throw an exception:

```php
Route::get('/debug-sentry', function () {
    throw new Exception('My first Sentry error!');
});
```

Visiting this route will trigger an exception that will be captured by Sentry.


### Local development and testing

When Sentry is installed in your application it will also be active when you are developing or running tests.

You most likely don't want errors to be sent to Sentry when you are developing or running tests, set the DSN value to `null` to disable sending errors to Sentry.

You can do this by not defining `SENTRY_LARAVEL_DSN` in your `.env` or define it as `SENTRY_LARAVEL_DSN=null`.

If you do leave Sentry enabled when developing or running tests it's possible it has a negative effect on the performance of your application or test suite.

## Performance Monitoring

Set `traces_sample_rate` to a value greater than `0.0` after that, Performance Monitoring will be enabled.

```php {filename:config/sentry.php}
'traces_sample_rate' => 1.0 # be sure to lower this in production to prevent quota issues
```

Performance data is transmitted using a new event type called "transactions", which you can learn about in [Distributed Tracing](/product/sentry-basics/tracing/distributed-tracing/#traces-transactions-and-spans). **To capture transactions, you must install and configure your SDK to set the `traces_sample_rate` option to a nonzero value.** The example configuration above will transmit 100% of captured traces. Be sure to lower this value in production otherwise you could burn through your quota quickly.
