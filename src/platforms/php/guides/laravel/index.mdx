Laravel is supported via a native package, [sentry-laravel](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-laravel).

Sentry supports Laravel 5+.

## Install

Install the `sentry/sentry-laravel` package:

```bash
$ composer require sentry/sentry-laravel
```

If you're on Laravel 5.5 or later the package will be auto-discovered. Otherwise you will need to manually configure it in your `config/app.php`.

```php {filename:config/app.php}
'providers' => array(
    // ...
    Sentry\Laravel\ServiceProvider::class,
),
'aliases' => array(
    // ...
    'Sentry' => Sentry\Laravel\Facade::class,
),
```

Add Sentry reporting to `App/Exceptions/Handler.php`.

**For Laravel 7.x and later:**

```php {filename:App/Exceptions/Handler.php}
public function report(Throwable $exception)
{
    if ($this->shouldReport($exception) && app()->bound('sentry')) {
        app('sentry')->captureException($exception);
    }

    parent::report($exception);
}
```

**For Laravel 5.x and 6.x:**

```php {filename:App/Exceptions/Handler.php}
public function report(Exception $exception)
{
    if ($this->shouldReport($exception) && app()->bound('sentry')) {
        app('sentry')->captureException($exception);
    }

    parent::report($exception);
}
```

## Configure

Run:

```shell
$ php artisan sentry:publish
```

that creates the Sentry configuration file (`config/sentry.php`).

Afterwards, add your DSN to `.env`:

```shell {filename:.env}
SENTRY_LARAVEL_DSN=___PUBLIC_DSN___
```

## Verify Setup

You can easily verify that Sentry is capturing errors in your Laravel application by creating a debug route that will throw an exception:

```php
Route::get('/debug-sentry', function () {
    throw new Exception('My first Sentry error!');
});
```

Visiting this route will trigger an exception that will be captured by Sentry.

### Testing with Artisan

You can test your configuration using the provided `artisan` command:

```shell
$ php artisan sentry:test --transaction
[Sentry] DSN discovered!
[Sentry] Generating test Event
[Sentry] Sending test Event
[Sentry] Sending test Transaction
[Sentry] Event sent with ID: 5e93086e4fa04bfab50e551712f25ad7
```

### Local development

When Sentry is installed in your application it will also be active when you are developing.
If you don't want errors to be sent to Sentry when you are developing, set the DSN value to `null`.

You can do this by not defining `SENTRY_LARAVEL_DSN` in your `.env` or define it as `SENTRY_LARAVEL_DSN=null`.

## Monitor Performance

Set `traces_sample_rate` to a value greater than `0.0` after that, Performance Monitoring will be enabled.

```php {filename:config/sentry.php}
'traces_sample_rate' => 1.0 # be sure to lower this in production to prevent quota issues
```

Performance data is transmitted using a new event type called "transactions", which you can learn about in [Distributed Tracing](/performance-monitoring/distributed-tracing/#traces-transactions-and-spans). **To capture transactions, you must install and configure your SDK to set the `traces_sample_rate` option to a nonzero value.** The example configuration above will transmit 100% of captured traces. Be sure to lower this value in production otherwise you could burn through your quota quickly.
