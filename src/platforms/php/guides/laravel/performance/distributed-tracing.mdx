If you're also using Performance Monitoring for [JavaScript](/platforms/javascript/performance/), you can use a helper function to continue the trace and propagate the trace context started from your backend in order to [connect services](/platforms/javascript/performance/connect-services/#navigation-and-other-xhr-requests). (The trace context contains additional trace-related data that is used for trace-based sampling.)
Add the following line to your blade template rendering the `<head/>` of your page:

```php {filename:app.blade.php}
<head>
...
{!! \Sentry\Laravel\Integration::sentryMeta() !!}
...
</head>
```

This helper function will render two meta tags similar to `<meta name="sentry-trace" content="49879feb76c84743ba5034bd2d3f1ca3-7cb5535c930d4666-1"/>` and `<meta name="baggage" content="sentry-trace_id=49879feb76c84743ba5034bd2d3f1ca3,sentry-sample_rate=0.2,sentry-transaction=my-transaction,sentry-public_key=public,sentry-release=1.0.0,sentry-environment=prod>`. Our JavaScript SDK will pick these up and then continue the trace and propagate the trace context.
As a result, your frontend and your backend are connected by way of the same trace.

Otherwise, other backend services with Performance Monitoring will connect automatically.
