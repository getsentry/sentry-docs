The Laravel SDK automatically instruments your application to capture transactions and adds spans for the following features:

- Views
- Queue jobs
- Database queries
- Redis operations
- Laravel HTTP Client
- GraphQL operations (when using [Lighthouse](https://lighthouse-php.com/))
- [Folio](https://github.com/laravel/folio) page based routes
- [Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/) components

The Laravel SDK is also capable of creating spans for filesystem access operations.
You can enable this feature by wrapping the configuration for all disks
with a call to `Sentry\Laravel\Features\Storage\Integration::configureDisks()`:

```php {filename:config/filesystems.php}
'disks' => Sentry\Laravel\Features\Storage\Integration::configureDisks([
    'local' => [
        'driver' => 'local',
        'root' => storage_path('app'),
        'throw' => false,
    ],

    // ...
], /* enableSpans: */ true, /* enableBreadcrumbs: */ true),
```

Alternatively, you can enable this feature only for select disks:

```php {filename:config/filesystems.php}
'disks' => [
    'local' => [
        'driver' => 'local',
        'root' => storage_path('app'),
        'throw' => false,
    ],

    's3' => Sentry\Laravel\Features\Storage\Integration::configureDisk('s3', [
        // ...
    ], /* enableSpans: */ true, /* enableBreadcrumbs: */ true),
],
```

By default, both spans and breadcrumbs are enabled. You may disable them by passing the second argument, `$enableSpans` or the third argument, `$enableBreadcrumbs`.
