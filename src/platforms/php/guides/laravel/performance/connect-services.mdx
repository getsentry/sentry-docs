If you are also using Performance Monitoring for [JavaScript](/platforms/javascript/performance/) you can use a helper function to continue the trace started from your backend in order to [connect services](/platforms/javascript/performance/connect-services/#navigation-and-other-xhr-requests).
Add the following line to your blade template rendering the `<head/>` of your page:

```php {filename:app.blade.php}
<head>
...
{!! \Sentry\Laravel\Integration::sentryTracingMeta() !!}
...
</head>
```

This helper function will render a meta tag similar to this `<meta name="sentry-trace" content="49879feb76c84743ba5034bd2d3f1ca3-7cb5535c930d4666-1"/>`, which our JavaScript SDK will pick up and continue the trace. Therefore, your frontend and your backend are connected by way of the same trace.

Otherwise, other backend services with Performance Monitoring will connect automatically.
