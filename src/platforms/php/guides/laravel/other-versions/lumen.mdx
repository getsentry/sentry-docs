Laravel is supported using a native package: [sentry-laravel](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-laravel).

This guide is for Laravel Lumen 5+. We also provide instructions for [the latest Laravel](/platforms/php/guides/laravel/) as well as [other versions](/platforms/php/guides/laravel/other-versions/).

## Install

Install the `sentry/sentry-laravel` package:

```bash
composer require "sentry/sentry-laravel:^2.14"
```

Register Sentry in `bootstrap/app.php`:

```php {filename:bootstrap/app.php}
$app->register('Sentry\Laravel\ServiceProvider');

// To enable Sentry Performance Monitoring, the `TracingServiceProvider` has to be registered additionally:
// $app->register('Sentry\Laravel\Tracing\ServiceProvider');

// Sentry must be registered before routes are included
require __DIR__ . '/../app/Http/routes.php';
```

Add Sentry reporting to `app/Exceptions/Handler.php`:

```php {filename:app/Exceptions/Handler.php}
public function report(Exception $exception)
{
    if (app()->bound('sentry') && $this->shouldReport($exception)) {
        app('sentry')->captureException($exception);
    }

    parent::report($exception);
}
```

## Configure

Copy the Sentry configuration file from the vendor directory:

```bash
cp vendor/sentry/sentry-laravel/config/sentry.php config/sentry.php
```

Afterwards, add your DSN to `.env`:

```shell {filename:.env}
SENTRY_LARAVEL_DSN=___PUBLIC_DSN___
```

## Verify

### Verify With Artisan

You can test your configuration using the provided `sentry:test` artisan command:

```shell
php artisan sentry:test
```

### Verify With Code

You can verify that Sentry is capturing errors in your Laravel application by creating a route that will throw an exception:

```php {filename:routes/web.php}
Route::get('/debug-sentry', function () {
    throw new Exception('My first Sentry error!');
});
```

Visiting this route will trigger an exception that will be captured by Sentry.

## Local Development and Testing

When Sentry is installed in your application, it will also be active when you are developing or running tests.

You most likely don't want errors to be sent to Sentry when you are developing or running tests. To avoid this, set the DSN value to `null` to disable sending errors to Sentry.

You can also do this by not defining `SENTRY_LARAVEL_DSN` in your `.env` or by defining it as `SENTRY_LARAVEL_DSN=null`.

If you do leave Sentry enabled when developing or running tests, it's possible for it to have a negative effect on the performance of your application or test suite.
