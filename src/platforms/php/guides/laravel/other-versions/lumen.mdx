Lumen is supported via a native package, [sentry-laravel](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-laravel).

Sentry supports Lumen 5+.

## Install

Install the `sentry/sentry-laravel` package:

```bash
composer require sentry/sentry-laravel
```

Register Sentry in `bootstrap/app.php`:

```php {filename:bootstrap/app.php}
$app->register('Sentry\Laravel\ServiceProvider');

# Sentry must be registered before routes are included
require __DIR__ . '/../app/Http/routes.php';
```

To enable Sentry Perfomance Monitoring, the TracingServiceProvider has to be registered additionally in `bootstrap/app.php`:

```php {filename:bootstrap/app.php}
$app->register('Sentry\Laravel\Tracing\ServiceProvider');
```

Add Sentry reporting to `app/Exceptions/Handler.php`:

```php {filename:app/Exceptions/Handler.php}
public function report(Exception $exception)
{
    if (app()->bound('sentry') && $this->shouldReport($exception)) {
        app('sentry')->captureException($exception);
    }

    parent::report($exception);
}
```
## Configure

Copy the Sentry configuration file from the vendor directory:

```bash
cp vendor/sentry/sentry-laravel/config/sentry.php config/sentry.php
```

Afterwards, add your DSN to `.env`:

```shell {filename:.env}
SENTRY_LARAVEL_DSN=___PUBLIC_DSN___
```

### Verify with Artisan

You can test your configuration using the provided `artisan` command:

```shell
php artisan sentry:test --transaction
[Sentry] DSN discovered!
[Sentry] Generating test Event
[Sentry] Sending test Event
[Sentry] Transaction sent: b22f130764c940c69d6860c212849d48
[Sentry] Event sent with ID: 4cde238791a9433c8876f4a545d9a95b
```

## Verify with code

You can easily verify that Sentry is capturing errors in your Lumen application by creating a debug route that will throw an exception:

```php
Route::get('/debug-sentry', function () {
    throw new Exception('My first Sentry error!');
});
```

Visiting this route will trigger an exception that will be captured by Sentry.
