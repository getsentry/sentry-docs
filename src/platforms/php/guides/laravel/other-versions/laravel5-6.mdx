## Install

Install the `sentry/sentry-laravel` package:

```bash
composer require sentry/sentry-laravel
```

Add Sentry reporting to `App/Exceptions/Handler.php`.

```php {filename:App/Exceptions/Handler.php}
public function report(Exception $exception)
{
    if ($this->shouldReport($exception) && app()->bound('sentry')) {
        app('sentry')->captureException($exception);
    }

    parent::report($exception);
}
```

If you're on Laravel 5.5 or later the package will be auto-discovered. Otherwise you will need to manually configure it in your `config/app.php`.

```php {filename:config/app.php}
'providers' => array(
    // ...
    Sentry\Laravel\ServiceProvider::class,
),
'aliases' => array(
    // ...
    'Sentry' => Sentry\Laravel\Facade::class,
),
```

## Configure

Run:

```shell
php artisan sentry:publish
```

that creates the Sentry configuration file (`config/sentry.php`).

Afterwards, add your DSN to `.env`:

```shell {filename:.env}
SENTRY_LARAVEL_DSN=___PUBLIC_DSN___
```

### Verify with Artisan

You can test your configuration using the provided `artisan` command:

```shell
php artisan sentry:test --transaction
[Sentry] DSN discovered!
[Sentry] Generating test Event
[Sentry] Sending test Event
[Sentry] Transaction sent: b22f130764c940c69d6860c212849d48
[Sentry] Event sent with ID: 4cde238791a9433c8876f4a545d9a95b
```

## Verify with code

You can easily verify that Sentry is capturing errors in your Laravel application by creating a debug route that will throw an exception:

```php
Route::get('/debug-sentry', function () {
    throw new Exception('My first Sentry error!');
});
```

Visiting this route will trigger an exception that will be captured by Sentry.
