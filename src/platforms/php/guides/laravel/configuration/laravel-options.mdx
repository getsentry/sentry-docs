All configuration for Laravel is done in `config/sentry.php`.

## Breadcrumbs

The Laravel integration will create [breadcrumbs](../../enriching-events/breadcrumbs/) for certain events occurring in the framework, the capture of this information can be configured using the following options:

```php {filename:config/sentry.php}
'breadcrumbs' => [
    // Capture Laravel logs. Defaults to `true`.
    'logs' => true,

    // Capture queue job information. Defaults to `true`.
    'queue_info' => true,

    // Capture SQL queries. Defaults to `true`.
    'sql_queries' => true,

    // Capture bindings (parameters) on SQL queries. Defaults to `false`.
    'sql_bindings' => false,
],
```

## Performance

To enable performance monitoring, set this to a value greater than `0.0`:

```php {filename:config/sentry.php}
'traces_sample_rate' => 1.0 # be sure to lower this in production to prevent quota issues
],
```
