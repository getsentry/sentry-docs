All configuration for Laravel is done in `config/sentry.php`.

## Breadcrumbs

The Laravel integration will create [breadcrumbs](../../enriching-events/breadcrumbs/) for certain events occurring in the framework, the capture of this information can be configured using the following options:

```php {filename:config/sentry.php}
'breadcrumbs' => [
    // Capture Laravel logs in breadcrumbs
    'logs' => true,

    // Capture SQL queries in breadcrumbs
    'sql_queries' => true,

    // Capture bindings on SQL queries logged in breadcrumbs
    'sql_bindings' => true,

    // Capture queue job information in breadcrumbs
    'queue_info' => true,

    // Capture command information in breadcrumbs
    'command_info' => true,
],
```

## Performance

To enable performance monitoring, set this to a value greater than `0.0`:

```php {filename:config/sentry.php}
// Be sure to lower this in production to prevent quota issues
'traces_sample_rate' => 1.0,
```

## Controller base namespace

Performance monitoring and router breadcrumbs can report the controller classname that handled the request.

These names are generally longer than needed, that's why we strip away the base namespace that is the same for all controller classes.

In Laravel this is `App\Http\Controllers` by default but you can override this using the `controllers_base_namespace` option:

```php {filename:config/sentry.php}
'controllers_base_namespace' => env('SENTRY_CONTROLLERS_BASE_NAMESPACE', 'App\\Http\\Controllers'),
```
