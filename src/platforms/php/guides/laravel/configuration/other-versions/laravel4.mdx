Install the `sentry/sentry-laravel` package:

<Note>

Laravel 4.x is supported until version 0.8.x of the `sentry/sentry-laravel` package.

</Note>

```shell
composer require sentry/sentry-laravel
```

Add the Sentry service provider and facade in `config/app.php`:

```php {filename:config/app.php}
'providers' => array(
    // ...
    'Sentry\SentryLaravel\SentryLaravelServiceProvider',
),
'aliases' => array(
    // ...
    'Sentry' => 'Sentry\SentryLaravel\SentryFacade',
)
```

Create the Sentry configuration file (`config/sentry.php`):

```bash
php artisan config:publish sentry/sentry-laravel
```

Add your DSN to `config/sentry.php`:

```php {filename:config/sentry.php}
<?php

return array(
    'dsn' => '___PUBLIC_DSN___',

    // ...
);
```

If you wish to wire up Sentry anywhere outside of the standard error handlers, or
if you need to configure additional settings, you can access the Sentry instance
through `$app`:

```php
$app['sentry']->setRelease(Git::sha());
```
