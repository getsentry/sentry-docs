Lumen is supported via a native package, [sentry-laravel](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-laravel).

Sentry supports Lumen 5+.

Install the `sentry/sentry-laravel` package:

```bash
composer require sentry/sentry-laravel
```

Register Sentry in `bootstrap/app.php`:

```php {filename:bootstrap/app.php}
$app->register('Sentry\Laravel\ServiceProvider');

# Sentry must be registered before routes are included
require __DIR__ . '/../app/Http/routes.php';
```

Add Sentry reporting to `app/Exceptions/Handler.php`:

```php {filename:app/Exceptions/Handler.php}
public function report(Exception $exception)
{
    if (app()->bound('sentry') && $this->shouldReport($exception)) {
        app('sentry')->captureException($exception);
    }

    parent::report($exception);
}
```

Create the Sentry configuration file (`config/sentry.php`):

```php {filename:config/sentry.php}
<?php

return array(
    'dsn' => '___PUBLIC_DSN___',

    // capture release as git sha
    // 'release' => trim(exec('git log --pretty="%h" -n1 HEAD')),
);
```
