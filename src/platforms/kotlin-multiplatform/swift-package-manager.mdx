Swift Package Manager is a powerful tool for managing dependencies in Swift that allows developers to enjoy a more native integration experience with Xcode.
If you already use Swift Package Manager or prefer it over other package managers on Apple platforms, this guide will show you how to install the Kotlin Multiplatform SDK using Swift Package Manager.

## Prerequisites

Ensure compatibility in Kotlin Multiplatform projects targeting Cocoa by using the version of the Cocoa SDK specified in our [Cocoa SDK Version Compatibility Table](/platforms/kotlin-multiplatform/#cocoa-sdk-version-compatibility-table).

## Install

Add the Sentry Cocoa SDK as a package in Xcode in your iOS app via **File > Add Packages**.
Enter the Git repo URL in the search field:

```text
https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa.git
```

Define your dependency rule to have the exact version `8.17.2` and then click the "Add Package" button.

Alternatively, if your project uses a `Package.swift` file to manage dependencies, you can specify the target with:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
.package(url: "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa", from: "8.17.2"),
```

Next, install the Kotlin Multiplatform SDK and setup your Apple targets by adding the following to your `build.gradle.kts` file in your shared module:

```kotlin {filename:shared/build.gradle.kts}
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

kotlin {
  listOf(
    iosX64(),
    iosArm64(),
    iosSimulatorArm64()
  ).forEach {
    it.binaries.framework {
        baseName = "shared"
        isStatic = true // currently available only as static framework
    }
  }

  sourceSets {
    val commonMain by getting {
      dependencies {
        implementation("io.sentry:sentry-kotlin-multiplatform:{{@inject packages.version('sentry.kotlin.kmp', '0.0.1-alpha.2') }}")
      }
    }

    // Apple targets:
    val iosMain by getting {
      dependsOn(commonMain)
    }

    // Other targets...
  }
}
```

## Current Limitations

- SPM can only be used if the Kotlin Multiplatform framework is exported as static framework.
  - This could also lead to problems using SwiftUI previews as they typically don't work with static frameworks.
