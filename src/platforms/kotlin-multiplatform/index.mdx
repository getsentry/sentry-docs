## Install

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your applicationâ€™s runtime.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-install" />

## Configure

Configuration should happen as early as possible in your application's lifecycle.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-config" />

## Verify

This snippet includes an intentional error, so you can test that everything is working as soon as you set it up.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-verify" />

<Note>

Learn more about manually capturing an error or message in our <PlatformLink to="/usage/">Usage documentation</PlatformLink>.

</Note>

To view and resolve the recorded error, log into [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and open your project. Clicking on the error's title will open a page where you can see detailed information and mark it as resolved.
