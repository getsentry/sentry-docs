## Prerequisites

Ensure compatibility in Kotlin Multiplatform projects targeting Cocoa by using the version of the Cocoa SDK specified in our [Cocoa SDK Version Compatibility Table](/platforms/kotlin-multiplatform/install/#cocoa-sdk-version-compatibility)

## Install

To install the Kotlin Multiplatform SDK and setup your Apple targets with Cocoapods, you need to add the following to your `build.gradle.kts` file in your shared module:

```kotlin {filename:shared/build.gradle.kts}
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

kotlin {
  iosX64()
  iosArm64()
  iosSimulatorArm64()

  sourceSets {
    val commonMain by getting {
      dependencies {
        implementation("io.sentry:sentry-kotlin-multiplatform:{{@inject packages.version('sentry.kotlin.kmp', '0.0.1-alpha.2') }}")
      }
    }

    // Other targets...

    // Apple targets:
    val iosMain by getting {
      dependsOn(commonMain)
    }

    cocoapods {
      summary = "Some description for the Shared Module"
      homepage = "Link to the Shared Module homepage"
      ios.deploymentTarget = "14.1"
      podfile = project.file("../iosApp/Podfile")
      // Make sure you use the proper version according to our Cocoa SDK Version Compatibility Table.
      pod("Sentry", "~> 8.17.2")
      framework {
        baseName = "shared"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
