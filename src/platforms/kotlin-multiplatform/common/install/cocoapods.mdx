To install the Kotlin Multiplatform SDK and setup your Apple targets with Cocoapods, you need to add the following to your `build.gradle.kts` file in your shared module:

<Note>
  Kotlin Multiplatform requires using version **8.4.0** of the Sentry Cocoa SDK,
  specifically. Other versions, including newer ones, aren't guaranteed to work.
</Note>

```kotlin {filename:shared/build.gradle.kts}
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

kotlin {
  iosX64()
  iosArm64()
  iosSimulatorArm64()

  sourceSets {
    val commonMain by getting {
      dependencies {
        implementation("io.sentry:sentry-kotlin-multiplatform:{{@inject packages.version('sentry.kotlin.kmp', '0.0.1-alpha.2') }}")
      }
    }

    // Other targets...

    // Apple targets:
    val iosMain by getting {
      dependsOn(commonMain)
    }

    cocoapods {
      summary = "Some description for the Shared Module"
      homepage = "Link to the Shared Module homepage"
      ios.deploymentTarget = "14.1"
      podfile = project.file("../iosApp/Podfile")
      pod("Sentry", "~> 8.4.0")

      framework {
        baseName = "shared"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
