<Note>
  We require using version 8.4.0 of the Sentry Cocoa SDK, as we cannot
  guarantee correctness with other versions.
</Note>

Add the Sentry Cocoa SDK as a package in Xcode in your iOS app via **File > Add Packages**.
Enter the Git repo URL in the search field:

```text
https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa.git
```

Define your dependency rule to have the exact version `8.4.0` and then click the "Add Package" button.

Alternatively, when your project uses a `Package.swift` file to manage dependencies, you can specify the target with:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
.package(url: "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa", from: "8.4.0"),
```

Next, install the Kotlin Multiplatform SDK and setup your Apple targets by adding the following to your `build.gradle.kts` file in your shared module:

```kotlin {filename:shared/build.gradle.kts}
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

kotlin {
  listOf(
    iosX64(),
    iosArm64(),
    iosSimulatorArm64()
  ).forEach {
    it.binaries.framework {
        baseName = "shared"
        isStatic = true // currently available only as static framework
    }
  }

  sourceSets {
    val commonMain by getting {
      dependencies {
        implementation("io.sentry:sentry-kotlin-multiplatform:{{@inject packages.version('sentry.kotlin.kmp', '0.0.1-alpha.2') }}")
      }
    }

    // Apple targets:
    val iosMain by getting {
      dependsOn(commonMain)
    }

    // Other targets...
  }
}
```
