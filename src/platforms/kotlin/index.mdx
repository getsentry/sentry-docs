Sentry supports JVM related use of Kotlin with our [Java](/platforms/java) SDK, and, for Android applications, with our [Android](/platforms/android) platform.

Select your platform to get started:

- [Java](/platforms/java)
- [Android](/platforms/android)

## Using Sentry SDK with Coroutines

Sentry SDK for Java stores the scope and the context in a thread-local variable. To make sure that a coroutine has access to correct Sentry context, an instance of `SentryContext` must be provided when launching a coroutine:

```kotlin
import io.sentry.kotlin.SentryContext
import io.sentry.Sentry

launch(SentryContext()) {
  // tag set in parent coroutine is visible to child coroutine
  Sentry.setTag("parent-tag", "value")
  launch() {
    // tag set in child coroutine is not visible in parent coroutine
    Sentry.setTag("child-tag", "value")
  }
}
```

We are also working on an [experimental SDK for Kotlin Multiplatform](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-kotlin-multiplatform). Feedback welcome.
