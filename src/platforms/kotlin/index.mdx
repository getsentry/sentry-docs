Sentry supports JVM related use of Kotlin with our [Java](/platforms/java) SDK, and, for Android applications, with our [Android](/platforms/android) platform.

Select your platform to get started:

- [Java](/platforms/java)
- [Android](/platforms/android)

## Kotlin Extensions

<Note>

Support for Kotlin Coroutines is available as a Beta. Features available in Beta are still in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.

We are also working on an [experimental SDK for Kotlin Multiplatform](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-kotlin-multiplatform). Feedback welcome.
