On this page, we get you up and running with Sentry's Rust SDK.

<Note>

If you don't already have an account and Sentry project established, head over to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/signup/), then return to this page.

</Note>

Using a framework? Take a look at our specific guides to get started.

<GuideGrid platform="rust" />

## Install

To add Sentry to your Rust project, just add a new dependency to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml {filename:Cargo.toml}
[dependencies]
sentry = "{{@inject packages.version('sentry.rust') }}"
```

## Configure

The most convenient way to use this library is the `sentry::init` function, which starts a Sentry client with a default set of integrations, and binds it to the current Hub.

The `sentry::init` function returns a guard that when dropped, will flush Events that weren't yet sent to Sentry. It has a two-second deadline, so application shutdown may be slightly delayed as a result. Be sure to keep the guard or you won't be able to send events.

<SignInNote />

```rust {filename:main.rs}
let _guard = sentry::init(("___PUBLIC_DSN___", sentry::ClientOptions {
    release: sentry::release_name!(),
    ..Default::default()
}));
```

**Important:** Remember your DSN. The DSN (Data Source Name) tells the SDK where to send events. If you forget it you can find it be going to: Settings -> Projects -> Client Keys (DSN) in sentry.io.

### Async Main Function

In a multithreaded application, spawned threads should inherit the Hub from the main thread. In order for that to happen, the Sentry client must be initialized before starting an async runtime or spawning threads. This means you'll have to avoid using macros such as `#[tokio::main]` or `#[actix_web::main]`, because they start the runtime first. So rather than doing this:

```rust {filename:main.rs}
// WRONG
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
let _guard = sentry::init(("___PUBLIC_DSN___", sentry::ClientOptions {
    release: sentry::release_name!(),
    ..Default::default()
}));

// implementation of main
}
```

Do this instead:

```rust {filename:main.rs}
// RIGHT
fn main() {
let _guard = sentry::init(("___PUBLIC_DSN___", sentry::ClientOptions {
    release: sentry::release_name!(),
    ..Default::default()
}));

tokio::runtime::Builder::new_multi_thread()
        .enable_all()
        .build()
        .unwrap()
        .block_on(async {
            // implementation of main
        });
}
```

## Verify Setup

The quickest way to verify Sentry in your Rust application is to cause a panic:

<SignInNote />

```rust {filename:main.rs}
fn main() {
    let _guard = sentry::init(("___PUBLIC_DSN___", sentry::ClientOptions {
        release: sentry::release_name!(),
        ..Default::default()
    }));

    // Sentry will capture this
    panic!("Everything is on fire!");
}
```

## Integrations

_Integrations_ extend the functionality of the SDK for some common frameworks
and libraries.

A list of integrations and their feature flags can be found
[in the integration API docs](https://docs.rs/sentry/0/sentry/integrations/index.html).

<Note>

If you keep debug information files in the produced binary, rather than strip them down or split them,
do not add the `debug_images` integration and the corresponding `debug-images` feature flag,
as it will collide with the built-in debug file processing.
