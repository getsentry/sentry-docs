description: "Learn about using Sentry with Actix Web."

The `sentry-actix` crate adds a middleware for [`actix-web`](https://actix.rs/) that captures errors and report them to `Sentry`.

To use this middleware, configure Sentry then add it to your actix web app as a middleware. Because actix is generally working with non sendable objects and is highly concurrent, this middleware creates a new hub per request. As a result, many of the Sentry integrations, such as breadcrumbs, do not work unless you bind the actix hub.

## Example

In your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml {filename:Cargo.toml}
[dependencies]
sentry = "0.19.0"
sentry-actix = "0.19.0"
```

And your Rust code:

```rust {filename:main.rs}
extern crate actix_web;
extern crate sentry;
extern crate sentry_actix;

use std::env;
use std::io;

use actix_web::{server, App, Error, HttpRequest};
use sentry_actix::SentryMiddleware;

fn failing(_req: &HttpRequest) -> Result<String, Error> {
    Err(io::Error::new(io::ErrorKind::Other, "An error happens here").into())
}

fn main() {
    let _guard = sentry::init("___PUBLIC_DSN___");
    env::set_var("RUST_BACKTRACE", "1");

    server::new(|| {
        App::new()
            .middleware(SentryMiddleware::new())
            .resource("/", |r| r.f(failing))
    }).bind("127.0.0.1:3001")
        .unwrap()
        .run();
}
```

## Reusing the Hub

If you use this integration the `Hub::current()` returned hub is typically the wrong one.
To get the request specific one you need to use the `ActixWebHubExt` trait:

```rust
use sentry::{Hub, Level};
use sentry_actix::ActixWebHubExt;

let hub = Hub::from_request(req);
hub.capture_message("Something is not well", Level::Warning);
```

The hub can also be made current:

```rust
use sentry::{Hub, Level};
use sentry_actix::ActixWebHubExt;

let hub = Hub::from_request(req);
Hub::run(hub, || {
    sentry::capture_message("Something is not well", Level::Warning);
});
```
