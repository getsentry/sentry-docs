description: "Learn about using Sentry with Actix Web."
---

The `sentry-actix` crate adds a middleware for [`actix-web`](https://actix.rs/) that captures errors and report them to `Sentry`.

To use this middleware, configure Sentry then add it to your actix web app as a middleware. Because actix is generally working with non sendable objects and is highly concurrent, this middleware creates a new hub per request. As a result, many of the Sentry integrations, such as breadcrumbs, do not work unless you bind the actix hub.

Note: Macros like `#[tokio::main]` and `#[actix_web::main]` are not supported. The Sentry client must be initialized before the async runtime is started so that all threads are correctly connected to the Hub.

## Example

In your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml {filename:Cargo.toml}
[dependencies]
actix-web = "4.3.1"
sentry = "{{@inject packages.version('sentry.rust') }}"
sentry-actix = "{{@inject packages.version('sentry.rust') }}"
```

And your Rust code:

<SignInNote />

```rust {filename:main.rs}
use std::io;

use actix_web::{get, App, Error, HttpRequest, HttpServer};

#[get("/")]
async fn failing(_req: HttpRequest) -> Result<String, Error> {
    Err(io::Error::new(io::ErrorKind::Other, "An error happens here").into())
}

fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    let _guard = sentry::init((
        "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
        sentry::ClientOptions {
            release: sentry::release_name!(),
            ..Default::default()
        },
    ));
    std::env::set_var("RUST_BACKTRACE", "1");

    actix_web::rt::System::new().block_on(async {
        HttpServer::new(|| {
            App::new()
                .wrap(sentry_actix::Sentry::new())
                .service(failing)
        })
        .bind("127.0.0.1:3001")?
        .run()
        .await
    })?;

    Ok(())
}
```

## Reusing the Hub

When using the actix integration, a new per-request Hub will be created from the main Hub, and will be set automatically as the current Hub (`Hub::current()`).
No manual intervention in needed.
