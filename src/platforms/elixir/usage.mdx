## Capturing Errors

If you use the LoggerBackend and set up the Plug/Phoenix integrations, all errors will bubble up to Sentry.

Otherwise, we provide a simple way to capture exceptions manually:

```elixir
try do
  ThisWillError.really()
rescue
  my_exception ->
    Sentry.capture_exception(my_exception, [stacktrace: __STACKTRACE__, extra: %{extra: information}])
end
```

## Optional Attributes

With calls to `capture_exception` additional data can be supplied as a keyword list:

> ```elixir
> Sentry.capture_exception(exception, opts)
> ```

`extra`

: Additional context for this event. Must be a mapping. Children can be any native JSON type.

```elixir
extra: %{key: "value"}
```

`level`

: The level of the event. Defaults to `error`.

```elixir
level: "warning"
```

Sentry is aware of the following levels:

- debug (the least serious)
- info
- warning
- error
- fatal (the most serious)

`fingerprint`

: The fingerprint for grouping this event.

`tags`

: Tags to index with this event. Must be a mapping of strings.

```elixir
tags: %{"key" => "value"}
```

`user`

: The acting user.

```elixir
user: %{
    "id" => 42,
    "email" => "email@email.com"
}
```

`event_source`

: The source of the event. Used by the `Sentry.EventFilter` [`behaviour`](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/typespecs-and-behaviours.html#behaviours).

## Breadcrumbs

Sentry supports capturing breadcrumbs – events that happened prior to an issue. We need to be careful because breadcrumbs are per-process. If a process dies it might lose its context.

```elixir
Sentry.Context.add_breadcrumb(%{my: "crumb"})
```
