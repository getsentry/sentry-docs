## Migrating from `io.sentry:sentry` `5.x` to `io.sentry:sentry` `6.0.0`

- Kotlin plugin is upgraded to `1.5`.
- Kotlin `languageVersion` is upgraded to `1.4`.
- `Gson` is removed as a transitive dependency and vendored in the SDK.
  - Protocol classes now implement the `JsonSerializable` and `JsonDeserializer` interfaces.
- Spring Boot has been upgraded to `2.5.13`
- `SentryOptions#shutdownTimeout` is renamed to `shutdownTimeoutMillis`.
- Removed `@Deprecated` and `@ApiStatus.ScheduledForRemoval` methods
  - `ITransaction#setRequest`
  - `ITransaction#getRequest`
  - `ITransaction#getContexts`
  - `SentryBaseEvent#getOriginThrowable`
  - `SentryOptions#getCacheDirSize`
  - `SentryOptions#setCacheDirSize`
  - `SentryOptions#isEnableSessionTracking`
  - `SentryOptions#setEnableSessionTracking`
  - `sentry.enable-tracing` property
  - `SentrySpringRequestListener`, `SentrySpringFilter` is used instead.
  - `SentryUserProviderEventProcessor`, please use `SentryUserProvider` instead.
- `SentryOptions#enableScopeSync` is now enabled by default.
- `ISpan` now has higher precision using the `System#nanoTime` instead of milliseconds.
- `TransactionNameProvider` is now an interface and `SpringMvcTransactionNameProvider` is the default implementation.

- Hints changed its type from `Object` to `io.sentry.Hint`

_Old_:

```kotlin
Sentry.captureException(RuntimeException("exception"), "myStringHint")
```

_New_:

```kotlin
val hints = mutableMapOf<String, Any>("myHint" to "myStringHint")
Sentry.captureException(RuntimeException("exception"), hints)
```

- `SentryOptions#sendClientReports` is now enabled by default. To disable it, see [sendClientReports](/platforms/java/configuration/#client-reports). For more information on the option see [sendClientReports](/platforms/java/configuration/options/#send-client-reports).

### Sentry Self-hosted Compatibility

- Starting with version `6.0.0` of `sentry`, [Sentry's version >= v21.9.0](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/releases) is required or you have to manually disable sending client reports via the `sendClientReports` option. This only applies to self-hosted Sentry. If you are using [sentry.io](https://sentry.io), no action is needed.

There are more changes and refactors, but they are not user breaking changes.
