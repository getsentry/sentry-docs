Sentry for Java is a collection of modules provided by Sentry. At its core, Sentry for Java provides a raw client for sending events to Sentry. To begin, we **highly recommend** you use one of the library or framework integrations listed under Installation. Otherwise, [manual usage](/platforms/java/usage/) is another option.
