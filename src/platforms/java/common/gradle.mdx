The [Sentry Gradle Plugin](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-android-gradle-plugin) is an addition to the main Java SDK and offers
seamless integration with the Gradle build system. It supports the reporting of your application's external dependencies as part of events.

## Setup

### Install

Using Gradle in your application module's `build.gradle` add:

```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
}

plugins {
    id "io.sentry.android.gradle" version "{{ packages.version('sentry.java.android.gradle-plugin', '3.0.0') }}"
}
```

```kotlin
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
}

plugins {
    id("io.sentry.android.gradle") version "{{ packages.version('sentry.java.android.gradle-plugin', '3.0.0') }}"
}
```

<Note>

Although the plugin id contains `android`, it can be used for non-android projects. However, for non-android projects, the plugin only collects external dependencies.

</Note>

### Configure

We expose the following configuration values directly in `build.gradle`:

```groovy
sentry {
    // Disables or enables dependencies metadata reporting for Sentry.
    // If enabled, the plugin will collect external dependencies and
    // upload them to Sentry as part of events. If disabled, all the logic
    // related to the dependencies metadata report will be excluded.
    //
    // Default is enabled.
    includeDependenciesReport = true
}
```

```kotlin
sentry {
    // Disables or enables dependencies metadata reporting for Sentry.
    // If enabled, the plugin will collect external dependencies and
    // upload them to Sentry as part of events. If disabled, all the logic
    // related to the dependencies metadata report will be excluded.
    //
    // Default is enabled.
    includeDependenciesReport.set(true)
}
```

## Dependencies Report

The plugin automatically collects an application's external dependencies (including transitive ones), and generates a compile-time report. The Sentry Java SDK picks up the report at runtime and sends it along with every Sentry event. The event dependencies metadata will look something like this:
