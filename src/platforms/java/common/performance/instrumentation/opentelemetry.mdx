<Include name="alpha-note.mdx" />

There are multiple ways of configuring your [OpenTelemetry SDK](https://opentelemetry.io/) to send traces and spans to Sentry.

## Using `sentry-opentelemetry-agent` With Auto Initialization

If you use `sentry-opentelemetry-agent`, it will look for `SENTRY_DSN` and `SENTRY_PROPERTIES_FILE` environment variables to be defined, and then initialize Sentry automatically. Only your `DSN` and `tracesSampleRate` need to be configured.

### Install

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/opentelemetry-install/with-java-agent/with-auto-init" />

### Usage

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/opentelemetry-setup/with-java-agent/with-auto-init" />

### Debugging

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/opentelemetry-setup/with-java-agent/with-auto-init/debugging" />

### Turn Off Exporter Error Messages

## Using `sentry-opentelemetry-agent` Without Auto Initialization

You may also disable automatic initialization of Sentry in `sentry-opentelemetry-agent` by setting `SENTRY_AUTO_INIT=false` as environment variable. This means you will either have to use another Sentry integration that performs initialization, for example Spring Boot, or initialize Sentry manually.

### Usage

### Debugging

### Turn Off Exporter Error Messages

## Using OpenTelemetry Without Any Java Agent

If the Java Agent approach is not for you, you may also manually initialize OpenTelemetry. We have a separate dependency for this use case that allows you to reuse classes used by `sentry-opentelemetry-agent`.

### Install

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/opentelemetry-install/without-java-agent" />

### Usage

You will have to configure both OpenTelemetry and Sentry to see transactions in Sentry and have errors linked to transactions created by OpenTelemetry.
