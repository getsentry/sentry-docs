The Java SDK implements the idea of a “context” to support attaching additional information to events, such as breadcrumbs. A context may refer to a single request to a web framework, to the entire lifetime of an Android application, or something else that better suits your application’s needs.

## Usage

Breadcrumbs can be used to describe actions that occurred in your application leading up to an event being sent. For example, whether external API requests were made, or whether a user clicked on something in an Android application. By default the last 100 breadcrumbs per context will be stored and sent with future events.

The user can be set per context so that you know who was affected by each event.

Once a `Sentry` instance has been initialized you can begin setting state in the current context.

```java
import io.sentry.Sentry;
import io.sentry.protocol.User;

public class MyClass {

  public void example() {
    // Manually initialize the static client, you must also pass in a DSN and/or
    // SentryClientFactory to use. Note that the client will attempt to automatically
    // initialize on the first use of the static API, so this isn't strictly necessary.
    Sentry.init(options -> {
      options.setDsn("https://f7f320d5c3a54709be7b28e0f2ca7081@sentry.io/1808954");
    });

    // Note that all fields set on the context are optional. Context data is copied onto
    // all future events in the current context (until the context is cleared).

    // Set the current user in the context.
    Sentry.configureScope(scope -> {
      User user = new User();
      user.setUsername("user1");
      scope.setUser(user);
    });

    // Record a breadcrumb in the context.
    Sentry.addBreadcrumb("User did something specific again!");

    // Add extra data to future events in this context.
    Sentry.configureScope(scope -> {
      scope.setExtra("extra", "thing");
    });

    // Add an additional tag to future events in this context.
    Sentry.configureScope(scope -> {
      scope.setTag("tagName", "tagValue");
    });

    // Send an event with the context data attached.
    Sentry.captureMessage("New event message");
  }
}
```
