Sentry Java SDK by default comes with a lightweight transport implementation based on [HttpUrlConnection](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/HttpURLConnection.html). While this implementation is a great fit for the error reporting feature, it may provide enough throughput for high traffic, server applications using Sentry's Performance Monitoring.

In a separate module, as an optional dependency, the SDK also provides high-throughput implementation based on Apache HTTP Client 5. To use this module, include following dependency in your project:

```xml {tabTitle:Maven}
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.sentry</groupId>
    <artifactId>sentry-apache-http-client-5</artifactId>
    <version>{{ packages.version('sentry.java.apache-http-client-5', '4.0.0') }}</version>
</dependency>
```

```groovy {tabTitle:Gradle}
implementation 'io.sentry:sentry-apache-http-client-5:{{ packages.version('sentry.java.apache-http-client-5', '4.0.0') }}'
```

```scala {tabTitle:SBT}
libraryDependencies += "io.sentry" % "sentry-apache-http-client-5" % "{{ packages.version('sentry.java.apache-http-client-5', '4.0.0') }}"
```

Then configure SDK to use the new transport:

```java {tabTitle:Java}
import io.sentry.Sentry;
import io.sentry.transport.apache.ApacheHttpClientTransportFactory;

Sentry.init(options -> {
  options.setTransportFactory(new ApacheHttpClientTransportFactory());
});
```

```kotlin {tabTitle:Kotlin}
import io.sentry.Sentry
import io.sentry.transport.apache.ApacheHttpClientTransportFactory

Sentry.init { options ->
  options.transportFactory = ApacheHttpClientTransportFactory()
});
```

Note, `ApacheHttpClientTransport` does not support envelope caching which means that pending events and transactions are discarded on application shutdown.
