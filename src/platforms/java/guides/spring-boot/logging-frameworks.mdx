For the best experience, we recommend using Sentry's Spring Boot integration with one of the logging framework integrations as they work together seamlessly.

### Logback

To use Sentry Logback integration in Spring Boot application you must include a dependency to the `sentry-logback` module, then Sentry's Spring Boot Starter will auto-configure `SentryAppender`:

```xml {tabTitle:Maven}
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.sentry</groupId>
    <artifactId>sentry-logback</artifactId>
    <version>{{ packages.version('sentry.java', '4.0.0') }}</version>
</dependency>
```

```groovy {tabTitle:Gradle}
implementation 'io.sentry:sentry-logback:{{ packages.version('sentry.java', '4.0.0') }}'
```

Minimum logging levels for `SentryAppender` can be configured in `application.properties` or `application.yml` file.

```properties
sentry.logging.minimum-event-level=info
sentry.logging.minimum-breadcrumb-level=debug
```

The default values are:

- `info` or higher to include a log message as breadcrumb.
- `error` or higher will send an event to Sentry.

When `SentryAppender` auto-configuration does not suit your needs, it can be turned off by setting:

```properties
sentry.logging.enabled=false
```

If you decide to opt-out from the `application.properties` based Spring Boot logging configuration, and instead configure logging in the `logback-spring.xml` file, the `SentryAppender` can be configured as follows:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration>
  <include resource="org/springframework/boot/logging/logback/defaults.xml"/>
  <include resource="org/springframework/boot/logging/logback/console-appender.xml" />

  <appender name="SENTRY" class="io.sentry.logback.SentryAppender" />

  <root level="info">
    <appender-ref ref="CONSOLE" />
    <appender-ref ref="SENTRY" />
  </root>
</configuration>
```

<Note>

You do not need to configure your DSN in the Logback configuration file since Sentry is configured from the Spring Boot integration.

However, if errors that may appear during startup should to be sent to Sentry, the DSN must be provided to <i>both</i> the Logback and Spring Boot configurations.

</Note>

### Log4j2

To use Sentry's Log4j2 integration in Spring Boot application, [follow the guide on configuring Log4j2 with Spring Boot](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto.html#howto-configure-log4j-for-logging) and configure `SentryAppender` in the `log4j2.xml` file:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Configuration status="warn" packages="org.apache.logging.log4j.core,io.sentry.log4j2">
    <Appenders>
        <Console name="Console" target="SYSTEM_OUT">
            <PatternLayout pattern="%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%t] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n"/>
        </Console>
        <Sentry name="Sentry" />
    </Appenders>
    <Loggers>
        <Root level="info">
            <AppenderRef ref="Sentry"/>
            <AppenderRef ref="Console"/>
        </Root>
    </Loggers>
</Configuration>
```

<Note>

You do not need to configure your DSN in the Logback configuration file since Sentry is configured from the Spring Boot integration.

However, if errors that may appear during startup should to be sent to Sentry, the DSN must be provided to <i>both</i> the Logback and Spring Boot configurations.
