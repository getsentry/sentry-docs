## Spring MVC Integration

Sentry Spring Boot integration, once enabled, captures each incoming Spring MVC HTTP request and turns it into a transaction with `SentryTracingFilter`. Transaction names follow pattern `<HTTP method> <Spring MVC route>`, for example for a request to a following controller:

```java
@RestController
class HelloController {

    @GetMapping("/person/{id}")
    Person person(@PathVariable Long id) {
        ...
    }
}
```

Each sampled request executed by this controller method will be turned into a transaction `GET /person/{id}`.

## RestTemplate Instrumentation

Sentry Spring Boot integration provides `SentrySpanRestTemplateCustomizer` that creates a span for each outgoing HTTP request executed with a `RestTemplate`. To use instrumented `RestTemplate` make sure to create `RestTemplate` beans using `RestTemplateBuilder`:

```java
@Configuration
class AppConfig {
    @Bean
    RestTemplate restTemplate(RestTemplateBuilder builder) {
        return builder.build();
    }
}
```

## Capturing Bean Method Execution

### Capturing Transaction

Every Spring bean method execution can be turned into a transaction or a span. To enable this feature, you must include `spring-boot-starter-aop` in your application:

```xml {tabTitle:Maven}
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-aop</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Methods executed outside of Spring MVC request processing can be turned into transactions by annotating them with `@SentryTransaction` annotation:

```java
@Component
class ScheduledJob {

    @Scheduled(...)
    @SentryTransaction
    void execute() {
        ...
    }
}
```
`@SentryTransaction` can be configured with custom `name` and `op` properties. If not defined, `name` will be resolved from the class, and the method name.

Advanced Spring AOP users can redefine transaction pointcut by providing a custom `org.springframework.aop.Pointcut` bean with name `sentryTransactionPointcut`.

### Capturing Span

To create a span around a method execution, annotate method with `@SentrySpan` annotation:

```java
@Component
class PersonService {

    @SentrySpan
    Person findById(Long id) {
        ...
    }
}
```

`@SentrySpan` can be configured with custom `description` and `op` properties. If not defined, `description` will be resolved from the class, and the method name.

Advanced Spring AOP users can redefine span pointcut by providing a custom `org.springframework.aop.Pointcut` bean with name `sentrySpanPointcut`.
