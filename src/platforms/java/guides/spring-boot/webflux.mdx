Similar to Spring MVC, Sentry has a support for Spring Webflux. When developing a reactive web application, Sentry Spring Boot Starter creates infrastructure required for capturing errors triggered during HTTP request processing.

<Note>
Webflux support is available from version 5.1.0 in experimental phase. The API as well as internals may change in the future releases.
