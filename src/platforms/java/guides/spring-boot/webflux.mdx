Similar to Spring MVC, Sentry has a support for Spring Webflux. When developing a reactive web application, Sentry Spring Boot Starter creates infrastructure required for capturing errors triggered during HTTP request processing.

<Note>
Support for Spring Webflux is available as a Beta. Features available in Beta are still in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.
