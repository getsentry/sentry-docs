Similar to Spring MVC, Sentry offers support for Spring WebFlux. When developing a reactive web application, Sentry Spring Boot Starter creates the infrastructure required for capturing errors triggered during HTTP request processing.

<Note>
Support for Spring WebFlux is available as a Beta. Features available in Beta are still in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.
