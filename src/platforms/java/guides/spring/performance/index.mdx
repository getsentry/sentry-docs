<Alert level="warning" title="Note">
Performance Monitoring is available for the Sentry Java SDK version â‰¥ 4.0.
</Alert>

Sentry allows you to monitor the performance of your application, showing you how latency in one service may affect another service, and letting you pinpoint exactly which parts of a given operation may be responsible. To do this, it captures distributed traces consisting of transactions and spans, which measure individual services and individual operations within those services, respectively. You can learn more about this model in our [Distributed Tracing](/product/performance/distributed-tracing/) docs.

## Enabling Tracing


<PlatformContent includePath="performance/enable-tracing" />

If either of these options is set, tracing will be enabled in your app, and transactions will start getting captured automatically. (The two options are meant to be mutually exclusive, but if you do set both, <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> will take precedence.)

As you're getting tracing set up, we recommend setting <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> to `1`, so all created transactions are sent to Sentry. Once you're done with testing, though, you'll probably want to consider either **lowering your <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> value, or switching to <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" />**, which will allow you to set the sample rate individually for each transaction. Without sampling, automatically-captured transactions can add up quickly. (The Spring integration, for example, will send a transaction for every request made to the server.) Sampling allows you to send representative data without overwhelming either your system or your Sentry transaction quota.

You can learn more about the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> and <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> options in <PlatformLink to="/performance/sampling/">Sampling Transactions</PlatformLink>.

## Using High-Throughput Transport

For high traffic applications we recommend using high-throughput HTTP transport based on [Apache HTTP Client 5](https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-5.0.x/index.html). Add following dependency `sentry-apache-http-client-5`:

```xml {tabTitle:Maven}
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.sentry</groupId>
    <artifactId>sentry-apache-http-client-5</artifactId>
    <version>{{ packages.version('sentry.java.apache-http-client-5', '4.0.0') }}</version>
</dependency>
```

```groovy {tabTitle:Gradle}
implementation 'io.sentry:sentry-apache-http-client-5:{{ packages.version('sentry.java.apache-http-client-5', '4.0.0') }}'
```

```scala {tabTitle:SBT}
libraryDependencies += "io.sentry" % "sentry-apache-http-client-5" % "{{ packages.version('sentry.java.apache-http-client-5', '4.0.0') }}"
```

Define the bean, which will be automatically used by Sentry SDK:

```java {tabTitle:Java}
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import io.sentry.transport.apache.ApacheHttpClientTransportFactory;

@Bean
public ApacheHttpClientTransportFactory apacheHttpClientTransportFactory() {
    return new ApacheHttpClientTransportFactory();
}
```

```java {tabTitle:Kotlin}
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean
import io.sentry.transport.apache.ApacheHttpClientTransportFactory

@Bean
fun apacheHttpClientTransportFactory() = ApacheHttpClientTransportFactory()
```
