title: Filter Events & Custom Logic
---

Sentry exposes a `before_send` callback which can be used to filter out
information or add additional context to the event object. The callback must
conform to the `sentry_event_function_t` signature.

```c
#include <sentry.h>

sentry_value_t strip_sensitive_data(sentry_value_t event, void *hint) {
  /* modify event here or return NULL to discard the event */
  return event;
}

int main(void) {
  sentry_options_t *options = sentry_options_new();
  sentry_options_set_before_send(options, strip_sensitive_data);
  sentry_init(options);

  /* ... */
}
```

The callback is executed in the same thread as the call to
`sentry_capture_event`. Work performed by the function may thus block the
executing thread. For this reason, consider avoiding heavy work in
`before_send`.

The Crashpad Backend sends Minidumps with an additional event payload
out-of-process. `before_send` hooks are not invoked when capturing crashes
using Crashpad.
