title: Release Health
---

Monitor the [health of releases](/product/releases/health/) by observing user adoption, usage of the application, percentage of [crashes](/product/releases/health/#crash), and [session data](/product/releases/health/#session). Release health will provide insight into the impact of crashes and bugs as it relates to user experience, and reveal trends with each new issue through the release details, graphs, and filters.

A release is a version of your code that you deploy to an environment. When you give Sentry information about your releases, you unlock many new features:

- Determine the issue and regressions introduced in a new release
- Predict which commit caused an issue and who is likely responsible
- Resolve issues by including the issue number in your commit message
- Receive email notifications when your code gets deployed

For more information, see [Releases Are Better With Commits](https://blog.sentry.io/2017/05/01/release-commits.html).

## Configure

To configure the SDK to send release information, set the release during
initialization:

```c
  sentry_options_t *options = sentry_options_new();
  sentry_options_set_release(options, "my-unique-release-1.0.0");
```

To benefit from the health data, you must use at least version 0.4.0 of the Native SDK.
Metrics collection for release health is, by default, enabled, unless you specifically disabled collecting in the initialization options for the SDK.

```c
sentry_options_t *options = sentry_options_new();
// Session tracking is enabled by default. To disable:
sentry_options_set_auto_session_tracking(options, 0);
sentry_init(options);
```

The SDK automatically starts a new session when it is initialized via `sentry_init`, and will end that session automatically when the SDK is shut down via `sentry_shutdown`, or explicitly by calling `sentry_end_session`.
The SDK currently tracks only one concurrent session and will end the running session when using `sentry_start_session`.

For more details, see the [full documentation on Release Health](/product/releases/health/).

## Identification of the User

By default, the SDK will try to use the `id`, `email`, or `username` properties of the object set via `sentry_set_user` as the session’s distinct identifier. While this ID contains personally identifiable information, and is transmitted to the sentry backend, the ID will not persist server-side.
