[Crashpad](https://chromium.googlesource.com/crashpad/crashpad/+/master/README.md)
is an open-source multiplatform crash reporting system written in C++ by Google.
It supports macOS, Windows, and Linux, and features an uploader to
submit Minidumps to a configured URL right when the process crashes.

To use the Crashpad backend with the Native SDK, configure the CMake build
with the `SENTRY_BACKEND=crashpad` option. This will automatically create a
`crashpad_handler` executable alongside the `sentry` library.

```shell
$ cmake -B build -D SENTRY_BACKEND=crashpad
```

The SDK will automatically look for a `crashpad_handler` executable in the same
directory as the running application. It will also use the `.sentry-native`
directory as its database by default, relative to the current working directory
of your application.
This location temporarily hosts Minidumps before they are uploaded to Sentry.

Both of these paths can be customized like this:

```c
sentry_options_t *options = sentry_options_new();
sentry_options_set_handler_path(options, "path/to/crashpad_handler");
sentry_options_set_database_path(options, "sentry-db-directory");
sentry_init(options);
```

The crashpad handler executable must be shipped alongside your application so
that it can be launched when initializing the SDK. The path is evaluated
according to shell lookup rules at runtime.

It is advised to specify both the path to the `crashpad_handler` executable
as well as the path to the database directory manually.

## Known Limitations

When using the Crashpad backend on macOS, the duration and status of crashes sessions can not be reliably determined, and may be classified as [`abnormal`](/product/releases/health/#release-details) exits instead.
