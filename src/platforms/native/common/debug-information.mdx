title: Uploading Debug Information
---

To allow Sentry to fully process native crashes and provide you with
symbolicated stack traces, you need to upload _Debug Information Files_
(sometimes also referred to as _Debug Symbols_ or just _Symbols_). We recommend
uploading debug information during your build or release process.

For all libraries where you'd like to receive symbolication, **you need
to provide debug information**. This includes dependencies and operating system
libraries. If you are not sure which files are required, go to _Project
Settings > Processing Issues_, which shows a list of all the necessary files and
instructions to retrieve them.

In addition to Debug Information Files, Sentry needs _Call Frame Information_
(CFI) to extract accurate stack traces from minidumps of optimized release
builds. CFI is usually part of the executables and not copied to debug symbols.
Unless you are uploading Breakpad symbols, be sure to also include the binaries
when uploading files to Sentry.

For more information on uploading debug information and their supported formats,
see [Debug Information Files](/workflow/debug-files/).
