title: Event Attachments

Besides the Minidump file, Sentry can optionally store additional files uploaded
in the same request, such as log files. Learn more about these in [Attachments](/enriching-error-data/attachments/).

To add an attachment, the path to the file has to be configured when
initializing the SDK. It will monitor the file and upload it along with any event
or crash that is sent to Sentry:

```c
sentry_options_add_attachment(options, "/var/server.log");
```
