title: Context
---

Sentry supports additional context with events. Often this context is shared
among any issue captured in its lifecycle, and includes the following
components:

[**Tags**](#tagging-events)

: Key/value pairs which generate breakdown charts and search filters.

[**Level**](#setting-the-level)

: An event's severity.

[**Fingerprint**](#setting-the-fingerprint)

: A value used for grouping events into issues.

## Tagging Events

Tags are key/value pairs assigned to events that can be used for breaking down
issues or quick access to finding related events.

```c
sentry_set_tag("server_name", "caroline");
```

For more information, see the [Tagging Events section](../enriching-events/tags/) in Context.

### Setting the Level

You can set the severity of an event to one of five values (sorted from most
severe to least severe): `fatal`, `error`, `warning`, `info`, and `debug`. The
default level is `error`.

```c
sentry_set_level(SENTRY_LEVEL_WARNING);
```

### Setting the Fingerprint

Sentry uses a fingerprint to decide how to group errors into issues.

For some very advanced use cases, you can override the Sentry default grouping
using the `fingerprint` attribute. In supported SDKs, this attribute can be
passed with the event information and should be an array of strings.

If you wish to append information, thus making the grouping slightly less
aggressive, you can do that as well by adding the special
string `{{default}}` as one of the items.

For code samples, see [Grouping & Fingerprints](../data-management/event-grouping/).

For more information, see [Aggregate Errors with Custom
Fingerprints](https://blog.sentry.io/2018/01/18/setting-up-custom-fingerprints).

## Advanced Usage

### Advanced Configuration

The Native SDK sets the options when you first initialize the SDK:

```c
sentry_options_t *options = sentry_options_new();

sentry_options_set_environment(options, "Production");
sentry_options_set_release(options, "5fd7a6cd");
sentry_options_set_debug(options, 1);

sentry_init(options);
```
