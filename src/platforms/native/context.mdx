title: Context
---

Sentry supports additional context with events. Often this context is shared
among any issue captured in its lifecycle, and includes the following
components:

**Structured Contexts**

: Structured contexts are typically set automatically.

[**User**](#capturing-the-user)

: Information about the current actor.

[**Tags**](#tagging-events)

: Key/value pairs which generate breakdown charts and search filters.

[**Level**](#setting-the-level)

: An event's severity.

[**Fingerprint**](#setting-the-fingerprint)

: A value used for grouping events into issues.

[**Unstructured Extra Data**](#extra-context)

: Arbitrary unstructured data which the Sentry SDK stores with an event sample.

<Alert level="warning" title="Context Size Limits">

Sentry will try its best to accommodate the data you send it, but large context
payloads will be trimmed or may be truncated entirely. For more details see the
[data handling SDK documentation](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/data-handling/)

</Alert>

Context information is attached to every event until explicitly removed or
overwritten.

## Extra Context

In addition to the structured contexts that Sentry understands, you can send
arbitrary key/value pairs of data which the Sentry SDK will store alongside the
event. These are not indexed, and the Sentry SDK uses them to add additional
information about what might be happening.

`sentry_set_extra` takes the name of the extra value as first parameter, and the
value as `sentry_value_t` as second parameter:

```c
sentry_value_t screen = sentry_value_new_object();
sentry_value_set_by_key(screen, "width", sentry_value_new_int32(1920));
sentry_value_set_by_key(screen, "height", sentry_value_new_int32(1080));
sentry_set_extra("screen_size", screen);
```

## Capturing the User

Sending users to Sentry will unlock many features, primarily the ability to
drill down into the number of users affecting an issue, as well as to get a
broader sense about the quality of the application.

```c
sentry_value_t user = sentry_value_new_object();
sentry_value_set_by_key(user, "id", sentry_value_new_int32(42));
sentry_value_set_by_key(user, "username", sentry_value_new_string("John Doe"));
sentry_set_user(user);
```

Users consist of a few critical pieces of information which are used to
construct a unique identity in Sentry. Each of these is optional, but
one **must** be present for the Sentry SDK to capture the user:

`id`

: Your internal identifier for the user.

`username`

: The user's username. Generally used as a better label than the internal ID.

`email`

: An alternative, or addition, to a username. Sentry is aware of email addresses
and can show things like Gravatars, unlock messaging capabilities, and more.

`ip_address`

: The IP address of the user. If the user is unauthenticated, providing the IP
address will suggest that this is unique to that IP. If available, we will
attempt to pull this from the HTTP request data.

Additionally, you can provide arbitrary key/value pairs beyond the reserved
names, and the Sentry SDK will store those with the user.

## Tagging Events

Tags are key/value pairs assigned to events that can be used for breaking down
issues or quick access to finding related events.

```c
sentry_set_tag("server_name", "caroline");
```

For more information, see the [Tagging Events section](../enriching-events/tags/) in Context.

### Setting the Level

You can set the severity of an event to one of five values (sorted from most
severe to least severe): `fatal`, `error`, `warning`, `info`, and `debug`. The
default level is `error`.

```c
sentry_set_level(SENTRY_LEVEL_WARNING);
```

### Setting the Fingerprint

Sentry uses a fingerprint to decide how to group errors into issues.

For some very advanced use cases, you can override the Sentry default grouping
using the `fingerprint` attribute. In supported SDKs, this attribute can be
passed with the event information and should be an array of strings.

If you wish to append information, thus making the grouping slightly less
aggressive, you can do that as well by adding the special
string `{{default}}` as one of the items.

For code samples, see [Grouping & Fingerprints](../data-management/event-grouping/).

For more information, see [Aggregate Errors with Custom
Fingerprints](https://blog.sentry.io/2018/01/18/setting-up-custom-fingerprints).

## Advanced Usage

### Advanced Configuration

The Native SDK sets the options when you first initialize the SDK:

```c
sentry_options_t *options = sentry_options_new();

sentry_options_set_environment(options, "Production");
sentry_options_set_release(options, "5fd7a6cd");
sentry_options_set_debug(options, 1);

sentry_init(options);
```
