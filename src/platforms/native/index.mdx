The Sentry Native SDK is intended for C and C++. However, since it builds as a
dynamic library and exposes C-bindings, it can be used by any language that
supports interoperability with C, such as the Foreign Function Interface (FFI).

Sentry also offers higher-level SDKs for platforms with built-in support for
native crashes:

- [_Android_](/platforms/android/)
- [_Cocoa_](/clients/cocoa/)
- [_Electron_](/platforms/electron/)

In case you would like to use Sentry with a third-party framework directly
without using the Native SDK, see the following resources:

- [_Google Breakpad_](/platforms/native/breakpad/)
- [_Google Crashpad_](/platforms/native/crashpad/)
- [_Unreal Engine 4_](/platforms/native/ue4/)

The Sentry Native SDK has built-in support for both Google Breakpad and Google
Crashpad, see the [Integrations](#integrations) below.

## Integrating the SDK

The Native SDK currently supports **Windows**, **macOS**, **Linux**, and **Android**.

### Building the SDK

To build the SDK, download the latest release of the SDK from the [Releases
page](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-native/releases).
The SDK is managed as a [CMake] project, which additionally supports several configuration options, such as the backend to use.

For example, `CMake` can be used like this (on macOS):

```shell
# configure the cmake build into the `build` directory, with crashpad (on macOS)
$ cmake -B build -D SENTRY_BACKEND=crashpad
# build the project
$ cmake --build build --parallel
# install the resulting artifacts into a specific prefix
$ cmake --install build --prefix install
# which will result in the following (on macOS):
$ exa --tree install
install
├── bin
│  └── crashpad_handler
├── include
│  └── sentry.h
└── lib
   ├── libsentry.dylib
   └── libsentry.dylib.dSYM
```

[cmake]: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/

### Connecting the SDK to Sentry

After completing the project setup in Sentry, it shows the _Data Source Name_
(DSN). It looks similar to a standard URL, and contains all configuration for
the SDK.

Import and initialize the Sentry SDK early in your application setup:

```c
#include <sentry.h>

int main(void) {
  sentry_options_t *options = sentry_options_new();
  sentry_options_set_dsn(options, "___PUBLIC_DSN___");
  sentry_init(options);

  /* ... */

  // make sure everything flushes
  sentry_shutdown();
}
```

<Alert level="warning" title="Warning"><markdown>

Calling `sentry_shutdown()` before exiting the application is critical. It
ensures that events can be sent to Sentry before execution stops. Otherwise,
event data may be lost.

</markdown></Alert>

Alternatively, the DSN can be passed as `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable during
runtime. This can be especially useful for server applications.

### Verifying Your Setup

Now that SDK setup is complete, verify that all configuration is correct. Start
by capturing a manual event:

```c
sentry_capture_event(sentry_value_new_message_event(
  /*   level */ SENTRY_LEVEL_INFO,
  /*  logger */ "custom",
  /* message */ "It works!"
));
```

Once the event is captured, it will show up on the Sentry dashboard.

## Capturing Events

The Native SDK exposes a _Value API_ to construct values like Exceptions, User
objects, Tags, and even entire Events. There are several ways to create an
event.

### Manual Events

To create and capture a manual event, follow these steps:

1. Create an event value using `sentry_value_new_event`. This internally
   creates an object value and initializes it with common event attributes, like
   a `timestamp` and `event_id`.
2. Add custom attributes to the event, like a `message` or an `exception`.
3. Send the event to Sentry by invoking `sentry_capture_event`.

In a more complex example, it looks like this:

```c
sentry_value_t event = sentry_value_new_event();
sentry_value_set_by_key(event, "message", sentry_value_new_string("Hello!"));

sentry_value_t screen = sentry_value_new_object();
sentry_value_set_by_key(screen, "width", sentry_value_new_int32(1920));
sentry_value_set_by_key(screen, "height", sentry_value_new_int32(1080));

sentry_value_t extra = sentry_value_new_object();
sentry_value_set_by_key(extra, "screen_size", screen);

sentry_value_set_by_key(event, "extra", extra);
sentry_capture_event(event);
```

For the full list of supported values, see [_Event Payloads_](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/event-payloads/) and linked
documents.

### Exceptions

To capture an error or exception condition, create events containing an
exception object. It needs to contain at least a value and type:

```c
#include <sentry.h>

sentry_value_t exc = sentry_value_new_object();
sentry_value_set_by_key(exc, "type", sentry_value_new_string("Exception"));
sentry_value_set_by_key(exc, "value", sentry_value_new_string("Error message."));

sentry_value_t event = sentry_value_new_event();
sentry_value_set_by_key(event, "exception", exc);
sentry_capture_event(event);
```

This exception does not contain a stack trace, which must be added separately.

### Message Events

To simplify creating events, there are shorthand functions that construct
prepopulated event objects. The most important one is
`sentry_value_new_message_event`. The `logger` and `message` parameters are each
optional.

```c
sentry_value_t event = sentry_value_new_message_event(
  /*   level */ SENTRY_LEVEL_INFO,
  /*  logger */ "custom",
  /* message */ "It works!"
);
```

### Application Crashes

By default, the Native SDK intercepts crash signals and unhandled exceptions to
send crash reports to Sentry. Depending on the [backend](#integrations), the
crash report can be sent as a conventional event or as a native crash report
file. On Windows, Linux, and macOS, the default backends send binary Minidump
files. Sentry processes them to extract stack traces and exception information
into a readable crash report.

For more information on Minidumps and the limits that apply, see
[What is a Minidump](/platforms/native/minidumps#what-is-a-minidump).

<Alert level="warning" title="Size Limits"><markdown>

The size of Minidumps can vary between a few kilobytes and many megabytes.
Contributing factors are the number of threads, size of stack space, and the
number of heap memory regions referenced from the stack. As Minidumps often
contain large regions of empty memory, the SDK compresses Minidumps before
uploading. Sentry drops requests with a body larger than _20MB_, or if they
contain files larger than _100MB_.

</markdown></Alert>

## Uploading Debug Information

To allow Sentry to fully process native crashes and provide you with
symbolicated stack traces, you need to upload _Debug Information Files_
(sometimes also referred to as _Debug Symbols_ or just _Symbols_). We recommend
uploading debug information during your build or release process.

For all libraries where you'd like to receive symbolication, **you need
to provide debug information**. This includes dependencies and operating system
libraries. If you are not sure which files are required, go to _Project
Settings > Processing Issues_, which shows a list of all the necessary files and
instructions to retrieve them.

In addition to Debug Information Files, Sentry needs _Call Frame Information_
(CFI) to extract accurate stack traces from minidumps of optimized release
builds. CFI is usually part of the executables and not copied to debug symbols.
Unless you are uploading Breakpad symbols, be sure to also include the binaries
when uploading files to Sentry.

For more information on uploading debug information and their supported formats,
see [Debug Information Files](/workflow/debug-files/).

## Releases

A release is a version of your code that you deploy to an environment. When you give Sentry information about your releases, you unlock many new features:

- Determine the issue and regressions introduced in a new release
- Predict which commit caused an issue and who is likely responsible
- Resolve issues by including the issue number in your commit message
- Receive email notifications when your code gets deployed

After configuring your SDK, setting up releases is a 2-step process:

1. [Create Release and Associate Commits](/workflow/releases/#create-release)
2. [Tell Sentry When You Deploy a Release](/workflow/releases/#create-deploy)

For more information, see [Releases Are Better With Commits](https://blog.sentry.io/2017/05/01/release-commits.html).

To configure the SDK to send release information, set the release during
initialization:

```c
  sentry_options_t *options = sentry_options_new();
  sentry_options_set_release(options, "my-unique-release-1.0.0");
```

### Release Health

Monitor the [health of releases](/workflow/releases/health/) by observing user adoption, usage of the application, percentage of [crashes](/workflow/releases/health/#crash), and [session data](/workflow/releases/health/#session). Release health will provide insight into the impact of crashes and bugs as it relates to user experience, and reveal trends with each new issue through the release details, graphs, and filters.

To benefit from the health data, you must use at least version 0.4.0 of the Native SDK.
Metrics collection for release health is, by default, enabled, unless you specifically disabled collecting in the initialization options for the SDK.

```c
sentry_options_t *options = sentry_options_new();
// Session tracking is enabled by default. To disable:
sentry_options_set_auto_session_tracking(options, 0);
sentry_init(options);
```

The SDK automatically starts a new session when it is initialized via `sentry_init`, and will end that session automatically when the SDK is shut down via `sentry_shutdown`, or explicitly by calling `sentry_end_session`.
The SDK currently tracks only one concurrent session and will end the running session when using `sentry_start_session`.

For more details, see the [full documentation on Release Health](/workflow/releases/health/).

### Identification of the User

By default, the SDK will try to use the `id`, `email`, or `username` properties of the object set via `sentry_set_user` as the session’s distinct identifier. While this ID contains personally identifiable information, and is transmitted to the sentry backend, the ID will not persist server-side.

### Known Limitations

When using the Crashpad backend on macOS, the duration and status of crashes sessions can not be reliably determined, and may be classified as [`abnormal`](/workflow/releases/health/#release-details) exits instead.

## Context

Sentry supports additional context with events. Often this context is shared
among any issue captured in its lifecycle, and includes the following
components:

**Structured Contexts**

: Structured contexts are typically set automatically.

[**User**](#capturing-the-user)

: Information about the current actor.

[**Tags**](#tagging-events)

: Key/value pairs which generate breakdown charts and search filters.

[**Level**](#setting-the-level)

: An event's severity.

[**Fingerprint**](#setting-the-fingerprint)

: A value used for grouping events into issues.

[**Unstructured Extra Data**](#extra-context)

: Arbitrary unstructured data which the Sentry SDK stores with an event sample.

<Alert level="warning" title="Context Size Limits"><markdown>

Sentry will try its best to accommodate the data you send it, but large context
payloads will be trimmed or may be truncated entirely. For more details see the
[data handling SDK documentation](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/data-handling/)

</markdown></Alert>

Context information is attached to every event until explicitly removed or
overwritten.

### Extra Context

In addition to the structured contexts that Sentry understands, you can send
arbitrary key/value pairs of data which the Sentry SDK will store alongside the
event. These are not indexed, and the Sentry SDK uses them to add additional
information about what might be happening.

`sentry_set_extra` takes the name of the extra value as first parameter, and the
value as `sentry_value_t` as second parameter:

```c
sentry_value_t screen = sentry_value_new_object();
sentry_value_set_by_key(screen, "width", sentry_value_new_int32(1920));
sentry_value_set_by_key(screen, "height", sentry_value_new_int32(1080));
sentry_set_extra("screen_size", screen);
```

### Capturing the User

Sending users to Sentry will unlock many features, primarily the ability to
drill down into the number of users affecting an issue, as well as to get a
broader sense about the quality of the application.

```c
sentry_value_t user = sentry_value_new_object();
sentry_value_set_by_key(user, "id", sentry_value_new_int32(42));
sentry_value_set_by_key(user, "username", sentry_value_new_string("John Doe"));
sentry_set_user(user);
```

Users consist of a few critical pieces of information which are used to
construct a unique identity in Sentry. Each of these is optional, but
one **must** be present for the Sentry SDK to capture the user:

`id`

: Your internal identifier for the user.

`username`

: The user's username. Generally used as a better label than the internal ID.

`email`

: An alternative, or addition, to a username. Sentry is aware of email addresses
and can show things like Gravatars, unlock messaging capabilities, and more.

`ip_address`

: The IP address of the user. If the user is unauthenticated, providing the IP
address will suggest that this is unique to that IP. If available, we will
attempt to pull this from the HTTP request data.

Additionally, you can provide arbitrary key/value pairs beyond the reserved
names, and the Sentry SDK will store those with the user.

### Tagging Events

Tags are key/value pairs assigned to events that can be used for breaking down
issues or quick access to finding related events.

```c
sentry_set_tag("server_name", "caroline");
```

For more information, see the [Tagging Events section](/enriching-error-data/additional-data/#tags) in Context.

### Setting the Level

You can set the severity of an event to one of five values (sorted from most
severe to least severe): `fatal`, `error`, `warning`, `info`, and `debug`. The
default level is `error`.

```c
sentry_set_level(SENTRY_LEVEL_WARNING);
```

### Setting the Fingerprint

Sentry uses a fingerprint to decide how to group errors into issues.

For some very advanced use cases, you can override the Sentry default grouping
using the `fingerprint` attribute. In supported SDKs, this attribute can be
passed with the event information and should be an array of strings.

If you wish to append information, thus making the grouping slightly less
aggressive, you can do that as well by adding the special
string `{{default}}` as one of the items.

For code samples, see [Grouping & Fingerprints](/data-management/event-grouping/?platform=python#use-cases).

For more information, see [Aggregate Errors with Custom
Fingerprints](https://blog.sentry.io/2018/01/18/setting-up-custom-fingerprints).

## Advanced Usage

### Advanced Configuration

The Native SDK sets the options when you first initialize the SDK:

```c
sentry_options_t *options = sentry_options_new();

sentry_options_set_environment(options, "Production");
sentry_options_set_release(options, "5fd7a6cd");
sentry_options_set_debug(options, 1);

sentry_init(options);
```

For more information, see:

- [Sentry’s complete list of Common Options across SDKs](/error-reporting/configuration/)
- [Full documentation on Environments](/enriching-error-data/environments/)

### Breadcrumbs

To receive more information on actions leading up to an exception or crash, the
SDK can record breadcrumbs that are automatically added to every event. The most
recent breadcrumbs are kept in a buffer.

You can manually add breadcrumbs using `sentry_add_breadcrumb`:

```c
#include <sentry.h>

sentry_value_t crumb = sentry_value_new_breadcrumb("default", "Authenticated user");
sentry_value_set_by_key(crumb, "category", sentry_value_new_string("auth"));
sentry_value_set_by_key(crumb, "level", sentry_value_new_string("info"));
sentry_add_breadcrumb(crumb);
```

For more information, see:

- [Full documentation on Breadcrumbs](/enriching-error-data/breadcrumbs/)
- [Debug Issues Faster with
  Breadcrumbs](https://blog.sentry.io/2016/05/04/breadcrumbs).

### Filter Events & Custom Logic

Sentry exposes a `before_send` callback which can be used to filter out
information or add additional context to the event object. The callback must
conform to the `sentry_event_function_t` signature.

```c
#include <sentry.h>

sentry_value_t strip_sensitive_data(sentry_value_t event, void *hint) {
  /* modify event here or return NULL to discard the event */
  return event;
}

int main(void) {
  sentry_options_t *options = sentry_options_new();
  sentry_options_set_before_send(options, strip_sensitive_data);
  sentry_init(options);

  /* ... */
}
```

The callback is executed in the same thread as the call to
`sentry_capture_event`. Work performed by the function may thus block the
executing thread. For this reason, consider avoiding heavy work in
`before_send`.

For more information, see:

- [Full documentation on Filtering Events](/error-reporting/configuration/filtering/)
- [Manage Your Flow of Errors Using Inbound
  Filters](https://blog.sentry.io/2017/11/27/setting-up-inbound-filters).

<Alert level="warning" title="Crashpad Notice"><markdown>

The Crashpad Backend sends Minidumps with an additional event payload
out-of-process. `before_send` hooks are not invoked when capturing crashes
using Crashpad.

</markdown></Alert>

### Transports

The Native SDK uses _Transports_ to send event payloads to Sentry. The default
transport depends on the target platform:

- **Windows**: WinHTTP
- **Linux**: Curl
- **macOS**: Curl

To specify a custom transport, use the `sentry_options_set_transport` function
and supply a transport that implements the `sentry_transport_t` interface.

```c
#include <sentry.h>

void custom_transport(sentry_envelope_t *envelope, void *state) {
  /*
   * Send the event here. If the transport requires state, such as an HTTP
   * client object or request queue, it can be specified in the `state`
   * parameter when configuring the transport. It will be passed as second
   * argument to this function.
   * The transport takes ownership of the `envelope`, and must free it once it
   * is done.
   */
  sentry_envelope_free(envelope);
}

int main(void) {
  void *transport_state = 0;

  sentry_options_t *options = sentry_options_new();
  sentry_transport_t *transport = sentry_transport_new(custom_transport);
  sentry_transport_set_state(transport, transport_state);

  sentry_options_set_transport(options, transport);
  sentry_init(options);

  /* ... */
}
```

The transport is invoked in the same thread as the call to
`sentry_capture_event`. Consider to offload network communication to a
background thread or thread pool to avoid blocking execution.

## Integrations

*Integrations* extend the functionality of the SDK for some common frameworks
and libraries. Similar to plugins, they extend the functionality of the Sentry
SDK.

The Native SDK can use different backends that are responsible for capturing
crashes. The backend is configured at build-time, using the `SENTRY_BACKEND`
CMake option, with support for the following options:

- `crashpad`, which is the default on Windows and macOS,
- `breakpad`, which is the default on Linux,
- `inproc`, the default on Android, and
- `none`, that disables capturing crashes altogether.

### Google Crashpad

[Crashpad](https://chromium.googlesource.com/crashpad/crashpad/+/master/README.md)
is an open-source multiplatform crash reporting system written in C++ by Google.
It supports macOS, Windows, and Linux, and features an uploader to
submit Minidumps to a configured URL right when the process crashes.

To use the Crashpad backend with the Native SDK, configure the CMake build
with the `SENTRY_BACKEND=crashpad` option. This will automatically create a
`crashpad_handler` executable alongside the `sentry` library.

```shell
$ cmake -B build -D SENTRY_BACKEND=crashpad
```

The SDK will automatically look for a `crashpad_handler` executable in the same
directory as the running application. It will also use the `.sentry-native`
directory as its database by default, relative to the current working directory
of your application.
This location temporarily hosts Minidumps before they are uploaded to Sentry.

Both of these paths can be customized like this:

```c
sentry_options_t *options = sentry_options_new();
sentry_options_set_handler_path(options, "path/to/crashpad_handler");
sentry_options_set_database_path(options, "sentry-db-directory");
sentry_init(options);
```

The crashpad handler executable must be shipped alongside your application so
that it can be launched when initializing the SDK. The path is evaluated
according to shell lookup rules at runtime.

It is advised to specify both the path to the `crashpad_handler` executable
as well as the path to the database directory manually.

## Event Attachments

Besides the Minidump file, Sentry can optionally store additional files uploaded
in the same request, such as log files. Learn more about these in [Attachments](/enriching-error-data/attachments/).

To add an attachment, the path to the file has to be configured when
initializing the SDK. It will monitor the file and upload it along with any event
or crash that is sent to Sentry:

```c
sentry_options_add_attachment(options, "/var/server.log");
```
