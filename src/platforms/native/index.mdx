The Sentry Native SDK is intended for C and C++. However, since it builds as a
dynamic library and exposes C-bindings, it can be used by any language that
supports interoperability with C, such as the Foreign Function Interface (FFI).

Sentry also offers higher-level SDKs for platforms with built-in support for
native crashes:

- [_Android_](/platforms/android/)
- [_Cocoa_](/clients/cocoa/)
- [_Electron_](/platforms/electron/)

We recommend using the Sentry Native SDK, which has built-in support for both Google Breakpad and Google Crashpad. However, if you would like to use Sentry with a third-party framework directly without using the Native SDK, see the following resources:

- [_Google Breakpad_](guides/breakpad/)
- [_Google Crashpad_](guides/crashpad/)
- [_Unreal Engine 4_](guides/ue4/)

## Install

The Native SDK currently supports **Windows**, **macOS**, **Linux**, and **Android**.

To build the SDK, download the latest release of the SDK from the [Releases
page](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-native/releases).
The SDK is managed as a [CMake] project, which additionally supports several configuration options, such as the backend to use.

For example, `CMake` can be used like this (on macOS):

```shell
# configure the cmake build into the `build` directory, with crashpad (on macOS)
$ cmake -B build -D SENTRY_BACKEND=crashpad
# build the project
$ cmake --build build --parallel
# install the resulting artifacts into a specific prefix
$ cmake --install build --prefix install
# which will result in the following (on macOS):
$ exa --tree install
install
├── bin
│  └── crashpad_handler
├── include
│  └── sentry.h
└── lib
   ├── libsentry.dylib
   └── libsentry.dylib.dSYM
```

[cmake]: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/

## Configure

After completing the project setup in Sentry, it shows the _Data Source Name_
(DSN). It looks similar to a standard URL, and contains all configuration for
the SDK.

Import and initialize the Sentry SDK early in your application setup:

```c
#include <sentry.h>

int main(void) {
  sentry_options_t *options = sentry_options_new();
  sentry_options_set_dsn(options, "___PUBLIC_DSN___");
  sentry_init(options);

  /* ... */

  // make sure everything flushes
  sentry_shutdown();
}
```

<Alert level="warning" title="Warning"><markdown>

Calling `sentry_shutdown()` before exiting the application is critical. It
ensures that events can be sent to Sentry before execution stops. Otherwise,
event data may be lost.

</markdown></Alert>

Alternatively, the DSN can be passed as `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable during
runtime. This can be especially useful for server applications.

### Verify

Now that SDK setup is complete, verify that all configuration is correct. Start
by capturing a manual event:

```c
sentry_capture_event(sentry_value_new_message_event(
  /*   level */ SENTRY_LEVEL_INFO,
  /*  logger */ "custom",
  /* message */ "It works!"
));
```

Once the event is captured, it will show up on the Sentry dashboard.
