*Backends*Â extend the functionality of the SDK for some common frameworks
and libraries. Similar to plugins, they extend the functionality of the Sentry
SDK.

The Native SDK can use different backends that are responsible for capturing
crashes. The backend is configured at build-time, using the `SENTRY_BACKEND`
CMake option, with support for the following options:

- [`crashpad`](crashpad/), which is the default on Windows and macOS,
- `breakpad`, which is the default on Linux,
- `inproc`, the default on Android, and
- `none`, that disables capturing crashes altogether.
