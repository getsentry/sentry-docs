The Native SDK uses _Transports_ to send event payloads to Sentry. The default
transport depends on the target platform:

- **Windows**: WinHTTP
- **Linux**: Curl
- **macOS**: Curl

To specify a custom transport, use the `sentry_options_set_transport` function
and supply a transport that implements the `sentry_transport_t` interface.

```c
#include <sentry.h>

void custom_transport(sentry_envelope_t *envelope, void *state) {
  /*
   * Send the event here. If the transport requires state, such as an HTTP
   * client object or request queue, it can be specified in the `state`
   * parameter when configuring the transport. It will be passed as second
   * argument to this function.
   * The transport takes ownership of the `envelope`, and must free it once it
   * is done.
   */
  sentry_envelope_free(envelope);
}

int main(void) {
  void *transport_state = 0;

  sentry_options_t *options = sentry_options_new();
  sentry_transport_t *transport = sentry_transport_new(custom_transport);
  sentry_transport_set_state(transport, transport_state);

  sentry_options_set_transport(options, transport);
  sentry_init(options);

  /* ... */
}
```

The transport is invoked in the same thread as the call to
`sentry_capture_event`. Consider to offload network communication to a
background thread or thread pool to avoid blocking execution.
