title: Advanced Configuration
---

The Native SDK sets the options when you first initialize the SDK:

```c
sentry_options_t *options = sentry_options_new();

sentry_options_set_environment(options, "Production");
sentry_options_set_release(options, "5fd7a6cd");
sentry_options_set_debug(options, 1);

sentry_init(options);
```

- [Sentryâ€™s complete list of Common Options across SDKs](../configuration/)
- [Full documentation on Environments](../configuration/environments/)

## Capturing Events

The Native SDK exposes a _Value API_ to construct values like Exceptions, User
objects, Tags, and even entire Events. There are several ways to create an
event.

### Manual Events

To create and capture a manual event, follow these steps:

1. Create an event value using `sentry_value_new_event`. This internally
   creates an object value and initializes it with common event attributes, like
   a `timestamp` and `event_id`.
2. Add custom attributes to the event, like a `message` or an `exception`.
3. Send the event to Sentry by invoking `sentry_capture_event`.

In a more complex example, it looks like this:

```c
sentry_value_t event = sentry_value_new_event();
sentry_value_set_by_key(event, "message", sentry_value_new_string("Hello!"));

sentry_value_t screen = sentry_value_new_object();
sentry_value_set_by_key(screen, "width", sentry_value_new_int32(1920));
sentry_value_set_by_key(screen, "height", sentry_value_new_int32(1080));

sentry_value_t extra = sentry_value_new_object();
sentry_value_set_by_key(extra, "screen_size", screen);

sentry_value_set_by_key(event, "extra", extra);
sentry_capture_event(event);
```

For the full list of supported values, see [_Event Payloads_](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/event-payloads/) and linked
documents.

### Exceptions

To capture an error or exception condition, create events containing an
exception object. It needs to contain at least a value and type:

```c
#include <sentry.h>

sentry_value_t exc = sentry_value_new_object();
sentry_value_set_by_key(exc, "type", sentry_value_new_string("Exception"));
sentry_value_set_by_key(exc, "value", sentry_value_new_string("Error message."));

sentry_value_t event = sentry_value_new_event();
sentry_value_set_by_key(event, "exception", exc);
sentry_capture_event(event);
```

This exception does not contain a stack trace, which must be added separately.

### Message Events

To simplify creating events, there are shorthand functions that construct
prepopulated event objects. The most important one is
`sentry_value_new_message_event`. The `logger` and `message` parameters are each
optional.

```c
sentry_value_t event = sentry_value_new_message_event(
  /*   level */ SENTRY_LEVEL_INFO,
  /*  logger */ "custom",
  /* message */ "It works!"
);
```

### Application Crashes

By default, the Native SDK intercepts crash signals and unhandled exceptions to
send crash reports to Sentry. Depending on the [backend](../backends/), the
crash report can be sent as a conventional event or as a native crash report
file. On Windows, Linux, and macOS, the default backends send binary Minidump
files. Sentry processes them to extract stack traces and exception information
into a readable crash report.

For more information on Minidumps and the limits that apply, see
[What is a Minidump](/platforms/native/guides/minidumps/#what-is-a-minidump).

<Alert level="warning" title="Size Limits"><markdown>

The size of Minidumps can vary between a few kilobytes and many megabytes.
Contributing factors are the number of threads, size of stack space, and the
number of heap memory regions referenced from the stack. As Minidumps often
contain large regions of empty memory, the SDK compresses Minidumps before
uploading. Sentry drops requests with a body larger than _20MB_, or if they
contain files larger than _100MB_.
