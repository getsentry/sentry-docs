title: Releases

A release is a version of your code that you deploy to an environment. When you give Sentry information about your releases, you unlock many new features:

- Determine the issue and regressions introduced in a new release
- Predict which commit caused an issue and who is likely responsible
- Resolve issues by including the issue number in your commit message
- Receive email notifications when your code gets deployed

For more information, seeÂ [Releases Are Better With Commits](https://blog.sentry.io/2017/05/01/release-commits.html).

## Configure

To configure Unreal to send release information, set the release [during
initialization](../advanced-config/):

```cpp
TSharedPtr<FJsonObject> config = MakeShareable(new FJsonObject);
config->SetStringField("release", "name-of-app@1.0.0");
```
