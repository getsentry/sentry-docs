With [profiling](/product/profiling/), Sentry allows you to collect and analyze performance profiles from real user devices in production to give you a complete picture of how your application performs in a variety of environments.

## Enable Performance Monitoring

Profiling depends on Sentryâ€™s performance monitoring product being enabled beforehand. To enable performance monitoring in the SDK:

In `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<application>
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.dsn" android:value="___PUBLIC_DSN___" />
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.traces.sample-rate" android:value="1.0" />
</application>
```

Check out the <PlatformLink to="/performance/">performance setup documentation</PlatformLink> for more detailed information on how to configure sampling. Setting the sample rate to 1.0 means all transactions will be captured.

By default, some transactions will be created automatically for common operations like loading a view controller/activity and app startup.

## Enable Profiling

<Note>

Android profiling is available starting in SDK version `6.16.0`.

</Note>

In `AndroidManifest.xml`:

<SignInNote />

```xml
<application>
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.dsn" android:value="___PUBLIC_DSN___" />
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.traces.sample-rate" android:value="1.0" />
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.traces.profiling.sample-rate" android:value="1.0" />
</application>
```

<Note>

The `io.sentry.traces.profiling.sample-rate` setting is _relative_ to the `io.sentry.traces.sample-rate` setting.
