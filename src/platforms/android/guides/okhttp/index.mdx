On this page, we get you up and running with Sentry's OkHttp Integration, so that it will automatically add a breadcrumb and start a span out of the active span bound to the scope for each HTTP Request.

<Note>

If you don't already have an account and Sentry project established, head over to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/signup/), then return to this page.

</Note>

## Install

Sentry captures data by adding an OkHttp `Interceptor`.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-install" />

## Configure

Configuration should happen once you create your `OkHttpClient` instance.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-config" />

## Verify

This snippet includes a HTTP Request and captures an intentional message, so you can test that everything is working as soon as you set it up:

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-verify" />

<Note>

Learn more about manually capturing an error or message, in our <PlatformLink to="/usage/">Usage documentation</PlatformLink>.

</Note>

To view and resolve the recorded message, log into [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and open your project. Clicking on the error's title will open a page where you can see detailed information and mark it as resolved.
