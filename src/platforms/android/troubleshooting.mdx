## NDK

If you're using a version of `sentry-android` before 5.0, due to current limitations in how `sentry-native` works, it cannot identify native libraries loaded directly from `.apk` files. Instead, it needs to have access to the extracted libraries on the file system.
This functionality is [disabled by default](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/gradle-plugin#extractNativeLibs)
when using an Android Gradle Plugin >= v3.6.0, and it needs to be enabled with the
[`extractNativeLibs`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/application-element#extractNativeLibs) configuration option.

If you're using [Android App Bundle](https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle), set `android.bundle.enableUncompressedNativeLibs=false` along with the `extractNativeLibs` configuration option.

In addition, `sentry-native` uses [tagged pointers](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/debug/tagged-pointers)
internally. As a result, the Android SDK won't work out of the box on devices with a newer Android OS because they have their own conflicting pointer tagging.

<Note>

If you're using a version of `sentry-android` before 3.1, you must manually disable the [`allowNativeHeapPointerTagging`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/application-element#allowNativeHeapPointerTagging) configuration option because `sentry-native` uses [tagged pointers](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/debug/tagged-pointers)
internally. As a result, this option won't work out of the box on devices with a newer Android OS because they have their own conflicting pointer tagging. This is fixed in `sentry-android` versions 3.1 and above.

</Note>

**Example AndroidManifest.xml**:

```xml {filename:AndroidManifest.xml}
<application
    android:allowNativeHeapPointerTagging="false"
    android:extractNativeLibs="true">
</application>
```

**Example gradle.properties**:

```properties {filename:gradle.properties}
android.bundle.enableUncompressedNativeLibs=false
```

## Sentry Android Gradle Plugin Build Issues

The [Sentry Android Gradle plugin](/platforms/android/gradle/) uses bytecode manipulation to automatically measure the performance of your application. This process requires looking at the dependencies of the application, which can potentially break the build process if there are libraries which have been compiled/minified with a non-default java compiler, like R8/D8.

The culprit is usually our [File I/O instrumentation](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/file-io/), which can be disabled as follows:

```groovy
import io.sentry.android.gradle.InstrumentationFeature

sentry {
  tracingInstrumentation {
    enabled = true
    features = EnumSet.allOf(InstrumentationFeature) - InstrumentationFeature.FILE_IO
  }
}
```

```kotlin
import java.util.EnumSet
import io.sentry.android.gradle.InstrumentationFeature

sentry {
  tracingInstrumentation {
    enabled.set(true)
    features.set(EnumSet.allOf(InstrumentationFeature::class.java) - InstrumentationFeature.FILE_IO)
  }
}
```

If disabling the file I/O instrumentation feature doesn't help, you can also disable the entire bytecode manipulation logic through the `tracingInstrumentation.enabled` flag:

```groovy
sentry {
  tracingInstrumentation {
    enabled = false
  }
}
```

```kotlin
sentry {
  tracingInstrumentation {
    enabled.set(false)
  }
}
```

Please consider reporting these issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-android-gradle-plugin/issues), so we can keep track of them.
