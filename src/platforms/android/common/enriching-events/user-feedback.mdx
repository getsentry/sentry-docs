The user feedback API provides the ability to collect user information when an event occurs. Sentry pairs the feedback with the original event, giving you additional insight into issues.
Sentry needs the `eventId` to be able to associate the user feedback to the corresponding event. To get the `eventId`, for example, you can use the <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#before-send">beforeSend</PlatformLink> or the return value of the methods capturing an event.

```java
import io.sentry.Sentry;
import io.sentry.UserFeedback;

SentryId sentryId = Sentry.captureMessage("My message");

UserFeedback userFeedback = new UserFeedback(sentryId);
userFeedback.setComments("It broke.");
userFeedback.setEmail("john.doe@example.com");
userFeedback.setName("John Doe");
Sentry.captureUserFeedback(userFeedback);
```

```kotlin
import io.sentry.Sentry
import io.sentry.UserFeedback

val sentryId = Sentry.captureMessage("My message")

val userFeedback = UserFeedback(sentryId).apply {
  comments = "It broke."
  email = "john.doe@example.com"
  name = "John Doe"
}
Sentry.captureUserFeedback(userFeedback)
```
