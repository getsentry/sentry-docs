The [Sentry Android Gradle Plugin](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-android-gradle-plugin) is an addition to the main Android and Hybrid SDKs (like React Native and Flutter) and offers
seamless integration with the Gradle build system. It supports the upload of ProGuard/R8 mappings and of Native debug symbols and sources, as well as
auto-instrumentation tracing through bytecode manipulation.

## Setup

### Install

Using Gradle (Android Studio) in your `app/build.gradle` add:

```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
}

plugins {
    id "io.sentry.android.gradle" version "{{ packages.version('sentry.java.android.gradle-plugin', '3.0.0') }}"
}
```

```kotlin
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
}

plugins {
    id("io.sentry.android.gradle") version "{{ packages.version('sentry.java.android.gradle-plugin', '3.0.0') }}"
}
```
<Note>

The `io.sentry.android.gradle` >= `3.0.0` requires [Android Gradle Plugin >= 7.0.0](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/gradle-plugin#7-0-0).

</Note>

### Configure

We expose the following configuration values directly in your `app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
import io.sentry.android.gradle.InstrumentationFeature

sentry {
    // Disables or enables the handling of Proguard mapping for Sentry.
    // If enabled the plugin will generate a UUID and will take care of
    // uploading the mapping to Sentry. If disabled, all the logic
    // related to proguard mapping will be excluded.
    // Default is enabled.
    includeProguardMapping = true

    // Whether the plugin should attempt to auto-upload the mapping file to Sentry or not.
    // If disabled the plugin will run a dry-run and just generate a UUID.
    // The mapping file has to be uploaded manually via sentry-cli in this case.
    // Default is enabled.
    autoUploadProguardMapping = true

    // Disables or enables the automatic configuration of Native Symbols
    // for Sentry. This executes sentry-cli automatically so
    // you don't need to do it manually.
    // Default is disabled.
    uploadNativeSymbols = false

    // Does or doesn't include the source code of native code for Sentry.
    // This executes sentry-cli with the --include-sources param. automatically so
    // you don't need to do it manually.
    // Default is disabled.
    includeNativeSources = false

    // Enable or disable the tracing instrumentation.
    // Does auto instrumentation for specified features through bytecode manipulation.
    // Default is enabled.
    tracingInstrumentation {
      enabled = true

      // Specifies a set of instrumentation features that are eligible for bytecode manipulation.
      // Defaults to all available values of InstrumentationFeature enum class.
      features = [InstrumentationFeature.DATABASE, InstrumentationFeature.FILE_IO]
    }
}
```

```kotlin
import io.sentry.android.gradle.InstrumentationFeature

sentry {
    // Disables or enables the handling of Proguard mapping for Sentry.
    // If enabled the plugin will generate a UUID and will take care of
    // uploading the mapping to Sentry. If disabled, all the logic
    // related to proguard mapping will be excluded.
    // Default is enabled.
    includeProguardMapping.set(true)
    
    // Whether the plugin should attempt to auto-upload the mapping file to Sentry or not.
    // If disabled the plugin will run a dry-run and just generate a UUID.
    // The mapping file has to be uploaded manually via sentry-cli in this case.
    // Default is enabled.
    autoUploadProguardMapping.set(true)

    // Disables or enables the automatic configuration of Native Symbols
    // for Sentry. This executes sentry-cli automatically so
    // you don't need to do it manually.
    // Default is disabled.
    uploadNativeSymbols.set(false)

    // Does or doesn't include the source code of native code for Sentry.
    // This executes sentry-cli with the --include-sources param. automatically so
    // you don't need to do it manually.
    // Default is disabled.
    includeNativeSources.set(false)

    // Enable or disable the tracing instrumentation.
    // Does auto instrumentation for specified features through bytecode manipulation.
    // Default is enabled.
    tracingInstrumentation {
      enabled.set(true)
      
      // Specifies a set of instrumentation features that are eligible for bytecode manipulation.
      // Defaults to all available values of InstrumentationFeature enum class.
      features.set(setOf(InstrumentationFeature.DATABASE, InstrumentationFeature.FILE_IO))
    }
}
```

Now when you build your app, the plugin will upload the ProGuard/R8 mappings, source bundle, and native symbols as you configured them to Sentry.

### Variant Filtering

You can specify which variant/flavor/build-type should be ignored by Sentry in your `app/build.gradle` file:

```groovy
sentry {
    // List the build types that should be ignored (e.g. "release").
    ignoredBuildTypes = ["release"]

    // List the build flavors that should be ignored (e.g. "production").
    ignoredFlavors = ["production"]

    // List the build variant that should be ignored (e.g. "productionRelease").
    ignoredVariants = ["productionRelease"]
}
```

```kotlin
sentry {
    // List the build types that should be ignored (e.g. "release").
    ignoredBuildTypes.set(setOf("release"))

    // List the build flavors that should be ignored (e.g. "production").
    ignoredFlavors.set(setOf("production"))

    // List the build variant that should be ignored (e.g. "productionRelease").
    ignoredVariants.set(setOf("productionRelease"))
}
```

## ProGuard/R8

The plugin will automatically generate appropriate ProGuard mapping files and upload them when you run `gradle assemble{BuildVariant}`. For example, `assembleRelease` — Release is the default, but the plugin works for others if you have enabled ProGuard/R8. The credentials for the upload step are loaded through environment variables or from a `sentry.properties` file in your project root.

Learn more in the [full sentry-cli documentation](/product/cli/configuration/#configuration-values).

At the very minimum, you will need something similar to:

```bash
defaults.project=your-project
defaults.org=your-org
auth.token=YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
```
<Note>

You can find your authentication token [on the Sentry API page](https://sentry.io/api/). For more information about the available configuration options, check out the [full sentry-cli documentation](/product/cli/configuration/#configuration-values).

</Note>

## Native Debug Symbols and Sources

The plugin will automatically discover and upload Native debug symbols and sources when you run `gradle assemble{BuildVariant}`. The `{BuildVariant}` must be a non-debuggable build type, for example `Release`. The credentials for the upload step are loaded via environment variables or from a `sentry.properties` file in your project root.

Learn more in the [full sentry-cli documentation](/product/cli/configuration/#configuration-values).

At the very minimum, you will need something similar to:

```bash
defaults.project=your-project
defaults.org=your-org
auth.token=YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
```
<Note>

You can find your authentication token [on the Sentry API page](https://sentry.io/api/). For more information about the available configuration options, check out the [full sentry-cli documentation](/product/cli/configuration/#configuration-values).

</Note>

## Tracing Auto-instrumentation

The plugin uses the [bytecode manipulation](https://www.infoq.com/articles/Living-Matrix-Bytecode-Manipulation/) framework to inject a code snippet 
that starts and finishes a [span](/product/sentry-basics/tracing/event-detail/#span-view) for common operations that can cause performance bottlenecks.
This way potentially heavy operations are automatically measured without the need to manually instrument them.

<Note>

For this data to be captured, you must enable [performance monitoring](/platforms/android/performance/).

</Note>

The plugin supports the following features for auto-instrumentation:

```kotlin
enum class InstrumentationFeature {
    /**
     * When enabled the SDK will create spans for any CRUD operation performed by 'androidx.sqlite'
     * and 'androidx.room'. This feature uses bytecode manipulation.
     *
     * Requires sentry-android SDK version 4.0.0 and above
     */
    DATABASE,

    /**
     * When enabled the SDK will create spans for [java.io.FileInputStream],
     * [java.io.FileOutputStream], [java.io.FileReader], [java.io.FileWriter].
     * This feature uses bytecode manipulation and replaces the above
     * mentioned classes with Sentry-specific implementations.
     *
     * Requires sentry-android SDK version 5.5.0 and above
     */
    FILE_IO
}
```

Check [Integrations](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/) page for more detailed explanation of each instrumentation feature.
