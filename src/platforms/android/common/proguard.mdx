If you want to see de-obfuscated stack traces, you'll need to use ProGuard with Sentry. To do so, upload the ProGuard mapping files by either the recommended method of using our [Gradle integration](/platforms/android/gradle/) or manually by using [sentry-cli](/product/cli/dif/#proguard-mapping-upload).

<Note>

The Android SDK ships with ProGuard rules automatically defined; no further configuration is needed.
