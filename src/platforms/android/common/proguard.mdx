To use ProGuard with Sentry, upload the ProGuard mapping files by using our Gradle integration (**recommended**) or manually by using [sentry-cli](/product/cli/dif/#proguard-mapping-upload).

## Gradle

Using Gradle (Android Studio) in your `app/build.gradle` add:

```groovy {filename:app/build.gradle}
apply plugin: 'io.sentry.android.gradle'
```

And declare a dependency in your top-level `build.gradle`:

```groovy {filename:build.gradle}
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }

    dependencies {
        // https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-android-gradle-plugin/releases
        classpath 'io.sentry:sentry-android-gradle-plugin:{{ packages.version('sentry.java.android.gradle-plugin', '1.7.36') }}'
    }
}
```

The plugin will automatically generate appropriate ProGuard mapping files and upload them when you run `gradle assemble{BuildVariant}`. For example, `assembleRelease` — Release is the default, but the plugin works for others if you have enabled ProGuard/R8. The credentials for the upload step are loaded via environment variables or from a `sentry.properties` file in your project root.

For more information, see the [full sentry-cli documentation](/product/cli/configuration/#configuration-values).

At the very minimum you will need something like this:

```bash
defaults.project=your-project
defaults.org=your-org
auth.token=YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
```

You can find your authentication token [on the Sentry API page](https://sentry.io/api/). For more information about the available configuration options, see the [full sentry-cli documentation](/product/cli/configuration/#configuration-values).

### Gradle Configuration

Additionally, we expose a few configuration values directly in Gradle:

```groovy {filename:app/build.gradle}
sentry {
    // Disables or enables the automatic configuration of ProGuard
    // for Sentry.  This injects a default config for ProGuard so
    // you don't need to do it manually.

    // Only enable it if you are using sentry-android <= v1.7,
    // sentry-android >= v2.0 already does it automatically.
    autoProguardConfig false

    // Enables or disables the automatic upload of mapping files
    // during a build.  If you disable this, you'll need to manually
    // upload the mapping files with sentry-cli when you do a release.
    autoUpload true

    // Disables or enables the automatic configuration of Native Symbols
    // for Sentry. This executes sentry-cli automatically so
    // you don't need to do it manually.
    // Default is disabled.
    uploadNativeSymbols false

    // Does or doesn't include the source code of native code for Sentry.
    // This executes sentry-cli with the --include-sources param. automatically so
    // you don't need to do it manually.
    // Default is disabled.
    includeNativeSources false
}
```

And that's it! Now when you build your app, the plugin will upload the ProGuard/R8 mappings,
source bundle, and native symbols, as you configured them to Sentry.
