To use ProGuard with Sentry, upload the ProGuard mapping files by either the recommended method of using our Gradle integration or manually by using [sentry-cli](/product/cli/dif/#proguard-mapping-upload).

<Note>

The Android SDK ships with ProGuard rules automatically defined; no further configuration is needed.

</Note>

## Gradle

Using Gradle (Android Studio) in your `app/build.gradle` add:

```groovy
plugins {
    id "io.sentry.android.gradle" version "{{ packages.version('sentry.java.android.gradle-plugin', '2.0.0') }}"
}

buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("io.sentry.android.gradle") version "{{ packages.version('sentry.java.android.gradle-plugin', '2.0.0') }}"
}

buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```

The plugin will automatically generate appropriate ProGuard mapping files and upload them when you run `gradle assemble{BuildVariant}`. For example, `assembleRelease` â€” Release is the default, but the plugin works for others if you have enabled ProGuard/R8. The credentials for the upload step are loaded via environment variables or from a `sentry.properties` file in your project root.

For more information, see the [full sentry-cli documentation](/product/cli/configuration/#configuration-values).

At the very minimum you will need something similar to:

```bash
defaults.project=your-project
defaults.org=your-org
auth.token=YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
```
<Note>

You can find your authentication token [on the Sentry API page](https://sentry.io/api/). For more information about the available configuration options, see the [full sentry-cli documentation](/product/cli/configuration/#configuration-values).

</Note>

### Gradle Configuration

Additionally, we expose a few configuration values directly in your `app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
sentry {
    // Enables or disables the automatic upload of mapping files
    // during a build.  If you disable this, you'll need to manually
    // upload the mapping files with sentry-cli when you do a release.
    autoUpload = true

    // Disables or enables the automatic configuration of Native Symbols
    // for Sentry. This executes sentry-cli automatically so
    // you don't need to do it manually.
    // Default is disabled.
    uploadNativeSymbols = false

    // Does or doesn't include the source code of native code for Sentry.
    // This executes sentry-cli with the --include-sources param. automatically so
    // you don't need to do it manually.
    // Default is disabled.
    includeNativeSources = false
}
```

```kotlin
sentry {
    // Enables or disables the automatic upload of mapping files
    // during a build.  If you disable this, you'll need to manually
    // upload the mapping files with sentry-cli when you do a release.
    autoUpload.set(true)

    // Disables or enables the automatic configuration of Native Symbols
    // for Sentry. This executes sentry-cli automatically so
    // you don't need to do it manually.
    // Default is disabled.
    uploadNativeSymbols.set(false)

    // Does or doesn't include the source code of native code for Sentry.
    // This executes sentry-cli with the --include-sources param. automatically so
    // you don't need to do it manually.
    // Default is disabled.
    includeNativeSources.set(false)
}
```

Now when you build your app, the plugin will upload the ProGuard/R8 mappings, source bundle, and native symbols as you configured them to Sentry.

### Multi-Dex Support

If you're using Multi-Dex and our SDK, we recommend updating your Multi-Dex configuration in your `app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    buildTypes {
        release {
            multiDexKeepProguard file('multidex-config.pro')
        }
    }
}
```

```kotlin
android {
    buildTypes {
        getByName("release") {
            multiDexKeepProguard = file('multidex-config.pro')
        }
    }
}
```

And, add to `multidex-config.pro` the following lines:

```
-keep class io.sentry.android.core.SentryAndroidOptions
-keep class io.sentry.android.ndk.SentryNdk
```

If you experience issues like `Could not find class` on devices running the `Dalvik VM`, you may expand the above rules to keep the necessary classes in the main dex file.
