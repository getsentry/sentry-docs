<Note>

Capturing transactions requires that you first <PlatformLink to="/performance/">set up performance monitoring</PlatformLink> if you haven't already.

Supported in Sentry's Android SDK version `4.3.0` and above.

### Android's Activity Instrumentation

The Activity's instrumentation, once enabled, captures transactions for each launch of an Activity. The SDK sets the Transaction name to the name of the Activity, for example, `MainActivity`, and Transaction operation to `navigation`.

The transaction starts before each Activity's `onCreate` method is called.

_The Activity's instrumentation is enabled by default, but you may disable it by setting:_

```xml {filename:AndroidManifest.xml}
<manifest>
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.traces.activity.enable" android:value="false" />
</manifest>
```

The transaction finishes after each Activity's `onResume` method is executed.

_The transaction finishes automatically, but you may disable it by setting:_

```xml {filename:AndroidManifest.xml}
<manifest>
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.traces.activity.auto-finish.enable" android:value="false" />
</manifest>
```

We offer the possibility to finish the transaction manually. For example, you might want to finish the transaction after an API call triggered on Activity's `onCreate` and shown the data to the user. To achieve that you can do:

```java
import io.sentry.Sentry;

ISpan span = Sentry.getSpan();
if (span != null) {
  span.finish();
}
```

```kotlin
import io.sentry.Sentry

val span = Sentry.getSpan()
span?.finish()
```

In case that the user left this Activity before you've finished the transaction manually, the SDK finishes the transaction automatically when the `onDestroy` method is called.

Transactions are always bound to the Scope automatically if there's none set. Because of that, you may create spans using manual instrumentation, and those spans will be automatically associated with the Activity's running transaction.

```java
import java.lang.Exception;

import io.sentry.ISpan;
import io.sentry.Sentry;
import io.sentry.SpanStatus;

void displayUserData() {
  ISpan span = Sentry.getSpan();
  if (span != null) {
    ISpan innerSpan = span.startChild("displayUserData");
    try {
      // omitted code
    } catch (Exception e) {
      innerSpan.setThrowable(e);
      innerSpan.setStatus(SpanStatus.NOT_FOUND);
      throw e;
    } finally {
      innerSpan.finish();
    }
  }
}
```

```kotlin
import java.lang.Exception

import io.sentry.Sentry
import io.sentry.SpanStatus

fun displayUserData() {
  val span = Sentry.getSpan()
  span?.let {
    val innerSpan = it.startChild("displayUserData")

    try {
      // omitted code
    } catch (e: Exception) {
      innerSpan.throwable = e
      innerSpan.status = SpanStatus.NOT_FOUND
      throw e
    } finally {
      innerSpan.finish()
    }
  }
}
```

When you didn't finish the transaction yet, but you start a new Activity, the SDK always automatically finishes the previous Activity transaction. This is due to the fact that only one transaction at a time can be bound to the Scope. To work around that, you may create transactions manually using the custom instrumentation and its instance to start spans instead of the Static API.

### Android's Fragment Instrumentation

Once enabled, Android's Fragment Instrumentation starts a span for each launch of a fragment. The SDK sets the span operation to `ui.fragment.load` and the span description to the fragment's name, for example, `LoginFragment`.

The span starts after each fragment's `onCreate` method is called and before its `onCreateView` method is called.

The span finishes after each fragment's `onResume` method is executed.

Android's Fragment Instrumentation depends on having an active transaction bound to the scope, and ideally it'd be used along with [Android's Activity Instrumentation](/platforms/android/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#androids-activity-instrumentation), which starts a transaction and binds it to the scope automatically.

Learn more in our [Fragment documentation](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/fragment/).

### App Start Instrumentation

<Note>

This is a preview API, available in `5.1.0-beta.1` and above. Features available in a preview API are still in progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony. The API may be renamed, changed, or removed in a future version.

</Note>

The App Start Instrumentation provides insight into how long your application takes to launch. It adds a span from the application launch to the first auto-generated UI transaction.

The SDK differentiates between a cold and a warm start, but doesn't track hot starts/resumes.
* __Cold start__: A cold start refers to an app’s starting from scratch: the system’s process has not, until this start, created the app’s process. Cold starts happen in cases such as your app’s being launched for the first time since the device booted, or since the system killed the app.
* __Warm start__: A warm start encompasses some subset of the operations that take place during a cold start; at the same time, it represents more overhead than a hot start. For instance: The user backs out of your app, but then re-launches it. The process may have continued to run, but the app must recreate the activity from scratch via a call to `onCreate()`.


The SDK uses the `SentryPerformanceProvider` (ContentProvider) creation time as the beginning of the app start and the first `Activity#onResume` call as the end.

You can opt out of Android's Activity Instrumentation and App Start Instrumentation using options:

```xml {filename:AndroidManifest.xml}
<manifest>
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.traces.activity.enable" android:value="false" />
</manifest>
```

### OkHttp library Instrumentation

The OkHttp's instrumentation, once added the `SentryOkHttpInterceptor`, starts a span out of the active span bound to the scope for each HTTP Request. The SDK sets the span `operation` to `http.client` and `description` to request `$method and $URL`; for example, `GET https://sentry.io`.

The span finishes once the request has been executed. The span `status` depends on either the HTTP Response `code` or `SpanStatus.INTERNAL_ERROR` if the `code` does not match any of Sentry's `SpanStatus`.

When the HTTP request throws an `IOException`, Sentry's SDK associates this exception to the running span. If you haven't set the SDK to swallow the exception and capture it, the span and SentryEvent will be linked when viewing it on the **Issue Details** page in sentry.io.
