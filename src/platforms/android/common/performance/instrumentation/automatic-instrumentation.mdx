Capturing transactions requires that you first <PlatformLink to="/performance/">set up performance monitoring</PlatformLink> if you haven't already.

Supported in Sentry's Android SDK version `4.3.0` and above.

</Note>

### Android's Activity Instrumentation

The Activity's instrumentation, once enabled, captures transactions for each launch of an Activity. The SDK sets the Transaction name to the name of the Activity, for example, `MainActivity`, and Transaction operation to `ui.load`.

The transaction starts before each Activity's `onCreate` method is called.

_The Activity's instrumentation is enabled by default, but you may disable it by setting:_

```xml {filename:AndroidManifest.xml}
<application>
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.traces.activity.enable" android:value="false" />
</application>
```

The transaction finishes after each Activity's `onResume` method is executed.

_The transaction finishes automatically, but you may disable it by setting:_

```xml {filename:AndroidManifest.xml}
<application>
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.traces.activity.auto-finish.enable" android:value="false" />
</application>
```

We offer the possibility to finish the transaction manually. For example, you might want to finish the transaction after an API call triggered on Activity's `onCreate` and shown the data to the user. To achieve that you can do:

```java
import io.sentry.Sentry;

ISpan span = Sentry.getSpan();
if (span != null) {
  span.finish();
}
```

```kotlin
import io.sentry.Sentry

val span = Sentry.getSpan()
span?.finish()
```

In case that the user left this Activity before you've finished the transaction manually, the SDK finishes the transaction automatically when the `onDestroy` method is called.

Transactions are always bound to the Scope automatically if there's none set. Because of that, you may create spans using custom instrumentation, and those spans will be automatically associated with the Activity's running transaction.

```java
import java.lang.Exception;

import io.sentry.ISpan;
import io.sentry.Sentry;
import io.sentry.SpanStatus;

void displayUserData() {
  ISpan span = Sentry.getSpan();
  if (span != null) {
    ISpan innerSpan = span.startChild("displayUserData");
    try {
      // omitted code
    } catch (Exception e) {
      innerSpan.setThrowable(e);
      innerSpan.setStatus(SpanStatus.NOT_FOUND);
      throw e;
    } finally {
      innerSpan.finish();
    }
  }
}
```

```kotlin
import java.lang.Exception

import io.sentry.Sentry
import io.sentry.SpanStatus

fun displayUserData() {
  val span = Sentry.getSpan()
  span?.let {
    val innerSpan = it.startChild("displayUserData")

    try {
      // omitted code
    } catch (e: Exception) {
      innerSpan.throwable = e
      innerSpan.status = SpanStatus.NOT_FOUND
      throw e
    } finally {
      innerSpan.finish()
    }
  }
}
```

When you didn't finish the transaction yet, but you start a new Activity, the SDK always automatically finishes the previous Activity transaction. This is due to the fact that only one transaction at a time can be bound to the Scope. To work around that, you may create transactions manually using the custom instrumentation and its instance to start spans instead of the Static API.

### Android's Fragment Instrumentation

Once enabled, Android's Fragment Instrumentation starts a span for each launch of a fragment. The SDK sets the span operation to `ui.load` and the span description to the fragment's name, for example, `LoginFragment`.

The span starts after each fragment's `onCreate` method is called and before its `onCreateView` method is called.

The span finishes after each fragment's `onResume` method is executed.

Android's Fragment Instrumentation depends on having an active transaction bound to the scope, and ideally it'd be used along with [Android's Activity Instrumentation](/platforms/android/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#androids-activity-instrumentation), which starts a transaction and binds it to the scope automatically.

Learn more in our [Fragment documentation](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/fragment/).

### App Start Instrumentation

The App Start Instrumentation provides insight into how long your application takes to launch. It adds a span from the application launch to the first auto-generated UI transaction.

The SDK differentiates between a cold and a warm start, but doesn't track hot starts/resumes.

- **Cold start**: A cold start refers to an app’s starting from scratch: the system’s process has not, until this start, created the app’s process. Cold starts happen in cases such as your app’s being launched for the first time since the device booted, or since the system killed the app.
- **Warm start**: A warm start encompasses some subset of the operations that take place during a cold start; at the same time, it represents more overhead than a hot start. For instance: The system evicts your app from memory, and then the user re-launches it. The process and the activity need to be restarted, but the task can benefit somewhat from the saved instance state bundle passed into `onCreate()`.

The SDK sets the Span operation to `app.start.cold` for _Cold start_ and `app.start.warm` for _Warm start_.

The SDK uses the `SentryPerformanceProvider` (ContentProvider) creation time as the beginning of the app start and the first `Activity#onResume` call as the end.

<Note>

The app start is only measured if the process is of the importance [RunningAppProcessInfo.IMPORTANCE_FOREGROUND](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/ActivityManager.RunningAppProcessInfo#IMPORTANCE_FOREGROUND), which means the process is running the foreground UI.

</Note>

You can opt out of Android's Activity Instrumentation and App Start Instrumentation using options:

```xml {filename:AndroidManifest.xml}
<application>
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.traces.activity.enable" android:value="false" />
</application>
```

Cold and warm start are Mobile Vitals, which you can learn about in the [full documentation](/product/performance/mobile-vitals).

### Slow and Frozen Frames

<Note>

Supported on Android OS version `7.0` and above.

</Note>

Unresponsive UI and animation hitches annoy users and degrade the user experience. Two measurements to track these types of experiences are _slow frames_ and _frozen frames_. If you want your app to run smoothly, you should try to avoid both. The SDK adds these two measurements for the [Android's Activity](/platforms/android/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#androids-activity-instrumentation) transactions.

Slow and frozen frames are Mobile Vitals, which you can learn about in the [full documentation](/product/performance/mobile-vitals).

### Trace Propagation Targets

Sentry adds an extra header with the trace id in the outgoing HTTP requests to continue the transaction in the backend.
You can set the `tracePropagationTarget` option to filter which requests Sentry adds the extra header to.
For example, to ensure that only your app backend will receive the trace id.

```java
import io.sentry.android.core.SentryAndroid;

SentryAndroid.init(this, options -> {
    final List<String> targets = new ArrayList<>();
    targets.add("myapp.com");
    options.setTracePropagationTargets(targets);
});
```

```kotlin
import io.sentry.android.core.SentryAndroid

SentryAndroid.init(this) { options ->
    options.setTracePropagationTargets(listOf("myapp.com"))
}
```

The option may contain a list of Strings (including regular expressions) which are matched against the URLs of outgoing requests. If one of the entries in the list matches the URL of an outgoing request, trace data will be attached to that request. String entries do not have to be full matches, meaning the URL of a request is matched when it contains a string provided through the option.
If `tracePropagationTargets` is not provided, trace data is attached to every outgoing request from the instrumented client.

#### AndroidX Support

Sentry uses the `androidx.core` library for detecting [slow and frozen frames](#slow-and-frozen-frames). This is necessary to produce accurate results across all Android OS versions.

We check for availability at runtime, so if you're not using `androidx.core`, you can remove it from Sentry's transitive dependencies.

```Groovy
implementation ('io.sentry:sentry-android:{{@inject packages.version('sentry.java.android', '4.2.0') }}') {
    exclude group: 'androidx.core', module: 'core'
}
```

Note that by removing this transitive dependency, slow and frozen frames won't be reported.

### OkHttp Library Instrumentation

The OkHttp's instrumentation, once added the `SentryOkHttpInterceptor`, starts a span out of the active span bound to the scope for each HTTP Request. The SDK sets the span `operation` to `http.client` and `description` to request `$METHOD $url`; for example, `GET https://sentry.io`.

The span finishes once the request has been executed. The span `status` depends on either the HTTP Response `code` or `SpanStatus.INTERNAL_ERROR` if the `code` does not match any of Sentry's `SpanStatus`.

When the HTTP request throws an `IOException`, Sentry's SDK associates this exception to the running span. If you haven't set the SDK to swallow the exception and capture it, the span and SentryEvent will be linked when viewing it on the **Issue Details** page in sentry.io.

For more information see our [OkHttp integration](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/okhttp/).

### Apollo GraphQL Instrumentation

The Apollo's instrumentation, once added the `SentryApolloInterceptor`, starts a span out of the active span bound to the scope for each GraphQL Request. The SDK sets the span `operation` to the GraphQL operation name and `description` to request `$operation.type and $operation.name`; for example, `query LaunchDetails`.

The span finishes once the request has been executed. The span `status` depends on either the HTTP Response `code` or `SpanStatus.INTERNAL_ERROR` if the `code` does not match any of Sentry's `SpanStatus`.

When the Apollo request throws an `ApolloException`, Sentry's SDK associates this exception to the running span. If you haven't set the SDK to swallow the exception and capture it, the span and SentryEvent will be linked when viewing it on the **Issue Details** page in sentry.io.

For more information see our [Apollo integration](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/apollo/).

### SQLite and Room Instrumentation

The [Sentry Android Gradle Plugin](/platforms/android/configuration/gradle/) does tracing auto instrumentation using bytecode manipulation for `androidx.sqlite` and `androidx.room` libraries.

The Plugin injects a code snippet that starts a span out of the active span bound to the scope for each `CRUD` operation. The SDK sets the span `operation` to `db` and `description` to the SQL Query if available.

The span finishes once the operation has been executed. The span `status` is set to `SpanStatus.OK` if successful or `SpanStatus.INTERNAL_ERROR` if there was any error.

When the operation throws an `Exception`, Sentry's SDK associates this exception to the running span. If you haven't set the SDK to swallow the exception and capture it, the span and SentryEvent will be linked when viewing it on the **Issue Details** page in sentry.io.

For more information see our [Room and SQLite integration](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/room-and-sqlite/).

### File I/O Instrumentation

The [Sentry Android Gradle Plugin](/platforms/android/configuration/gradle/) does tracing auto instrumentation using bytecode manipulation for `java.io.FileInputStream`, `java.io.FileOutputStream`, `java.io.FileReader`, and `java.io.FileWriter`.

The plugin replaces the aforementioned classes with custom Sentry-specific implementations.

The Sentry-specific file I/O implementation starts a span out of the active span, bound to the scope for each file I/O operation. The SDK sets the span `operation` to `file.write`/`file.read` and `description` to `filename (pretty-printed file size)`, e.g. `file.txt (123 kB)`

In addition, the span contains other useful information such as `file.size` (raw number of bytes) and `file.path` (an absolute path to the file) as part of the `data` payload.

The span finishes once the operation has been executed. The span `status` is set to `SpanStatus.OK` if successful or `SpanStatus.INTERNAL_ERROR` if there was any error.

When the operation throws an `Exception`, Sentry's SDK associates this exception to the running span. If you haven't set the SDK to swallow the exception and capture it, the span and SentryEvent will be linked when viewing it on the **Issue Details** page in sentry.io.

For more information see our [file I/O integration](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/file-io/).

### User Interaction Instrumentation

The UI instrumentation, once enabled, captures transactions for a set of different user interactions, which include clicks, scrolls, and swipes. User interaction instrumentation is available for both classic Android Views as well as Jetpack Compose.

This feature is disabled by default, but you can enable it by setting:

```xml {filename:AndroidManifest.xml}
<application>
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.traces.user-interaction.enable" android:value="true" />
</application>
```

#### User Interaction Instrumentation for Classic Android View System

_(New in version 6.0.0)_

The SDK composes the transaction name out of the host `Activity` and the `id` of the view that captured the user interaction — for example, for `LoginActivity.login_button`. The transaction operation is set to `ui.action` plus the interaction type (one of `click`, `scroll`, or `swipe`).

<Note>

If the view doesn't have the `id` assigned, the transaction won't be captured because it can't be uniquely identified otherwise.

</Note>

#### User Interaction Instrumentation for Jetpack Compose

_(New in version 6.10.0)_

The SDK composes the transaction name out of the host `Activity` and the `tag` set by way of the `Modifier.testTag("<tag>")` of the `Composable` (for example, `LoginActivity.login_button`). The transaction operation is set to `ui.action` plus the interaction type (one of `click`, `scroll`, or `swipe`).

```kotlin
import androidx.compose.ui.platform.testTag

@Composable
fun LoginScreen() {
  Column {
    // ...
    Button(
        modifier = Modifier.testTag("button_login"),
        onClick = { TODO() }) {
        Text(text = "Login")
    }
  }
}
```

<Note>

If the `@Composable` doesn't have a `testTag` modifier applied, the transaction won't be captured because it can't be uniquely identified. To capture a transaction for the `@Composable`, you must either add a `testTag` modifier or enable automatic `@Composable` tagging.

</Note>

##### Automatic `@Composable` tagging using the Sentry Kotlin Compiler Plugin

<Note>

The Sentry Kotlin Compiler plugin is considered _experimental_. Give it a try and provide early feedback [on GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-android-gradle-plugin).

</Note>

The <PlatformLink to="/enhance-errors/kotlin-compiler-plugin/">Sentry Kotlin Compiler Plugin</PlatformLink> can automatically enrich your `@Composable` functions during compilation with a tag name, based on the function name of your `@Composable`. In order to use this feature, the Sentry Kotlin Compiler plugin needs to be applied to all modules, which contain `@Composable` elements.

```groovy {filename:app/build.gradle}
plugins {
  id "io.sentry.kotlin.compiler.gradle" version "{{@inject packages.version('sentry.kotlin.compiler-plugin', '3.7.0') }}"
}
```

```kotlin {filename:app/build.gradle.kts}
plugins {
  id("io.sentry.kotlin.compiler.gradle") version "{{@inject packages.version('sentry.kotlin.compiler-plugin', '3.7.0') }}"
}
```

#### Transaction Lifetime

The transaction finishes automatically after it reaches the specified [idleTimeout](/platforms/android/configuration/options/#idle-timeout) and all of its child spans are finished. The `idleTimeoout` defaults to `3000` milliseconds (three seconds). You can also disable the idle timeout by setting it to `null`, but the transaction must be finished manually in this case.

<Note>

If the UI transaction has idled, but didn't have any child spans added, it will be dropped.

</Note>

To finish the transaction manually, you can:

```java
import io.sentry.Sentry;

ISpan span = Sentry.getSpan();
if (span != null) {
  span.finish();
}
```

```kotlin
import io.sentry.Sentry

val span = Sentry.getSpan()
span?.finish()
```

If the host `Activity` transitions into a non-interactive state (for example, `onPause`), the UI transaction will be scheduled to finish automatically (as soon as all of its child spans are finished).

Transactions are always bound to the `Scope` automatically if there's none set. Because of that, you can create spans using custom instrumentation, and those spans will be automatically associated with the running UI transaction.

```java
import java.lang.Exception;

import io.sentry.ISpan;
import io.sentry.Sentry;
import io.sentry.SpanStatus;

void loadUserDataOnClick() {
  ISpan span = Sentry.getSpan();
  if (span != null) {
    ISpan innerSpan = span.startChild("loadUserData");
    // omitted code
    innerSpan.finish();
  }
}
```

```kotlin
import java.lang.Exception

import io.sentry.Sentry
import io.sentry.SpanStatus

fun loadUserDataOnClick() {
  val span = Sentry.getSpan()
  span?.let {
    val innerSpan = it.startChild("loadUserData")
    // omitted code
    innerSpan.finish()
  }
}
```

When the UI transaction is not finished yet, but the user makes a new interaction, the SDK automatically finishes the previous UI transaction. This is because only one transaction can be bound to the scope at a time. However, if the same view has been interacted with (for example, a `RecyclerView` was scrolled again within the `idleTimeout` window), the idle timer will be reset and the transaction duration will be extended with the `idleTimeout` value.

### Time to Initial Display

_(New in version 6.10.0)_

Time to initial display provides insight into how long it takes your Activities to launch and draw their first frame, by adding a span for each launch of an Activity. The SDK sets the span operation to `ui.load.initial-display` and the span description to the Activity's name followed by `initial display`, for example, `MainActivity initial display`.

The span starts when each Activity is launched, which is defined as an application launch for the first Activity, and the `onPause` method of the previous Activity for each subsequent Activity launched.

The span finishes after the Activity draws its first frame.

Time to initial display is dependent on having an active transaction bound to the scope. Ideally, it should be used along with [Android's Activity Instrumentation](/platforms/android/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#androids-activity-instrumentation), which starts a transaction and binds it to the scope automatically.

### Time to Full Display

_(New in version 6.14.0)_

Time to full display provides insight into how long it would take your Activities to launch and load all of their content, by adding a span for each launch of an Activity. The SDK sets the span operation to `ui.load.full-display` and the span description to the Activity's name followed by `full display`, for example, `MainActivity full display`.

The span starts when each Activity is launched, which is defined as the application launch for the first Activity, and the `onPause` method of the previous Activity for each subsequent Activity launched.

_Time to full display is disabled by default, but you can enable it by setting:_

```xml {filename:AndroidManifest.xml}
<application>
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.traces.time-to-full-display.enable" android:value="true" />
</application>
```

_The span has to be finished manually, by using:_

```java
import io.sentry.Sentry;

Sentry.reportFullyDisplayed();
```

```kotlin
import io.sentry.Sentry

Sentry.reportFullyDisplayed()
```

Time to full display is dependent on having an active transaction bound to the scope. Ideally, it should be used along with [Android's Activity Instrumentation](/platforms/android/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#androids-activity-instrumentation), which starts a transaction and binds it to the scope automatically.

If the span finishes through the API, its `status` is set to `SpanStatus.OK`. If the span doesn't finish after 30 seconds, it is finished by the SDK automatically, and its `status` is set to `SpanStatus.DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`.
If the span finishes before the Activity is first drawn and displayed as measured by the `Time to initial display`, the reported time will be shifted to `Time to initial display` measured time.
