<Note>

Capturing transactions requires that you first <PlatformLink to="/performance/">set up performance monitoring</PlatformLink> if you haven't already.

Supported in Sentry's Android SDK version `4.3.0` and above.

### Android's Activity Instrumentation

The Activity's instrumentation, once enabled, captures transactions for each launch of an Activity. The SDK sets the Transaction name to the name of the Activity, for example, `MainActivity`, and Transaction operation to `navigation`.

The transaction starts before each Activity's `onCreate` method is called.

_The Activity's instrumentation is enabled by default, but you may disable it by setting:_

```xml {filename:AndroidManifest.xml}
<manifest>
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.traces.activity.enable" android:value="false" />
</manifest>
```

The transaction finishes after each Activity's `onResume` method is executed.

_The transaction finishes automatically, but you may disable it by setting:_

```xml {filename:AndroidManifest.xml}
<manifest>
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.traces.activity.auto-finish.enable" android:value="false" />
</manifest>
```

We offer the possibility to finish the transaction manually. For example, you might want to finish the transaction after an API call triggered on Activity's `onCreate` and shown the data to the user. To achieve that you can do:

```java
import io.sentry.Sentry;

ISpan span = Sentry.getSpan();
if (span != null) {
  span.finish();
}
```

```kotlin
import io.sentry.Sentry

val span = Sentry.getSpan()
span?.finish()
```

In case that the user left this Activity before you've finished the transaction manually, the SDK finishes the transaction automatically when the `onDestroy` method is called.

Transactions are always bound to the Scope automatically if there's none set. Because of that, you may create spans using manual instrumentation, and those spans will be automatically associated with the Activity's running transaction.

```java
import java.lang.Exception;

import io.sentry.ISpan;
import io.sentry.Sentry;
import io.sentry.SpanStatus;

void displayUserData() {
  ISpan span = Sentry.getSpan();
  if (span != null) {
    ISpan innerSpan = span.startChild("displayUserData");
    try {
      // omitted code
    } catch (Exception e) {
      innerSpan.setThrowable(e);
      innerSpan.setStatus(SpanStatus.NOT_FOUND);
      throw e;
    } finally {
      innerSpan.finish();
    }
  }
}
```

```kotlin
import java.lang.Exception

import io.sentry.Sentry
import io.sentry.SpanStatus

fun displayUserData() {
  val span = Sentry.getSpan()
  span?.let {
    val innerSpan = it.startChild("displayUserData")

    try {
      // omitted code
    } catch (e: Exception) {
      innerSpan.throwable = e
      innerSpan.status = SpanStatus.NOT_FOUND
      throw e
    } finally {
      innerSpan.finish()
    }
  }
}
```

When you didn't finish the transaction yet, but you start a new Activity, the SDK always automatically finishes the previous Activity transaction. This is due to the fact that only one transaction at a time can be bound to the Scope. To work around that, you may create transactions manually using the custom instrumentation and its instance to start spans instead of the Static API.

### OkHttp library Instrumentation

The OkHttp's instrumentation, once added the `SentryOkHttpInterceptor`, starts a Span out of the running Transaction bound to the Scope for each HTTP Request. The SDK sets the Span `operation` to `http.client` and `description` to Request `$method and $URL`, for example, `GET https://sentry.io`

The Span finishes once the Request has been executed, the Span `status` will be depending on the HTTP Response `code` or `SpanStatus.INTERNAL_ERROR` if the `code` does not match any of Sentry's `SpanStatus`.

When the HTTP Request throws an `IOException`, Sentry's SDK associates this exception to the running Span, in case you don't swallow the exception and capture it, Span and SentryEvent on Sentry dashboard will be linked.
