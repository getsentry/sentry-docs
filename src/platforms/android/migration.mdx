## Migrating from `sentry-android 2.x` to `sentry-android 3.x`

**Package changes**

The package `io.sentry.core` has been renamed to `io.sentry`. To compile correctly, replace the strings on all the usages from `io.sentry.core.` to `io.sentry.`

Other than that, the APIs didn't change. Release Heath sets by default. If you prefer not to track the health of your releases, disable it with:

````xml
<application>
  <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.session-tracking.enable" android:value="false" />
</application>

## Migrating from `sentry-android 1.x` to `sentry-android 2.x`

With Sentry Android, we've updated the API to resemble the [Unified API](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/unified-api/) more closely. And now that the SDK isn't built on top of `sentry-java`, Sentry Android has more Android-specific features.

If you want to upgrade from the previous version of the SDK, please check the following sections of changes that may need updating in your code.

### Configuration

The file `sentry.properties` used by the previous version of the SDK has been discontinued. Configurations for the new SDK are in `AndroidManifest.xml` or directly in the code.

Example of the configuration in the Manifest:

```xml
<application>
    <!-- Example of the Sentry DSN setting -->
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.dsn" android:value="___PUBLIC_DSN__" />
</application>
````

If you want to set the configuration manually in the code, you need to initialize the SDK with `SentryAndroid.init()` --- described in [Installation](#installation) --- in the same file as `SentryAndroidOptions`, which holds configuration items.

### Installation

The new SDK can initialize automatically, all you need to do is provide the DSN in your Manifest file, as shown in the previous example in [Configuration](#configuration).

**Manual Installation**

If you want to register any callback to filter and modify events and/or breadcrumbs, or if you want to provide the configuration values via code, you need to initialize the SDK using the `SentryAndroid.init()`.

To initialize the SDK manually:

- Disable the `auto-init` feature by providing the following line in the manifest:

  ```xml
  <application>
      <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.auto-init" android:value="false" />
  </application>
  ```

- Initialize the SDK directly in your application:

  ```java
  SentryAndroid.init(context, options -> {
      options.setDsn("___PUBLIC_DSN___");
  });
  ```

### Releases

Please note that the new SDK will send with each event a release version in a different format than the previous SDK.

If you are using the [GitHub](/product/integrations/github/) or [GitLab](/product/integrations/gitlab/) integrations, you need to do one of the following:

- Use the new format LINK: ([https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/android/#releases](/platforms/android/#releases))
- Set the release in your `AndroidManifest.xml`
- Change your code as described in the configuration section

### API

**Set tag**

_Old_:

```java

```java
try {
    int x = 1 / 0;
} catch (Exception e) {
    Sentry.captureException(e);
}
```

**Capture a message**

_Old_:

Sentry.captureMessage("This is a test", SentryLevel.WARNING); // or specific level
```

```

**User**

_Old_:

```java
