## Installation

If you don't want the Sentry Gradle plugin to install the Sentry SDK automatically, you can define the dependency directly in the `build.gradle` file of your app module.

```groovy {filename:app/build.gradle}
// Make sure mavenCentral is there.
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

// Enable Java 1.8 source compatibility if you haven't yet.
android {
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
}

// Add Sentry's SDK as a dependency.
dependencies {
    implementation 'io.sentry:sentry-android:{{ packages.version('sentry.java.android', '4.2.0') }}'
}
```

```kotlin {filename:app/build.gradle.kts}
// Make sure mavenCentral is there.
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

// Enable Java 1.8 source compatibility if you haven't yet.
android {
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
}

// Add Sentry's SDK as a dependency.
dependencies {
    implementation("io.sentry:sentry-android:{{ packages.version('sentry.java.android', '4.2.0') }}")
}
```

<Note>

The [NDK integration](/platforms/android/using-ndk/) comes packaged with the SDK and requires API level 16, though other levels are supported. If you're using multiple Sentry dependencies, you can add a [bill of materials](/platforms/android/configuration/bill-of-materials) to avoid specifying the version of each dependency.
