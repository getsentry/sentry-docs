The Android SDK uses two implementations to detect ANRs:
 - Reading [ApplicationExitInfo](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/ApplicationExitInfo) for devices running Android 11 and above (v2)
 - A Watchdog thread for devices running Android version below 11 (v1)

The new implementation (v2) is more accurate and enables us to be on-par with Google Play Console with regards to reported ANR events and [ANR rate](/platforms/android/performance/instrumentation/performance-metrics/#application-not-responding-anr-rate). We also can capture a thread dump with some additional information like held locks to help you resolve ANRs more efficiently.

<Note>

The v1 approach (Watchdog) still has some advantages over v2, for example, capturing screenshots and transactions with profiles at the time of ANR. Therefore, we're considering support both approaches working alongside each other. Please, upvote this [issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/issues/2693) and share your feedback, if you have a case for v1 and v2 working together.

</Note>

## Watchdog (v1)

Whenever the main UI thread of the application is blocked for more than five seconds, the SDK will report the problem to the server.

<Note>

Sentry does not report the ANR if the application is in debug mode.

</Note>

You can turn off monitoring the ANR by adding the following to your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml {filename:AndroidManifest.xml}
<application>
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.anr.enable" android:value="false" />
</application>
```

You can also specify how long the thread should be blocked before the ANR is reported. Provide the duration in the attribute `io.sentry.anr.timeout-interval-millis` in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml {filename:AndroidManifest.xml}
<application>
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.anr.timeout-interval-millis" android:value="2000" />
</application>
```

## ApplicationExitInfo (v2)

The new approach reads the [ApplicationExitInfo](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/ApplicationExitInfo) API on the next app launch
and asynchronously sends ANR events for each ANR in the history, enriching only the latest one with breadcrumbs, contexts, tags, etc. 

The new ANR detection is controlled by the same flag as the old one:

```xml {filename:AndroidManifest.xml}
<application>
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.anr.enable" android:value="false" />
</application>
```
