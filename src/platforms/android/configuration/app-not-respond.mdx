Whenever the main UI thread of the application is blocked for more than five seconds, the SDK will report the problem to the server.

<Note>

Sentry does not report the ANR if the application is in debug mode.

</Note>

You can turn off monitoring the ANR by adding the following to your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml {filename:AndroidManifest.xml}
<application>
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.anr.enable" android:value="false" />
</application>
```

You can also specify how long the thread should be blocked before the ANR is reported. Provide the duration in the attribute `io.sentry.anr.timeout-interval-mills` in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml {filename:AndroidManifest.xml}
<application>
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.anr.timeout-interval-mills" android:value="2000" />
</application>
```
