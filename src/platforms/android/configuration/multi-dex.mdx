If you're using Multi-Dex and our SDK, we recommend updating your Multi-Dex configuration:

```groovy {filename:app/build.gradle}
release {
    multiDexKeepProguard file('multidex-config.pro')
}
```

Then add to `multidex-config.pro` the following lines:

```
-keep class io.sentry.android.core.SentryAndroidOptions
-keep class io.sentry.android.ndk.SentryNdk
```

If you experience issues like `Could not find class` on devices running the `Dalvik VM`, you may expand the above rules to keep the necessary classes in the main dex file.
