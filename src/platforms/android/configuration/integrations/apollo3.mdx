<Note>

Capturing transactions requires that you first <PlatformLink to="/performance/">set up performance monitoring</PlatformLink> if you haven't already.

</Note>

Sentry Apollo3 integration provides the `SentryApollo3Interceptor` and the `SentryApollo3HttpInterceptor`, which create a span for each outgoing HTTP request executed with an [Apollo Kotlin](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin) GraphQL client. For easier usage, the integration also provides extension functions on the `ApolloClient.Builder`.

## Install

```groovy {tabTitle:Gradle}
implementation 'io.sentry:sentry-apollo-3:{{@inject packages.version('sentry.java.apollo-3', '6.1.4') }}'
```

For other dependency managers, see the [central Maven repository](https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.sentry/sentry-apollo-3).

## Configure With Extension

Add `Interceptors` to `ApolloClient.Builder` using `ApolloBuilderExtensions`:

```java
import com.apollographql.apollo3.ApolloClient;
import io.sentry.apollo3.SentryApolloBuilderExtensionsKt;

ApolloClient apollo = SentryApolloBuilderExtensionsKt
    .sentryTracing(new ApolloClient.Builder())
    .serverUrl("https://your-api-host/")
    .build();
```

```kotlin
import com.apollographql.apollo3.ApolloClient
import io.sentry.apollo3.sentryTracing

val apollo = ApolloClient.builder()
    .serverUrl("https://your-api-host/")
    .sentryTracing()
    .build()
```

## Manual Configuration

When using a custom `NetworkTransport`, the `SentryInterceptors` need to be added manually, because `HttpInterceptors` need to be added to the `NetworkTransport`:

```java
import com.apollographql.apollo3.ApolloClient;
import com.apollographql.apollo3.network.http.HttpNetworkTransport;
import io.sentry.apollo3.SentryApollo3HttpInterceptor;
import io.sentry.apollo3.SentryApollo3Interceptor;

ApolloClient apollo = new ApolloClient.Builder()
        .networkTransport(
            new HttpNetworkTransport.Builder()
                .serverUrl("https://your-api-host/")
                .addInterceptor(new SentryApollo3HttpInterceptor())
                .build())
        .addInterceptor(new SentryApollo3Interceptor())
        .build();
```

```kotlin
import com.apollographql.apollo3.ApolloClient
import io.sentry.apollo3.SentryApollo3HttpInterceptor
import io.sentry.apollo3.SentryApollo3Interceptor
import com.apollographql.apollo3.network.http.HttpNetworkTransport

val apollo = ApolloClient.builder()
    .networkTransport(
        HttpNetworkTransport.Builder()
            .serverUrl("https://apollo-fullstack-tutorial.herokuapp.com/graphql")
            .addInterceptor(SentryApollo3HttpInterceptor())
            .build()
    )
    .addInterceptor(SentryApollo3Interceptor())
    .build()
```

## Modify or Drop Spans

Spans created around requests can be modified or dropped using `SentryApollo3HttpInterceptor.BeforeSpanCallback` passed to `SentryApollo3HttpInterceptor` or the `sentryTracing` extension function:

```java
import com.apollographql.apollo3.ApolloClient;
import io.sentry.apollo3.SentryApolloBuilderExtensionsKt;

ApolloClient apollo = SentryApolloBuilderExtensionsKt.sentryTracing(
            new ApolloClient.Builder(),
            (span, request, response) -> {
              if ("LaunchDetails".equals(span.getOperation())) {
                span.setTag("tag-name", "tag-value");
              }
              return span;
            })
        .serverUrl("https://your-api-host/")
        .build();
```

```kotlin
import com.apollographql.apollo3.ApolloClient
import io.sentry.apollo3.sentryTracing

val apollo = ApolloClient.builder()
    .serverUrl("https://apollo-fullstack-tutorial.herokuapp.com/graphql")
    .sentryTracing { span, request, response ->
        if ("LaunchDetails" == span.operation) {
            span.setTag("tag-name", "tag-value")
        }
        span
    }
    .build()
```

## GraphQL Client Errors

Once enabled, this feature will automatically capture GraphQL client errors such as bad operations and response codes, and report them to Sentry as error events. Each error event will contain the `request` and `response` data, including the `url`, `status_code`, and `data` (stringified `query`).

Sentry will group GraphQL client errors by the `operationName`, `operationType`, and `statusCode`, so that you can easily see the number of errors that happened for each.

This is an opt-in feature and can be enabled by setting the `captureFailedRequests` option to `true`:

```kotlin
import com.apollographql.apollo3.ApolloClient
import io.sentry.apollo3.sentryTracing

val apollo = ApolloClient.builder()
    .serverUrl("https://your-api-host/")
    .sentryTracing(captureFailedRequests = true)
    .build()
```

By default, only GraphQL client errors with a response that includes the [errors](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-Errors) array are captured as error events.

GraphQL client errors from every target (`.*` regular expression) are automatically captured, but you can change this behavior by setting the `failedRequestTargets` option with either a regular expression or a plain `String`. A plain string must contain at least one of the items from the list. Plain strings don't have to be full matches, meaning the URL of a request is matched when it contains a string provided through the option.

```kotlin
import com.apollographql.apollo3.ApolloClient
import io.sentry.apollo3.sentryTracing

val apollo = ApolloClient.builder()
    .serverUrl("https://your-api-host/")
    .sentryTracing(captureFailedRequests = true, failedRequestTargets = listOf("myapi.com"))
    .build()
```

By default, error events won't contain `Headers` or `Cookies`, but you can change this behavior by setting the `sendDefaultPii` option to `true`:

```xml {filename:AndroidManifest.xml}
<application>
  <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.send-default-pii" android:value="true" />
</application>
```

Error events will contain the raw bodies of GraphQL requests and responses, the raw bodies can contain sensitive data, to avoid that, you can do the parametrization of your queries using the [variables](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-Language.Variables) field, using parametrized queries, [Relay](https://docs.sentry.io/product/relay) will run [PII Data Scrubbing](https://docs.sentry.io/product/relay/#pii-data-scrubbing) automatically transforming the values into `[Filtered]`.

Alternatively, you can customize the event and scrub the data yourself.

### Customize or Drop the Error Event

To customize or drop the error event, you need to do a [manual initialization](/platforms/android/configuration/manual-init/) of the Sentry Android SDK.

The captured error event can be customized or dropped with a `BeforeSendCallback`:

```kotlin
import io.sentry.android.core.SentryAndroid
import io.sentry.SentryOptions.BeforeSendCallback
import com.apollographql.apollo3.api.http.HttpRequest
import com.apollographql.apollo3.api.http.HttpResponse
import io.sentry.TypeCheckHint.APOLLO_REQUEST
import io.sentry.TypeCheckHint.APOLLO_RESPONSE

SentryAndroid.init(this) { options ->
  // Add a callback that will be used before the event is sent to Sentry.
  // With this callback, you can modify the event or, when returning null, also discard the event.
  options.beforeSend = BeforeSendCallback { event, hint ->
    val request = hint.getAs(APOLLO_REQUEST, HttpRequest::class.java)
    val response = hint.getAs(APOLLO_RESPONSE, HttpResponse::class.java)

    // customize or drop the event
    event
  }
}
```

### Automatically Captured GraphQL Client Errors and Manually Captured Errors

When `captureFailedRequests` is enabled, some GraphQL client libraries throw unchecked exceptions like `ApolloException` and its implementations. In this case, the error event is captured twice; once by the GraphQL client library and once by the Sentry Android SDK:

```kotlin
import io.sentry.Sentry
import com.apollographql.apollo3.exception.ApolloException

try {
  // If this API call returns the `errors` array, it will be captured as an error event by the `SentryApollo3HttpInterceptor`.
  return apolloClient.query(LaunchDetailsQuery(launchId)).execute()
} catch (e: ApolloException) {
  // Do not manually capture this exception to avoid duplicated error events.
  // Sentry.captureException(e)
}
```

We recommend you identify those errors and **not** capture them manually with the `Sentry.captureException` method.
