On this page, we get you up and running with Sentry's Android SDK, so that it will automatically report errors and exceptions in your application.

## Install

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-install" />

<Note><markdown>

For the minimal required API level, see [Advanced usage](usage/advanced-usage/).

</markdown></Note>

## Configure

After you’ve completed setting up a project in Sentry, Sentry will give you a value which we call a DSN or Data Source Name. It looks a lot like a standard URL, but it’s just a representation of the configuration required by the Sentry SDKs. It consists of a few pieces, including the protocol, public key, the server address, and the project identifier.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-config" />

## Verify

Great! Now that you’ve completed setting up the SDK, maybe you want to quickly test out how Sentry works. Start by capturing an exception:

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-verify" />

Then, you can see the error in your dashboard:
