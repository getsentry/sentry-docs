Sentry's Apollo3 integration provides both the `SentryApollo3Interceptor` and the `SentryApollo3HttpInterceptor`, which create a span for each outgoing HTTP request executed with an [Apollo Kotlin](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin) GraphQL client. The integration also provides extension functions on the `ApolloClient.Builder`.

## Install

To install Apollo3:

```groovy {tabTitle:Gradle}
implementation 'io.sentry:sentry-apollo-3:{{@inject packages.version('sentry.java.apollo-3', '6.1.4') }}'
```

For other dependency managers, see the [central Maven repository](https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.sentry/sentry-apollo-3).

## Configure With Extension

Add `Interceptors` to `ApolloClient.Builder` using `ApolloBuilderExtensions`:

```java
import com.apollographql.apollo3.ApolloClient;
import io.sentry.apollo3.SentryApolloBuilderExtensionsKt;

ApolloClient apollo = SentryApolloBuilderExtensionsKt
    .sentryTracing(new ApolloClient.Builder())
    .serverUrl("https://your-api-host/")
    .build();
```

```kotlin
import com.apollographql.apollo3.ApolloClient
import io.sentry.apollo3.sentryTracing

val apollo = ApolloClient.builder()
    .serverUrl("https://your-api-host/")
    .sentryTracing()
    .build()
```

## Manual Configuration

Because `HttpInterceptors` need to be added to the `NetworkTransport`, the `SentryInterceptors` need to be added manually if you're using a custom `NetworkTransport`:

```java
import com.apollographql.apollo3.ApolloClient;
import com.apollographql.apollo3.network.http.HttpNetworkTransport;
import io.sentry.apollo3.SentryApollo3HttpInterceptor;
import io.sentry.apollo3.SentryApollo3Interceptor;

ApolloClient apollo = new ApolloClient.Builder()
        .networkTransport(
            new HttpNetworkTransport.Builder()
                .serverUrl("https://your-api-host/")
                .addInterceptor(new SentryApollo3HttpInterceptor())
                .build())
        .addInterceptor(new SentryApollo3Interceptor())
        .build();
```

```kotlin
import com.apollographql.apollo3.ApolloClient
import io.sentry.apollo3.SentryApollo3HttpInterceptor
import io.sentry.apollo3.SentryApollo3Interceptor
import com.apollographql.apollo3.network.http.HttpNetworkTransport

val apollo = ApolloClient.builder()
    .networkTransport(
        HttpNetworkTransport.Builder()
            .serverUrl("https://apollo-fullstack-tutorial.herokuapp.com/graphql")
            .addInterceptor(SentryApollo3HttpInterceptor())
            .build()
    )
    .addInterceptor(SentryApollo3Interceptor())
    .build()
```

## Modify or Drop Spans

Spans created around requests can be modified or dropped using `SentryApollo3HttpInterceptor.BeforeSpanCallback` passed to `SentryApollo3HttpInterceptor` or the `sentryTracing` extension function:

```java
import com.apollographql.apollo3.ApolloClient;
import io.sentry.apollo3.SentryApolloBuilderExtensionsKt;

ApolloClient apollo = SentryApolloBuilderExtensionsKt.sentryTracing(
            new ApolloClient.Builder(),
            (span, request, response) -> {
              if ("LaunchDetails".equals(span.getOperation())) {
                span.setTag("tag-name", "tag-value");
              }
              return span;
            })
        .serverUrl("https://your-api-host/")
        .build();
```

```kotlin
import com.apollographql.apollo3.ApolloClient
import io.sentry.apollo3.sentryTracing

val apollo = ApolloClient.builder()
    .serverUrl("https://apollo-fullstack-tutorial.herokuapp.com/graphql")
    .sentryTracing { span, request, response ->
        if ("LaunchDetails" == span.operation) {
            span.setTag("tag-name", "tag-value")
        }
        span
    }
    .build()
```

## GraphQL Client Errors

Once enabled, this feature will automatically capture GraphQL client errors such as bad operations and response codes, and report them to Sentry as error events. Each error event will contain the `request` and `response` data, including the `url`, `status_code`, and `data` (stringified `query`).

Sentry will group GraphQL client errors by the `operationName`, `operationType`, and `statusCode`, so that you can easily see the number of errors that happened for each.

This is an opt-in feature and can be enabled by setting the `captureFailedRequests` option to `true`:

```kotlin
import com.apollographql.apollo3.ApolloClient
import io.sentry.apollo3.sentryTracing

val apollo = ApolloClient.builder()
    .serverUrl("https://your-api-host/")
    .sentryTracing(captureFailedRequests = true)
    .build()
```

By default, only GraphQL client errors with a response that includes the [errors](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-Errors) array will be captured as error events.

GraphQL client errors from every target (`.*` regular expression) are automatically captured, but you can change this behavior by setting the `failedRequestTargets` option with either a regular expression or a plain `String`. A plain string must contain at least one of the items from the list. Plain strings don't have to be full matches, meaning the URL of a request is matched when it contains a string provided through the option.

```kotlin
import com.apollographql.apollo3.ApolloClient
import io.sentry.apollo3.sentryTracing

val apollo = ApolloClient.builder()
    .serverUrl("https://your-api-host/")
    .sentryTracing(captureFailedRequests = true, failedRequestTargets = listOf("myapi.com"))
    .build()
```

By default, error events won't contain `Headers` or `Cookies`, but you can change this behavior by setting the `sendDefaultPii` option to `true`:

```xml {filename:AndroidManifest.xml}
<application>
  <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.send-default-pii" android:value="true" />
</application>
```

Error events will contain the raw bodies of GraphQL requests and responses, which may include sensitive data. To avoid this, parameterize your queries using the [variables](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-Language.Variables) field. [Relay](/product/relay) will then run [PII Data Scrubbing](/product/relay/#pii-data-scrubbing), automatically transforming values into `[Filtered]`.

Alternatively, you can customize the event and scrub the data yourself.

### Customize or Drop the Error Event

To customize or drop the error event, you'll need to do a [manual initialization](/platforms/android/configuration/manual-init/#manual-initialization) of the Sentry Android SDK. The captured error event can then be customized or dropped with a `BeforeSendCallback`:

```kotlin
import io.sentry.android.core.SentryAndroid
import io.sentry.SentryOptions.BeforeSendCallback
import com.apollographql.apollo3.api.http.HttpRequest
import com.apollographql.apollo3.api.http.HttpResponse
import io.sentry.TypeCheckHint.APOLLO_REQUEST
import io.sentry.TypeCheckHint.APOLLO_RESPONSE

SentryAndroid.init(this) { options ->
  // Add a callback that will be used before the event is sent to Sentry.
  // With this callback, you can modify the event or, when returning null, also discard the event.
  options.beforeSend = BeforeSendCallback { event, hint ->
    val request = hint.getAs(APOLLO_REQUEST, HttpRequest::class.java)
    val response = hint.getAs(APOLLO_RESPONSE, HttpResponse::class.java)

    // customize or drop the event
    event
  }
}
```

### Automatically and Manually Captured GraphQL Client Errors

When `captureFailedRequests` is enabled, some GraphQL client libraries will throw unchecked exceptions, such as the `ApolloException` and its implementations. This means the error event will be captured by both the GraphQL client library and the Sentry Android SDK. To avoid this, we recommend identifying these errors and using the `Sentry.captureException` method instead of capturing them manually:

```kotlin
import io.sentry.Sentry
import com.apollographql.apollo3.exception.ApolloException

try {
  // If this API call returns the `errors` array, it will be captured as an error event by the `SentryApollo3HttpInterceptor`.
  return apolloClient.query(LaunchDetailsQuery(launchId)).execute()
} catch (e: ApolloException) {
  // Do not manually capture this exception to avoid duplicated error events.
  // Sentry.captureException(e)
}
```
