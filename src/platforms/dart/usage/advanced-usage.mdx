## Requirements

- For the usage of the Dart SDK, the minimal required Dart SDK version is `2.12.0`.

## Automatic Breadcrumbs

To track automatic [Breadcrumbs for HTTP requests](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/event-payloads/breadcrumbs/#breadcrumb-types), you can add a Sentry wrapper that does it automatically for you.

This is only possible if you are using the [http.Client](https://pub.dev/documentation/http/latest/http/Client-class.html) class from the [http](https://pub.dev/packages/http) library.

The `SentryHttpClient` can be used as a standalone client like this:

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';

final client = SentryHttpClient();
try {
  final url = 'https://example.com/whatsit/create';
  final response = await client.post(url, body: {
    'name': 'doodle',
    'color': 'blue',
  });
  print('Response body: ${response.body}');
} finally {
  client.close();
}
```

The `SentryHttpClient` can also be used as a wrapper for your own `HTTP Client`:

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';

final myClient = http.Client();
final client = SentryHttpClient(client: myClient);
try {
  final url = 'https://example.com/whatsit/create';
  final response = await client.post(url, body: {
    'name': 'doodle',
    'color': 'blue',
  });
  print('Response body: ${response.body}');
} finally {
  client.close();
}
```

## Reporting Bad HTTP Requests as Errors

The `SentryHttpClient` can also catch exceptions that may occur during requests â€” for example [`SocketException`](https://api.dart.dev/stable/2.13.4/dart-io/SocketException-class.html).
This is currently an opt-in feature. The following example shows how to enable it.

```dart
import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';

var client = SentryHttpClient(captureFailedRequests: true);
try {
var uriResponse = await client.post('https://example.com/whatsit/create',
     body: {'name': 'doodle', 'color': 'blue'});
 print(await client.get(uriResponse.bodyFields['uri']));
} finally {
 client.close();
}
```

Furthermore you can track HTTP requests that you consider bad. In the
following example, exceptions are captured for each request
with a status code within the range of 400 to 404, and also for 500.

```dart
import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';

var client = SentryHttpClient(
  failedRequestStatusCodes: [
    SentryStatusCode.range(400, 404),
    SentryStatusCode(500),
  ],
);

try {
var uriResponse = await client.post('https://example.com/whatsit/create',
     body: {'name': 'doodle', 'color': 'blue'});
 print(await client.get(uriResponse.bodyFields['uri']));
} finally {
 client.close();
}
```

## Performance Monitoring for HTTP Requests

The `SentryHttpClient` starts a span out of the active span bound to the scope for each HTTP Request.
This is currently an opt-in feature. The following example shows how to enable it.

```dart
import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';

final transaction = Sentry.startTransaction(
  'webrequest',
  'request',
  bindToScope: true,
);

var client = SentryHttpClient(networkTracing: true);
try {
var uriResponse = await client.post('https://example.com/whatsit/create',
     body: {'name': 'doodle', 'color': 'blue'});
 print(await client.get(uriResponse.bodyFields['uri']));
} finally {
 client.close();
}

await transaction.finish(status: SpanStatus.ok());
```

## Tips for Catching Errors

- Use a `try/catch` block
- Use a `catchError` block for `Futures`
- `Isolate` errors on the `current` Isolate which is the equivalent of a main/UI thread, e.g. using `Isolate.current.addErrorListener`, are captured automatically (Only for non-Web Apps).
- For your own `Isolates`, add an `ErrorListener` and call `Sentry.captureException`
