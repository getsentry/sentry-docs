## Requirements

- For the usage of the Dart SDK, the minimal required Dart SDK version is `2.12.0`.

## Reporting Bad HTTP Requests as Errors

The `SentryHttpClient` can also catch exceptions that may occur during requests â€” for example [`SocketException`](https://api.dart.dev/stable/2.13.4/dart-io/SocketException-class.html).
This is currently an opt-in feature. The following example shows how to enable it.

```dart
import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';

var client = SentryHttpClient(captureFailedRequests: true);
try {
var uriResponse = await client.post('https://example.com/whatsit/create',
     body: {'name': 'doodle', 'color': 'blue'});
 print(await client.get(uriResponse.bodyFields['uri']));
} finally {
 client.close();
}
```

Furthermore you can track HTTP requests that you consider bad. In the
following example, exceptions are captured for each request
with a status code within the range of 400 to 404, and also for 500.

```dart
import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';

var client = SentryHttpClient(
  failedRequestStatusCodes: [
    SentryStatusCode.range(400, 404),
    SentryStatusCode(500),
  ],
);

try {
var uriResponse = await client.post('https://example.com/whatsit/create',
     body: {'name': 'doodle', 'color': 'blue'});
 print(await client.get(uriResponse.bodyFields['uri']));
} finally {
 client.close();
}
```

## Performance Monitoring for HTTP Requests

The `SentryHttpClient` starts a span out of the active span bound to the scope for each HTTP Request.
This is currently an opt-in feature. The following example shows how to enable it.

```dart
import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';

final transaction = Sentry.startTransaction(
  'webrequest',
  'request',
  bindToScope: true,
);

var client = SentryHttpClient(networkTracing: true);
try {
var uriResponse = await client.post('https://example.com/whatsit/create',
     body: {'name': 'doodle', 'color': 'blue'});
 print(await client.get(uriResponse.bodyFields['uri']));
} finally {
 client.close();
}

await transaction.finish(status: SpanStatus.ok());
```
