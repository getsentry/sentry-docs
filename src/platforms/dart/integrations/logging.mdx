The `sentry_logging` library provides [Logging](https://pub.dev/packages/logging) support for Sentry using the [onRecord property](https://pub.dev/documentation/logging/latest/logging/Logger/onRecord.html). It is able to collect breadcrumbs and capture events. Once this integration is configured, you can use Loggingâ€™s public API exclusively or in combination to the Sentry's SDK API to capture and enrich events.

The source can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dart/tree/main/logging/).

## Install

To add the Logging integration, add the `sentry_logging` dependency.

```yml {filename:pubspec.yaml}
dependencies:
  sentry: ^{{@inject packages.version('sentry.dart', '6.3.0') }}
  sentry_logging: ^{{@inject packages.version('sentry.dart.logging', '6.3.0') }}
  logging: ^1.0.2
```

## Configure

Configuration should happen as early as possible in your application's lifecycle.

<SignInNote />

```dart
import 'package:sentry_logging/sentry_logging.dart';
import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  await Sentry.init(
    (options) {
      options.dsn = '___PUBLIC_DSN___';
      options.addIntegration(LoggingIntegration());
    },
    appRunner: initApp, // Init your App.
  );
}
```

## Verify

This snippet captures an intentional error, so you can test that everything is working as soon as you set it up:

```dart
import 'package:logging/logging.dart';

void main() async {
  final log = Logger('MyAwesomeLogger');

  log.info('a breadcrumb!');

  try {
    throw Exception();
  } catch (error, stackTrace) {
    log.severe('an error!', error, stackTrace);
  }
}
```

<Note>

Learn more about manually capturing an error or message, in our <PlatformLink to="/usage/">Usage documentation</PlatformLink>.

</Note>

To view and resolve the recorded message, log into [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and open your project. Clicking on the error's title will open a page where you can see detailed information and mark it as resolved.
