The `sentry_dio` library provides [Dio](https://pub.dev/packages/dio) support for Sentry using the [HttpClientAdapter](https://pub.dev/documentation/dio/latest/dio/HttpClientAdapter-class.html). It is able to collect breadcrumbs, run performance monitoring for HTTP requests, and capture events for failed requests.

The source can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dart/tree/main/dio/).

## Install

To add the Dio integration, add the `sentry_dio` dependency.

```yml {filename:pubspec.yaml}
dependencies:
  sentry: ^{{@inject packages.version('sentry.dart', '6.4.0') }}
  sentry_dio: ^{{@inject packages.version('sentry.dart.dio', '6.4.0') }}
  dio: ^4.0.0
```

## Configure

Configuration should happen as early as possible in your application's lifecycle.

<SignInNote />

```dart
import 'package:sentry_dio/sentry_dio.dart';
import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  await Sentry.init(
    (options) {
      options.dsn = '___PUBLIC_DSN___';
    },
    appRunner: initApp, // Init your App.
  );
}

final dio = Dio();

// This *must* be the last initialization step of the Dio setup.
dio.addSentry(...);
```

## Reporting Bad HTTP Requests as Errors

The `Interceptors` can also catch exceptions that may occur during requests â€” for example [DioError](https://pub.dev/documentation/dio/latest/dio/DioError-class.html).

```dart
import 'package:sentry_dio/sentry_dio.dart';

final dio = Dio();

dio.addSentry();

final response = await dio.get<String>('https://wrong-url.dev/');
```

This is an opt-out feature. The following example shows how to disable it:

<SignInNote />

```dart
import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  await Sentry.init(
    (options) {
      options.dsn = '___PUBLIC_DSN___';
      options.captureFailedRequests = false;
    },
    appRunner: initApp, // Init your App.
  );
}
```

## Performance Monitoring for HTTP Requests

<Note>

Capturing transactions requires that you first <PlatformLink to="/performance/">set up performance monitoring</PlatformLink> if you haven't already.

</Note>

The Dio integration starts a span out of the active span bound to the scope for each HTTP request.

```dart
import 'package:sentry_dio/sentry_dio.dart';

final dio = Dio();

dio.addSentry();
```
