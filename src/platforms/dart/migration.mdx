## Migrating from `sentry` `5.1.x` to `sentry` `6.0.0`

* `Sentry.currentHub` is removed. Please use the static methods on `Sentry`
* `SentryOptions.cacheDirSize` was renamed to `SentryOptions.maxCacheItems`
* `EventProcessor` was changed from a callback to an interface

### Sentry Self Hosted Compatibility

* Since version `6.0.0` of the `sentry`, [Sentry's version >= v20.6.0](https://github.com/getsentry/onpremise/releases) is required. This only applies to on-premise Sentry, if you are using sentry.io no action is needed.

## Migrating from `sentry` `4.0.x` to `sentry` `5.0.0`

* Sentry's Dart SDK version 5.0.0 and above requires Dart 1.12.0
* Fix: Prefix classes with Sentry
  * A couple of classes were often conflicting with user's code.
    As a result, this change renames the following classes:
    * `App` -> `SentryApp`
    * `Browser` -> `SentryBrowser`
    * `Device` -> `SentryDevice`
    * `Gpu` -> `SentryGpu`
    * `Integration` -> `SentryIntegration`
    * `Message` -> `SentryMessage`
    * `OperatingSystem` -> `SentryOperatingSystem`
    * `Orientation` -> `SentryOrientation`
    * `Request` -> `SentryRequest`
    * `User` -> `SentryUser`
* Return type of `Sentry.close()` changed from `void` to `Future<void>` and `Integration.close()` changed from `void` to `FutureOr<void>`
