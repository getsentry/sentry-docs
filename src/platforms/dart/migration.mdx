## Migrating From `sentry` `6.18.x` to `sentry` `7.0.0`

API changes:

- Sentry's Dart SDK version 7.0.0 and above requires Dart `2.17.0`.
- Sentry's `sentry_file` package version 7.0.0 and above requires Dart `2.19.0`.
- Methods that used to take a `dynamic hint` optional parameter now take `Hint? hint` instead.
- The following deprecated fields have been removed from the `SentryDevice` class and replaced:
  - `screenResolution` replaced with `screenHeightPixels` and `screenWidthPixels`.
  - `timezone` replaced with `SentryCulture#timezone`.
  - `language` replaced with `SentryCulture#locale`.
  - `theme` replaced with `SentryOperatingSystem#theme`.
- The following deprecated field has been removed from the `Contexts#dart_context` databag and replaced:
  - `isolate` replaced with `SentryThread#name`.
- The following fields have been removed from the `Scope` class and replaced:
  - `user(SentryUser? user)` replaced with `setUser(SentryUser? user)`.
  - `attachements` replaced with `attachments`.
- Classes or methods that used to take the below optional parameters, have been moved to the `SentryOptions` class and replaced:
  - `captureFailedRequests` replaced with `SentryOptions#captureFailedRequests`.
  - `sendDefaultPii` replaced with `SentryOptions#sendDefaultPii`.
  - `maxRequestBodySize` replaced with `SentryOptions#maxRequestBodySize`.
  - `networkTracing` replaced with `SentryOptions#tracesSampleRate` or `SentryOptions#tracesSampler`.
  - `recordBreadcrumbs` replaced with `SentryOptions#recordHttpBreadcrumbs`.
- The following `SentryMeasurementUnits` are now strongly typed:
  - `DurationSentryMeasurementUnit`
  - `InformationSentryMeasurementUnit`
  - `FractionSentryMeasurementUnit`
  - `CustomSentryMeasurementUnit`
  - `NoneSentryMeasurementUnit`

Behavior changes:

- Sentry's Dart SDK version 7.0.0 and above supports Dart `3.0.0`.
- When an unhandled error happens and there's a running transaction, the transaction status will be set to `internal_error`.
- The `captureFailedRequests` feature is now enabled by default.
- The `enableStructuredDataTracing` feature is now enabled by default.
- The `enableUserInteractionTracing` feature is now enabled by default.

## Migrating From `sentry` `6.5.x` to `sentry` `6.6.x`

- `SentryOptions#sendClientReports` is now enabled by default. To disable it, use the code snippet below:

```dart
import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  await Sentry.init((options) => options.sendClientReports = false;
}
```

- The `Scope.user` setter was deprecated in favor of `Scope.setUser`, and it will be removed in a future update.

- The `Scope.attachements` getter was deprecated in favor of `attachments`, and it will be removed in a future update.

- The following `Scope` methods now return `Future<void>` instead of `void`:
  - `setContexts`
  - `removeContexts`
  - `setUser`
  - `addBreadcrumb`
  - `clearBreadcrumbs`
  - `setExtra`
  - `removeExtra`
  - `setTag`
  - `removeTag`

### Sentry Self-hosted Compatibility

- Starting with version `6.6.0` of `sentry`, [Sentry's version >= v21.9.0](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/releases) is required or you have to manually disable sending client reports via the `sendClientReports` option. This only applies to self-hosted Sentry. If you are using [sentry.io](https://sentry.io), no action is needed.

## Migrating From `sentry` `5.1.x` to `sentry` `6.0.0`

- `Sentry.currentHub` was removed. Please use the static methods on `Sentry`
- `SentryOptions.cacheDirSize` was renamed to `SentryOptions.maxCacheItems`
- `EventProcessor` was changed from a callback to an interface
- The data type from the following options was changed from `int` to `Duration`. The old options are still present but deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
  - `SentryOptions.autoSessionTrackingIntervalMillis` to `SentryOptions.autoSessionTrackingInterval`
  - `SentryOptions.anrTimeoutIntervalMillis` to `SentryOptions.anrTimeoutInterval`
- The `beforeSend` callback now accepts async code. The method signature changed from `SentryEvent? Function(SentryEvent event, {dynamic hint});` to `FutureOr<SentryEvent?> Function(SentryEvent event, {dynamic hint});`. While this is technically a breaking change, your code probably is still valid.
- Sentry accepts multiple exceptions and multiple threads. If you haven't set exceptions, there's no need to do anything.

### Sentry Self-hosted Compatibility

- Starting with version `6.0.0` of the `sentry`, [Sentry's version >= v20.6.0](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/releases) is required. This only applies to self-hosted Sentry. If you are using [sentry.io](https://sentry.io), no action is needed.

## Migrating From `sentry` `4.0.x` to `sentry` `5.0.0`

- Sentry's Dart SDK version 5.0.0 and above requires Dart 1.12.0
- Fix: Prefix classes with Sentry
  - A couple of classes were often conflicting with user's code.
    As a result, this change renames the following classes:
    - `App` -> `SentryApp`
    - `Browser` -> `SentryBrowser`
    - `Device` -> `SentryDevice`
    - `Gpu` -> `SentryGpu`
    - `Integration` -> `SentryIntegration`
    - `Message` -> `SentryMessage`
    - `OperatingSystem` -> `SentryOperatingSystem`
    - `Orientation` -> `SentryOrientation`
    - `Request` -> `SentryRequest`
    - `User` -> `SentryUser`
- Return type of `Sentry.close()` changed from `void` to `Future<void>` and `Integration.close()` changed from `void` to `FutureOr<void>`
