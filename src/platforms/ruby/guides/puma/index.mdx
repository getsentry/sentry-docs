lowlevel_error_handler do |ex, env|
  Raven.capture_exception(
    ex,
    :message => ex.message,
    :extra => { :puma => env },
    :transaction => "Puma"
  )
  # note the below is just a Rack response
  [500, {}, ["An error has occurred, and engineers have been informed. Please reload the page. If you continue to have problems, contact support@example.com\n"]]
end
```
