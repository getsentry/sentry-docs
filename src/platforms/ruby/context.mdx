Additional context can be passed to the capture methods. This allows you to record extra information that could help you identify the root cause of the issue or who the error happened for.

```ruby
Raven.capture_message 'My Event!',
  logger: 'logger',
  extra: {
    my_custom_variable: 'value'
  },
  tags: {
    foo: 'bar'
  }
```

The following attributes are available:

- `logger`: the logger name to record this event under
- `level`: a string representing the level of this event (fatal, error, warning, info, debug)
- `server_name`: the hostname of the server
- `tags`: a mapping of tags describing this event
- `extra`: a mapping of arbitrary context
- `user`: a mapping of user context
- `transaction`: An array of strings. The final element in the array represents the current transaction, e.g. “HelloController#hello_world” for a Rails controller.

## Providing Request Context

Most of the time you’re not actually calling out to Raven directly, but you still want to provide some additional context. This lifecycle generally constists of something like the following:

- Set some context via a middleware (e.g. the logged in user)
- Send all given context with any events during the request lifecycle
- Cleanup context

There are three primary methods for providing request context.

### User Context

User context describes the current actor.

```ruby
# bind the logged in user
Raven.user_context(
  # a unique ID which represents this user
  id: current_user.id, # 1

  # the actor's email address, if available
  email: current_user.email, # "example@example.org"

  # the actor's username, if available
  username: current_user.username, # "foo"

  # the actor's IP address, if available
  ip_address: request.ip # '127.0.0.1'
)
```

When dealing with anonymous users you will still want to send basic user context to ensure Sentry can count them against the unique users:

```ruby
Raven.user_context(
  # the actor's IP address, if available
  ip_address: request.ip # '127.0.0.1'
)
```

### Tags

You can provide a set of key/value pairs called tags which Sentry will index and aggregate. This will help you understand the distribution of issues, as well as enabling easy lookup via search.

```ruby
# tag the request with something interesting
Raven.tags_context(
  language: I18n.locale, # "en-us"
  timezone: current_user.time_zone # "PST"
)

# define a scope with block
Raven.tags_context(my_tag: 'my value') do
  # will be tagged with my_tag="my value"
  Raven.capture_exception(exception)
end

# will not be tagged with my_tag
Raven.capture_exception(exception)
```

### Additional Context

In addition to the supported structured data of Sentry, you can provide additional context. This is a key/value mapping, where the values must be JSON compatible, but can be of a rich datatype.

```ruby
# provide a bit of additional context
Raven.extra_context(
  happiness: 'very',
  emoji: ['much']
)

# define a scope with block
Raven.extra_context(my_context: 'my value') do
  # will be captured with my_context="my_value"
  Raven.capture_exception(exception)
end

# will not be captured with my_context
Raven.capture_exception(exception)
```

### Rack (HTTP) Context

Additionally, if you’re using Rack (without the middleware), you can easily provide context with the `rack_context` helper:

```ruby
Raven.rack_context(env)
```

If you’re using the Rack middleware, we’ve already taken care of cleanup for you, otherwise you’ll need to ensure you perform it manually:

```ruby
Raven::Context.clear!
```

The rack and user context will perform a set operation, whereas tags and extra context will merge with any existing request context.

### Transactions

The “transaction” is intended to represent the action the event occurred during. In Rack, this will be the request URL. In Rails, it’s the controller name and action (“HelloController#hello_world”).

Transactions are modeled as a stack. The top item in the stack (i.e. the last element of the array) will be used as the `transaction` for any events:

```ruby
Raven.context.transaction.push "User Import"
# import some users
Raven.context.transaction.pop
```

Transactions may also be overridden/set explicitly during event creation:

```ruby
Raven.capture_exception(exception, transaction: "User Import")
```
