Breadcrumbs are a trail of events which happened prior to an issue. Often, these events are very similar to traditional logs, but Breadcrumbs also can record rich, structured data.

```ruby
Raven.breadcrumbs.record do |crumb|
  crumb.data = data
  crumb.category = name
  # ...
end
```

The following attributes are available:

- `category`: A String to label the event under. This will usually be the same as a logger name, and will let you more easily understand the area an event took place, such as “auth”.
- `data`: A Hash of metadata around the event. This is often used instead of message, but may also be used in addition.
- `level`: The level may be any of `error`, `warn`, `info`, or `debug`.
- `message`: A string describing the event. The most common vector, often used as a drop-in for a traditional log message.
- `timestamp`: A Unix timestamp (seconds past epoch)

Appropriate places to inject Breadcrumbs may be places like your HTTP library:

```ruby
# Instrumenting Faraday with a middleware:

class RavenFaradayMiddleware
  def call
    # Add a breadcrumb every time we complete an HTTP request
    @app.call(request_env).on_complete do |response_env|
      Raven.breadcrumbs.record do |crumb|
        crumb.data = { response_env: response_env }
        crumb.category = "faraday"
        crumb.timestamp = Time.now.to_i
        crumb.message = "Completed request to #{request_env[:url]}"
      end
    end
  end
end
```

_(New in version 2.6.)_

The breadcrumb buffer is publicly accessible if you wish to manipulate it beyond what is possible with the `record` method.

```ruby
Raven.breadcrumbs.buffer # Array of breadcrumbs
```
