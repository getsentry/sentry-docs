Raven Ruby comes as a gem and is straightforward to install. If you are using Bundler just add this to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "sentry-raven"
```

## Development Version

If you want to install the development version from GitHub:

```ruby
gem "sentry-raven", :github => "getsentry/raven-ruby"
```

## Without Integrations

If you wish to activate integrations manually (or don’t want them activated by default), require “raven/base” instead of “raven” or “sentry-raven”. In that case disable the requiring in the `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "sentry-raven", :require => false
```

And in your initialization code:

```ruby
require "raven/base"
require "raven/integrations/rails"
require "raven/integrations/delayed_job"
```

This stops you from calling `Raven.inject`, which is where all this integration loading occurs.
