To use Raven Ruby all you need is your DSN. Like most Sentry libraries it will honor the `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable. You can find it on the project settings page under API Keys. You can either export it as environment variable or manually configure it with `Raven.configure`:

```ruby
Raven.configure do |config|
  config.dsn = '___PUBLIC_DSN___'
end
```

If you only want to send events to Sentry in certain environments, you should set `config.environments` too:

```ruby
Raven.configure do |config|
  config.dsn = '___PUBLIC_DSN___'
  config.environments = ['staging', 'production']
end
```

## Reporting Failures

If you use Rails, Rake, Rack etc, you’re already done - no more configuration required! Check [_Integrations_](../integrations/) for more details on other gems Sentry integrates with automatically.

Otherwise, Raven supports two methods of capturing exceptions:

```ruby
Raven.capture do
  # capture any exceptions which happen during execution of this block
  1 / 0
end

begin
  1 / 0
rescue ZeroDivisionError => exception
  Raven.capture_exception(exception)
end
```

## Reporting Messages

If you want to report a message rather than an exception you can use the `capture_message` method:

```ruby
Raven.capture_message("Something went very wrong")
```

## Referencing Events

The client exposes a `last_event_id` accessor allowing you to easily reference the last captured event. This is useful, for example, if you wanted to show the user a reference on your error page:

```ruby
# somewhere deep in the stack
Raven.capture do
  1 / 0
end
```

Now you can easily expose this to your error handler:

```ruby
class ErrorsController < ApplicationController
  def internal_server_error
    render(:status => 500, :sentry_event_id => Raven.last_event_id)
  end
end
```

## Optional Attributes

With calls to `capture_exception` or `capture_message` additional data can be supplied:

> ```ruby
> Raven.capture_message("...", :attr => 'value')
> ```

`extra`

: Additional context for this event. Must be a mapping. Children can be any native JSON type.

```ruby
{
    :extra => {'key' => 'value'}
}
```

`fingerprint`

: The fingerprint for grouping this event.

```ruby
{
    :fingerprint => ['{{ default }}', 'other value']
}
```

`level`

: The level of the event. Defaults to `error`.

```ruby
{
    :level => 'warning'
}
```

Sentry is aware of the following levels:

- debug (the least serious)
- info
- warning
- error
- fatal (the most serious)

`logger`

: The logger name for the event.

```ruby
{
    :logger => 'default'
}
```

`tags`

: Tags to index with this event. Must be a mapping of strings.

```ruby
{
    :tags => {'key' => 'value'}
}
```

`user`

: The acting user.

```ruby
{
    :user => {
        'id' => 42,
        'email' => 'clever-girl'
    }
}
```

## Many Instances

It is possible to have many different instances and configurations of the Raven client running at once. See the delegation pattern in `base.rb` for more information about how the `Raven` module delegates calls to the “main” instance.

```ruby
Raven.capture # capture, sent to the main instance

# You can create as many instances as you like. Provide a context and config.
instance = Raven::Instance.new(Raven::Context.new, Raven::Configuration.new)
```

Currently, all integrations use the “main” instance.
