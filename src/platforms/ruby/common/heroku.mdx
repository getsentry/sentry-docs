Once you've configured Sentry via the appropriate framework you're using, you may also want to enable some Heroku specific features.

## Automated Releases

Enable the `runtime-dyno-metadata` Heroku Labs feature in order to enable automated release detection:

```bash
heroku labs:enable runtime-dyno-metadata -a myapp
```
