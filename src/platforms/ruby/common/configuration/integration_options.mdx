## sentry-rails

`rails.report_rescued_exceptions`

: Rails catches exceptions in the `ActionDispatch::ShowExceptions` or `ActionDispatch::DebugExceptions` middlewares, depending on the environment. By default, Sentry will report exceptions even when they are rescued by these middlewares.

You can disable this by setting it to `false`:

```ruby
config.rails.report_rescued_exceptions
```

`rails.skippable_job_adapters`

: If you don't want to report events from a certain ActiveJob adapter, or you already have a better setup for it, you can use this option to skip ActiveJob reporting on that adapter.

```ruby
config.rails.skippable_job_adapters = ["ActiveJob::QueueAdapters::MyAdapter"]
```
