## sentry-rails

`rails.report_rescued_exceptions`

: Rails catches exceptions in the `ActionDispatch::ShowExceptions` or `ActionDispatch::DebugExceptions` middlewares, depending on the environment. By default, Sentry will report exceptions even when they are rescued by these middlewares.

You can disable this by setting it to `false`:

```ruby
config.rails.report_rescued_exceptions
```
