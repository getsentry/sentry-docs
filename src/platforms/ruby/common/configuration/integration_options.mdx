## sentry-rails

`rails.report_rescued_exceptions`

: Rails catches exceptions in the `ActionDispatch::ShowExceptions` or `ActionDispatch::DebugExceptions` middlewares, depending on the environment. By default, Sentry will report exceptions even when they are rescued by these middlewares.

You can disable this by setting it to `false`:

```ruby
config.rails.report_rescued_exceptions
```

`rails.skippable_job_adapters`

: If you don't want to report events from a certain ActiveJob adapter, or you already have a better setup for it, you can use this option to skip ActiveJob reporting on that adapter.

```ruby
config.rails.skippable_job_adapters = ["ActiveJob::QueueAdapters::MyAdapter"]
```

`rails.tracing_subscribers`

: Tracing subscribers are responsible for capturing tracing spans from Rails instrumentation. The default subscribers are:

- `Sentry::Rails::Tracing::ActionControllerSubscriber`
- `Sentry::Rails::Tracing::ActionViewSubscriber`
- `Sentry::Rails::Tracing::ActiveRecordSubscriber`
- `Sentry::Rails::Tracing::ActiveStorageSubscriber`

```ruby
# you can add a new subscriber
config.rails.tracing_subscribers << MySubscriber
# or replace the set completely
config.rails.tracing_subscribers = [MySubscriber]
```

## sentry-delayed_job

`delayed_job.report_after_job_retries`

: `sentry-delayed_job` captures exceptions whenever they occur in a job execution. You can make it wait until the retry is exhausted. Default is `false`.

```
config.delayed_job.report_after_job_retries = true
```

## sentry-sidekiq

`sidekiq.report_after_job_retries`

: `sentry-sidekiq` captures exceptions whenever they occur in a job execution. You can make it wait until the retry is exhausted. Default is `false`.

```
config.sidekiq.report_after_job_retries = true
```
