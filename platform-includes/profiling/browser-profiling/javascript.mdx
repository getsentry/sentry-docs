<Alert>

Browser Profiling is currently in beta. Beta features are still in progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.

</Alert>

[Profiling](/product/explore/profiling/) captures function-level data from your production code to enable you to fine-tune your app's performance. It tracks what's being called, how often, and where. In the browser, this helps you pinpoint causes of UI jank, understand why metrics like [Interaction to Next Paint (INP)](/product/insights/web-vitals/web-vitals-concepts/#interaction-to-next-paint-inp) are slow, or identify long tasks blocking repaints and causing frame drops.

<Alert level="info" title="Chromium Only">

Browser Profiling uses the [JS Self-Profiling API](https://wicg.github.io/js-self-profiling/), currently only available in Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge). Profiles will only include data from these browsers.

## Quick Setup

<PlatformSection notSupported={["javascript.electron"]}>

**Requirements**: <PlatformSdkPackageName fallback="@sentry/browser"/> SDK version `10.27.0`+ (or `7.60.0`+ for deprecated transaction-based profiling)

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["javascript.electron"]}>

**Requirements**: <PlatformSdkPackageName fallback="@sentry/electron"/> SDK version `7.4.0`+ (or `4.16.0`+ for deprecated transaction-based profiling)

</PlatformSection>

### 1. Install the SDK

<PlatformContent includePath="profiling/automatic-instrumentation-intro" />

### 2. Add the Document-Policy Header

Your server must return `Document-Policy: js-profiling` in response headers.

<PlatformContent includePath="profiling/automatic-instrumentation-headers" />

### 3. Configure the SDK

<PlatformContent includePath="profiling/automatic-instrumentation-setup" />

## Profiling Modes

| Mode | Description | Use When |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Manual** (default) | You control when profiling runs | Profiling specific user flows or interactions |
| **Trace** | Profiler runs automatically with active spans | You want profiles attached to all traced operations |

### Manual Mode

Start and stop the profiler around code you want to profile:

```javascript
Sentry.uiProfiler.startProfiler();
// Code here will be profiled
Sentry.uiProfiler.stopProfiler();
```

### Trace Mode

Profiles automatically attach to spans. Enable by setting `profileLifecycle: "trace"`:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    Sentry.browserTracingIntegration(),
    Sentry.browserProfilingIntegration(),
  ],
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  profileSessionSampleRate: 1.0,
  profileLifecycle: "trace",
});
```

## Sentry vs Chrome DevTools

| | Sentry Profiling | Chrome DevTools |
|---|---|---|
| **Environment** | Production (real users) | Local development |
| **Sampling rate** | 100Hz (10ms period) | 1000Hz (1ms period) |
| **Source maps** | Deobfuscated function names | Minified names |
| **Data scope** | Aggregated across users | Single session |

<Expandable title="Troubleshooting">

**Chrome DevTools shows "Profiling Overhead"**

When `browserProfilingIntegration` is enabled, Chrome DevTools incorrectly attributes rendering work as profiling overhead. Disable the integration when using DevTools locally.

**Profiles only from Chrome users**

This is expected. The JS Self-Profiling API is currently only implemented in Chromium browsers. Consider this bias when analyzing data.
