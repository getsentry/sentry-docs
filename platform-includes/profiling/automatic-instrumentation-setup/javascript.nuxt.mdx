```javascript {filename:sentry.client.config.js|ts}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nuxt";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    // Add browser profiling integration to the list of integrations
    Sentry.browserProfilingIntegration(),
  ],

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for tracing.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  // Set `tracePropagationTargets` to control for which URLs trace propagation should be enabled
  tracePropagationTargets: ["localhost", /^https:\/\/yourserver\.io\/api/],

  // Set profilesSampleRate to 1.0 to profile every transaction.
  // Since profilesSampleRate is relative to tracesSampleRate,
  // the final profiling rate can be computed as tracesSampleRate * profilesSampleRate
  // For example, a tracesSampleRate of 0.5 and profilesSampleRate of 0.5 would
  // result in 25% of transactions being profiled (0.5*0.5=0.25)
  profilesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

Alternatively, instead of a `profilesSampleRate` your can also provide a `profilesSampler` function:

```javascript {filename:sentry.client.config.js|ts}
const Sentry = require("@sentry/nuxt");

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    // Add browser profiling integration to the list of integrations
    Sentry.browserTracingIntegration(),
    Sentry.browserProfilingIntegration(),
  ],
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,

  // This function will be called for every sampled span
  // to determine if it should be profiled
  profilesSampler: (samplingContext) => {
    return 1.0;
  },
});
```
