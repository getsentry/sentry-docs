With [profiling](/product/explore/profiling/), Sentry tracks your software's performance by sampling your program's call stack in a variety of environments. This feature collects function-level information about your code and enables you to fine-tune your program's performance. Sentry's profiler captures function calls and their exact locations, aggregates them, and shows you the most common code paths of your program. This highlights areas you could optimize to help increase both the performance of your code and user satisfaction.

In a browser environment, profiling can help you pinpoint causes of UI jank, surface why values like interaction to next paint (INP) are performing poorly, or why a long task was keeping the browser from repainting the screen and causing frame drops. All of this information enables you to fix real world performance issues and deliver a snappier user experience to your users.
