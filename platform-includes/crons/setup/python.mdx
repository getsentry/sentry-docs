## Automatic Crons Instrumentation

If you're using **Celery Beat** to run your periodic tasks, have a look at our [Celery Beat Auto Discovery documentation](/platforms/python/integrations/celery/crons/).

## Job Monitoring

Use the Python SDK to monitor and notify you if your periodic task is missed (or doesn't start when expected), if it fails due to a problem in the runtime (such as an error), or if it fails by exceeding its maximum runtime.

Use the `monitor` decorator to wrap your tasks:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.crons import monitor

# Add the @monitor decorator to your task
@monitor(monitor_slug='<monitor-slug>')
def tell_the_world():
    print('My scheduled task...')
```

Alternatively, `monitor` can be used as a context manager:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.crons import monitor

def tell_the_world():
    with monitor(monitor_slug='<monitor-slug>'):
        print('My scheduled task...')
```

<Note>

Since version `1.44.1` of the SDK you can use `monitor` to annotate asynchronous
functions as well.
