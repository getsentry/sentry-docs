## Job Monitoring

If you're using `sidekiq-cron` or `sidekiq-scheduler`, Sentry can automatically
capture check-ins for all jobs that are scheduled to run periodically. To
achieve this, you need to enable the corresponding Sentry plugin:

```rb
Sentry.init do |config|
  config.enabled_patches += [:sidekiq_cron]
  # or, for sidekiq-scheduler:
  config.enabled_patches += [:sidekiq_scheduler]
end
```

More generally, popular job frameworks such as `ActiveJob` and `Sidekiq` with
a `perform` method can use the `Sentry::Cron::MonitorCheckIns` mixin module
to automatically capture check-ins.

```rb {tabTitle: ActiveJob}
class ExampleJob < ApplicationJob
  include Sentry::Cron::MonitorCheckIns

  sentry_monitor_check_ins

  def perform(*args)
    # do stuff
  end
end
```

```rb {tabTitle: Sidekiq}
class SidekiqJob
  include Sidekiq::Job
  include Sentry::Cron::MonitorCheckIns

  sentry_monitor_check_ins

  def perform(*args)
    # do stuff
  end
end
```

You can pass in optional attributes to `sentry_monitor_check_ins` as follows.

```rb
# slug defaults to the job class name
sentry_monitor_check_ins slug: 'custom_slug'

# define the monitor config with an interval
# the units supported are :year, :month, :week, :day, :hour, :minute
sentry_monitor_check_ins monitor_config: Sentry::Cron::MonitorConfig.from_interval(1, :minute)

# define the monitor config with a crontab
sentry_monitor_check_ins monitor_config: Sentry::Cron::MonitorConfig.from_crontab('5 * * * *')
```

## Manual Setup

If you're using `Clockwork` or `Whenever`, you'll need to instrument your jobs
manually.

### Check-Ins (Recommended)

Check-in monitoring allows you to track a job's progress by completing two check-ins: one at the start of your job and another at the end of your job. This two-step process allows Sentry to notify you if your job didn't start when expected (missed) or if it exceeded its maximum runtime (failed).

```ruby
check_in_id = Sentry.capture_check_in('<monitor-slug>', :in_progress)
# Execute your scheduled task here...
Sentry.capture_check_in('<monitor-slug>', :ok, check_in_id: check_in_id)
```

If your job execution fails, you can notify Sentry about the failure:

```ruby
Sentry.capture_check_in('<monitor-slug>', :error, check_in_id: check_in_id)
```

### Heartbeat

Heartbeat monitoring notifies Sentry of a job's status through one check-in. This setup will only notify you if your job didn't start when expected (missed). If you need to track a job to see if it exceeded its maximum runtime (failed), use check-ins instead.

```ruby
Sentry.capture_check_in('<monitor-slug>', :ok)
```

If your job execution fails, you can notify Sentry about the failure:

```ruby
Sentry.capture_check_in('<monitor-slug>', :error)
```

## Upserting Cron Monitors

You can create and update your Monitors programmatically with code
rather than [creating and configuring them in Sentry.io](https://sentry.io/crons/create/).

First create a config object from either a crontab or an interval.

```ruby
# Create a config from a crontab schedule (every 10 minutes)
monitor_config = Sentry::Cron::MonitorConfig.from_crontab(
  '5 * * * *',
  checkin_margin: 5, # Optional check-in margin in minutes
  max_runtime: 15, # Optional max runtime in minutes
  timezone: 'Europe/Vienna', # Optional timezone
)

# Create a config from an interval schedule (every 10 minutes)
monitor_config = Sentry::Cron::MonitorConfig.from_interval(
  10,
  :minute,
  checkin_margin: 5, # Optional check-in margin in minutes
  max_runtime: 15, # Optional max runtime in minutes
  timezone: 'Europe/Vienna', # Optional timezone
)
```

Then, use that config object during your check-ins.

```ruby
# 🟡 Notify Sentry your job is running:
check_in_id = Sentry.capture_check_in(
  '<monitor-slug>',
  :in_progress,
  monitor_config: monitor_config
)

# Execute your scheduled task here...

# 🟢 Notify Sentry your job has completed successfully:
Sentry.capture_check_in(
  '<monitor-slug>',
  :ok,
  check_in_id: check_in_id,
  monitor_config: monitor_config
)`
```
