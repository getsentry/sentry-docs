## Job Monitoring

If you're using [Oban](https://github.com/sorentwo/oban) or [Quantum](https://github.com/quantum-elixir/quantum-core), Sentry can automatically capture check-ins for all jobs that are scheduled to run periodically. To achieve this, you need to enable the corresponding Sentry plugin:

```elixir
config :sentry,
  integrations: [
    oban: [cron: [enabled: true]],
    # Or for Quantum:
    quantum: [cron: [enabled: true]],
  ]
```

## Manual Setup

If you're using another library or a custom solution for scheduling jobs, you'll need to instrument those jobs manually.

### Check-Ins (Recommended)

Check-in monitoring allows you to track a job's progress by completing **two check-ins**: one at the start of your job, and another at the end of your job. This two-step process allows Sentry to notify you if your job didn't start when expected (missed) or if it exceeded its maximum runtime (failed).

```elixir
{:ok, check_in_id} = Sentry.capture_check_in(status: :in_progress, monitor_slug: "<monitor-slug>")

# Execute your scheduled task here
my_scheduled_job()

Sentry.capture_check_in(check_in_id: check_in_id, status: :ok, monitor_slug: "<monitor-slug>")
```

If your job execution fails, you can notify Sentry about the failure:

```elixir
Sentry.capture_check_in(check_in_id: check_in_id, status: :error, monitor_slug: "<monitor-slug>")
```

### Heartbeats

Heartbeat monitoring notifies Sentry of a job's status through _a single check-in_. This setup will only notify you if your job didn't start when expected (missed). If you need to track a job to see if it exceeded its maximum runtime (failed), use check-ins instead.

```elixir
Sentry.capture_check_in(status: :ok, monitor_slug: "<monitor-slug>")
```

If your job execution fails, you can notify Sentry about the failure:

```elixir
Sentry.capture_check_in(status: :error, monitor_slug: "<monitor-slug>")
```

## Upserting Cron Monitors

You can create and update your monitors programmatically with code rather than [creating and configuring them in Sentry](https://sentry.io/crons/create/).

To do that, you need to pass a `:monitor_config` set of options to `Sentry.capture_check_in/3`:

```elixir
# Create a config from a crontab schedule (every 10 minutes)
monitor_config = [
  schedule: [
    type: :crontab,
    value: "5 * * * *",
  ],
  checkin_margin: 5, # Optional check-in margin in minutes
  max_runtime: 15, # Optional max runtime in minutes
  timezone: "Europe/Vienna", # Optional timezone
]

# Alternatively, create a config from an interval schedule (every 10 minutes in this case):
monitor_config = [
  schedule: [
    type: :interval,
    unit: :minute,
    value: 10
  ],
  checkin_margin: 5, # Optional check-in margin in minutes
  max_runtime: 15, # Optional max runtime in minutes
  timezone: "Europe/Vienna", # Optional timezone
]

# Notify Sentry your job is running:
{:ok, check_in_id} =
  Sentry.capture_check_in(
    status: :in_progress,
    monitor_slug: "<monitor-slug>",
    monitor_config: monitor_config
  )

# Execute your job:
execute_job()

# Notify Sentry your job has completed successfully:
Sentry.capture_check_in(
  status: :ok,
  check_in_id: check_in_id,
  monitor_slug: "<monitor-slug>",
  monitor_config: monitor_config
)
```
