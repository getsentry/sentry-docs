## Job Monitoring

Use the Laravel SDK to monitor and notify you if your [scheduled task](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/scheduling) is missed (or doesn't start when expected), if it fails due to a problem in the runtime (such as an error), or if it fails by exceeding its maximum runtime.

To set up, add the `sentryMonitor()` macro to the scheduled tasks defined in your `app/Console/Kernel.php` file as shown below. (Please note, this will create a Cron monitor that will count against your quota.)

```php {filename:app/Console/Kernel.php}
protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
{
    $schedule->command('emails:send')
        ->everyHour()
        ->sentryMonitor(); // add this line
}
```

Tasks that use Laravel's `between`, `unlessBetween`, `when` and `skip` methods are currently not supported.
For the best results, we recommend using Laravel's [`cron`](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/scheduling#schedule-frequency-options) method to define your schedule's frequency.

## Configure a Job Monitor

By default, the Laravel SDK will infer various parameters of your scheduled task.
For greater control, we expose some optional parameters on the `sentryMonitor()` macro.

```php {filename:app/Console/Kernel.php}
protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
{
    $schedule->command('emails:send')
        ->everyHour()
        ->sentryMonitor(
            // Specify the slug of the job monitor in case of duplicate commands or if the monitor was created in the UI
            monitorSlug: null,
            // Check-in margin in minutes
            checkInMargin: 5,
            // Max runtime in minutes
            maxRuntime: 15,
            // In case you want to configure the job monitor exclusively in the UI, you can turn off sending the monitor config with the check-in.
            // Passing a monitor-slug is required in this case.
            updateMonitorConfig: false,
        )
}
```
