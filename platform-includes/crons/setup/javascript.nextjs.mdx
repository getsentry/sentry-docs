Cron monitoring is only supported in Server and Edge runtimes for Next.js

## Automatic Check-Ins (Vercel Only)

If you are hosting your Next.js application on Vercel and you are using [Vercel's Cron Jobs feature](https://vercel.com/docs/cron-jobs), you can configure the Next.js SDK to automatically create Check-Ins for you.
Instrumented cron jobs are decided at runtime by examining the `crons` field in your `vercel.json` file.

Set the `automaticVercelMonitors` option to `true` in your Sentry settings in `next.config.js`. See <PlatformLink to="/manual-setup/#opt-out-of-auto-instrumentation-of-vercel-cron-jobs">Manual Setup</PlatformLink> for more details.

<Alert level="warning">
Automatic instrumentation of Vercel cron jobs currently only works for the Pages Router. App Router route handlers are not yet supported.
