## Automatic Check-Ins (Recommended)

_requires SDK version 7.88.0 or higher_

Use the `DenoCron` integration to monitor your [`Deno.cron`](https://deno.com/blog/cron) calls and get notified when a schedule job is missed (or doesn't start when expected), if it fails due to a problem in the runtime (such as an error), or if it fails by exceeding its maximum runtime.

```TypeScript
import * as Sentry from "https://deno.land/x/sentry/index.mjs";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [Sentry.denoCronIntegration()],
});
```
