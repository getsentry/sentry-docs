## Check-Ins (Recommended)

Check-in monitoring allows you to track a job's progress by completing two check-ins: one at the start of your job and another at the end of your job. This two-step process allows Sentry to notify you if your job didn't start when expected (missed) or if it exceeded its maximum runtime (failed).

```csharp
// ðŸŸ¡ Notify Sentry your job is running:
var checkInId = SentrySdk.CaptureCheckIn("<monitor-slug>", CheckInStatus.InProgress);

// Execute your scheduled task here...

// ðŸŸ¢ Notify Sentry your job has completed successfully:
SentrySdk.CaptureCheckIn("<monitor-slug>", CheckInStatus.Ok, checkInId);
```

If your job execution fails, you can notify Sentry about the failure:

```csharp
// ðŸ”´ Notify Sentry your job has failed:
SentrySdk.CaptureCheckIn("<monitor-slug>", CheckInStatus.Error, checkInId);
```
