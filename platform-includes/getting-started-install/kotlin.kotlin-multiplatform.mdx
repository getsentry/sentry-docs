To install the Kotlin Multiplatform SDK, you need to add the following to your `build.gradle.kts` file in your shared module:

```kotlin {filename:shared/build.gradle.kts}
plugins {
  id("io.sentry.kotlin.multiplatform.gradle") version "{{@inject packages.version('sentry.kotlin.kmp', '0.9.0') }}"
}
```

The plugin installs the Sentry KMP dependency. If you're using the Cocoapods plugin, it will also install the Sentry Cocoa dependency.
