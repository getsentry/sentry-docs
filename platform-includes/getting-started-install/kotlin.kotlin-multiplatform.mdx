To install the Kotlin Multiplatform SDK, you need to add the following to your `build.gradle.kts` file in your shared module:

```kotlin {filename:shared/build.gradle.kts}
plugins {
  id("io.sentry.kotlin.multiplatform.gradle") version "{{@inject packages.version('sentry.kotlin.kmp.gradle-plugin', '0.9.0') }}"
}
```

The plugin does the following:

- Automatically installs the Sentry KMP dependency to `commonMain`. 
- If you use the Kotlin Cocoapods plugin, it installs the Sentry Cocoa dependency.
- If you use Swift Package Manager, it sets up linking to the Sentry Cocoa framework.


<Alert>

If you use Swift Package Manager instead of Cocoapods, you need to install the [sentry-cocoa dependency with Swift Package Manager](/platforms/apple/install/swift-package-manager/) in your Xcode project first before executing the Gradle plugin.
