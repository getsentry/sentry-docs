To install the Kotlin Multiplatform SDK in your Compose Multiplatform project, you need to add the following to your `build.gradle.kts` file in your shared module:

```kotlin {filename:composeApp/build.gradle.kts}
plugins {
  id("io.sentry.kotlin.multiplatform.gradle") version "{{@inject packages.version('sentry.kotlin.kmp.gradle-plugin', '0.9.0') }}"
}
```

The plugin does the following:

- Automatically installs the Sentry KMP dependency to `commonMain`. 
- If you use the Kotlin Cocoapods plugin, it installs the Sentry Cocoa dependency.
- If you use Swift Package Manager, it sets up linking to the Sentry Cocoa framework.

<Alert>

If you use Swift Package Manager instead of Cocoapods, you need to install the [Sentry Cocoa dependency with Swift Package Manager](/platforms/apple/install/swift-package-manager/) in your Xcode project first before executing the Gradle plugin.

Make sure that you install the Sentry Cocoa SDK version compatible with the corresponding Sentry Kotlin Multiplatform SDK version. You can find the compatible versions in the [Sentry Kotlin Multiplatform SDK README](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-kotlin-multiplatform?tab=readme-ov-file#cocoa-sdk-version-compatibility-table).
