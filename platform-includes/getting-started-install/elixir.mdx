Edit your `mix.exs` file to add it as a dependency and add the `:sentry` package to your application:

```elixir {filename:mix.exs}
defp deps do
  [
    # ...
    {:sentry, "~> {{@inject packages.version('sentry.elixir') }}"},
    {:jason, "~> 1.1"},

    # If you want to use Sentry's default HTTP client:
    {:hackney, "~> 1.8"}
  ]
end
```
