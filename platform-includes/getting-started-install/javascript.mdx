We recommend installing Sentry via a package manager. If that isn't an option for you, you can use the [Loader Script](/platforms/javascript/install/loader/) or a CDN bundle.

#### Option 1: Package Manager (Recommended)

Run the command for your preferred package manager to add the Sentry SDK to your application:

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install @sentry/browser --save
```

```bash {tabTitle:yarn}
yarn add @sentry/browser
```

```bash {tabTitle:pnpm}
pnpm add @sentry/browser
```

#### Option 2: Loader Script

In Sentry, go to
**Settings > Projects > (select project) > SDK Setup > Loader Script**.
Enable the features you want (for example, Tracing or Session Replay), copy the script tag, and place it before all other scripts in your app.

#### Option 3: CDN Bundle

Sentry provides different bundles that include specific feature combinations. Go to our list of [available bundles](/platforms/javascript/install/loader/#cdn) and copy the one that fits your needs.
Next, place the script tag before all other scripts in your app.
