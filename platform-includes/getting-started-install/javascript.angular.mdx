### Angular Version Compatibility

In its current major version, the Sentry Angular SDK only supports Angular 14 and newer.

If you're using an older version of Angular, you also need to use an older version of the SDK. See the table below for compatibility guidance:

| Angular version | Recommended Sentry SDK                                                                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 14 and newer    | `@sentry/angular`                                                                                      |
| 12 or 13        | `@sentry/angular-ivy@^7` (see [Note](#what-is-sentryangular-ivy)) *                                    |
| 10 or 11        | `@sentry/angular@^7` *                                                                                 |
| 9 and below     | `@sentry/angular@^6` *                                                                                 |
| AngularJS/1.x   | `@sentry/browser@^6` with the [AngularJS integration](/platforms/javascript/guides/angular/angular1) * |

\* These versions of the SDK are no longer maintained or tested. Version 7 might still receive bug fixes but we don't guarantee support.

#### What is `@sentry/angular-ivy`?

The `@sentry/angular-ivy` package is an Ivy-compatible version of `@sentry/angular` in version 7 of the SDK. It's recommended to use this package if you're using Angular 12 or 13 to avoid build-time warnings.
Functionality-wise, it's identical to `@sentry/angular` and you can simply replace all imports of `@sentry/angular` with `@sentry/angular-ivy` in our docs.
Since version 8, the `@sentry/angular-ivy` was [removed and merged](./migration/v7-to-v8/#supported-versions) with `@sentry/angular` which is now Ivy-compatible by default.
