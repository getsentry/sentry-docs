### Angular Version Compatibility

The Sentry Angular SDK supports Angular 14 and newer in its current major version.

If you're using an older version of Angular, you also need to use an older version of the SDK:

| Angular version | Recommended Sentry SDK                                            |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 14 and newer    | `@sentry/angular`                                                 |
| 12 or 13        | `@sentry/angular-ivy@^7` (see [Note](#what-is-sentryangular-ivy)) |
| 10 or 11        | `@sentry/angular@^7`                                              |

<Alert level="warning">

Support for Angular versions below 14 was discontinued in version 8 of the SDK.
If you need to use Angular 13 or older, you can continue using version 7 of the SDK (see table above).
If you need to use Angular 9 or older, you can continue using version 6 of the SDK.
For AngularJS/1.x, use `@sentry/browser@^6` and our [AngularJS integration](/platforms/javascript/guides/angular/angular1).
Please note, that these versions of the SDK are no longer maintained or tested.

</Alert>

#### What is `@sentry/angular-ivy`?

The `@sentry/angular-ivy` package is an Ivy-compatible version of `@sentry/angular` in version 7 of the SDK. It's recommended to use this package if you're using Angular 12 or 13 to avoid build-time warnings.
Functionality-wise, it's identical to `@sentry/angular` and you can simply replace all imports of `@sentry/angular` with `@sentry/angular-ivy` in our docs.
Since version 8, the Sentry Angular SDK is Ivy-compatible by default.
