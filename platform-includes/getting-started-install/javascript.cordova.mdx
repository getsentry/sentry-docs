Install our SDK using the `cordova` command:

```bash
cordova plugin add sentry-cordova
```

The [Sentry Wizard](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-wizard) will patch your project. You need to do this only once, then the created files can go into your version control system.

### iOS Specifics

When you use Xcode, you can hook directly into the build process to upload debug symbols and source maps.
