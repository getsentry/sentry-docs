The minimum version for watchOS is 2.0. Our SDK has limited symbolication support and no crash or app hang detection for watchOS.

We recommend installing the SDK with Swift Package Manager (SPM), but we also support alternate [installation methods](install/). To integrate Sentry into your Xcode project, open your App in Xcode and open **File > Add Packages**. Then add the SDK by entering the git repo url in the top right search field:

```
https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa.git
```
