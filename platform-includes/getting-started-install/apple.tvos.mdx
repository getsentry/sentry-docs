The minimum version for tvOS is 9.0.

We recommend installing the SDK with CocoaPods, but we also support alternate [installation methods](install/). To integrate Sentry into your Xcode project, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby {filename:Podfile}
platform :tvos, '9.0'
use_frameworks! # This is important

target 'YourApp' do
  pod 'Sentry', :git => 'https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa.git', :tag => '{{@inject packages.version('sentry.cocoa') }}'
end
```

Then run `pod install`.
