We recommend installing the SDK through our installation wizard by running the following command inside your project directory:

```bash
brew install getsentry/tools/sentry-wizard && sentry-wizard -i ios
```

The wizard will prompt you to log in to Sentry. It'll then automatically do the following steps for you:

- install the Sentry SDK via Swift Package Manager or Cocoapods
- update your `AppDelegate` or SwiftUI App Initializer with the default Sentry configuration and an example error
- add a new `Upload Debug Symbols` phase to your `xcodebuild` build script
- create `.sentryclirc` with an auth token to upload debug symbols (this file is automatically added to `.gitignore`)
- when you're using Fastlane, it will add a Sentry lane for uploading debug symbols

After the wizard setup is completed, the SDK will automatically capture unhandled exceptions, and monitor performance.
You can also <PlatformLink to="/usage/">manually capture errors</PlatformLink>.

<Note>

If the setup through the wizard doesn't work for you, you can also <PlatformLink to="/manual-setup/">set up the SDK manually</PlatformLink>.
