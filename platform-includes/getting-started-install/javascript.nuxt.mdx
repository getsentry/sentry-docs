We recommend installing the SDK by running our installation wizard in the root directory of your project:

```bash
npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i nuxt
```

The wizard will prompt you to log in to Sentry. It will then automatically do the following steps for you:

- create or update Nuxt files with the default Sentry configuration:
  - `sentry.(client|server).config.ts` to initialize the SDK
  - `nuxt.config.ts` to add build options to add source maps upload and auto-instrumentation via Vite plugins.
- create a `.env.sentry-build-plugin` file with an auth token to upload source maps (this file is automatically added to `.gitignore`)
- add an example page to your frontend app and your server to verify your Sentry setup

After the wizard setup is completed, the SDK will automatically capture unhandled errors, and monitor performance.

You can also <PlatformLink to="/usage/">manually capture errors</PlatformLink>.

<Alert>
  If the setup through the wizard doesn't work for you, you can also <PlatformLink to="/manual-setup/">set up the SDK manually</PlatformLink>.
