We recommend installing the SDK through our installation wizard by running the following command inside your project directory:

```bash
brew install getsentry/tools/sentry-wizard && sentry-wizard -i android
```

The wizard will prompt you to log in to Sentry. It'll then automatically do the following steps for you:

- update your app's `build.gradle` file with the Sentry Gradle plugin and configure it
- update your `AndroidManifest.xml` with the default Sentry configuration
- create `sentry.properties` with an auth token to upload proguard mappings (this file is automatically added to `.gitignore`)
- add an example error to your app's Main Activity to verify your Sentry setup

After the wizard setup is completed, the SDK will automatically capture unhandled exceptions, and monitor performance.
You can also <PlatformLink to="/usage/">manually capture errors</PlatformLink>.

<Note>

If the setup through the wizard doesn't work for you, you can also <PlatformLink to="/manual-setup/">set up the SDK manually</PlatformLink>.
