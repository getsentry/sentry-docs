To install Sentry using the installation wizard, run the following command within your project:

```bash
npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i nextjs
```

The wizard then guides you through the setup process, asking you to enable additional (optional) Sentry features for your application beyond error monitoring.

<Expandable title="Want to learn more about these features?">

- [**Issues**](/product/issues) (always enabled): Sentry's core error monitoring product that automatically reports errors,
  uncaught exceptions, and unhandled rejections. If you have something that
  looks like an exception, Sentry can capture it.
- [**Tracing**](/product/tracing): Track software performance while seeing the
  impact of errors across multiple systems. For example, distributed tracing
  allows you to follow a request from the frontend to the backend and back.
- [**Session Replay**](/product/explore/session-replay/web):
  Get to the root cause of an issue faster by viewing a video-like reproduction
  of what was happening in the user's browser before, during, and after the
  problem.

This guide assumes that you enable all features and allow the wizard to create an example page and route. You can add or remove features at any time, but setting them up now will save you the effort of configuring them manually later.

<Expandable title="What does the installation wizard change inside your application?">

- Creates config files with the default `Sentry.init()` calls for all runtimes (Node.js, Browser, and Edge)
- Adds a Next.js instrumentation hook to your project (`instrumentation.ts`)
- Creates or updates your Next.js config with the default Sentry settings
- Creates error handling components (`global-error.(jsx|tsx)` and `_error.jsx` for the Pages Router) if they don't already exist
- Creates `.sentryclirc` with an auth token to upload source maps (this file is automatically added to `.gitignore`)
- Adds an example page and route to your application to help verify your Sentry setup
