To install Sentry using the installation wizard, run the following command within your project:

```bash
npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i nextjs
```

The wizard starts guiding you through the setup process, which also includes enabling the Sentry features listed above.

<Alert level="warning" title="Important">

This guide assumes you enable all Sentry features during the wizard setup and allow it to create an example page and route. If you make different choices, you can still follow along, but you may need to make adjustments as you proceed.

</Alert>

You can always add or remove config options manually later if needed. Though, the earlier you set these up, the better.

<Expandable title="What does the installation wizard change inside your application?">

- Create config files with the default `Sentry.init()` calls for all runtimes (Node.js, Browser, and Edge)
- Add a Next.js instrumentation hook to your project (`instrumentation.ts`)
- Create or update your Next.js config with the default Sentry settings
- Create `.sentryclirc` with an auth token to upload source maps (this file is automatically added to `.gitignore`)
- Add an example page and route to your application to help verify your Sentry setup
