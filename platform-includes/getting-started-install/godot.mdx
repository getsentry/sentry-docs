Download the latest stable version `{{@inject packages.version('sentry.godot', '?') }}` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/releases/). Extract the `addons/sentry` folder from the archive into your project.

<Alert>

Ensure that the addon is placed in the `addons/sentry` folder, preserving the exact casing.

</Alert>

A separate **demo project** archive is also available on the releases page. It contains a ready-to-run Godot project with examples of common features like error capturing, breadcrumbs, and user feedback. To use it, enter your DSN in **Project Settings > Sentry > Options**.
