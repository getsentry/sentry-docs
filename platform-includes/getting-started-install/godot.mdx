Download the latest stable version `{{@inject packages.version('sentry.godot', '?') }}` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/releases/). The archive includes the Sentry SDK addon and a demo project. You can either extract the entire archive into a separate folder to open the demo in Godot Engine or extract only `addons/sentry` into existing project.

<Alert>

Ensure that the addon is placed exactly as it is in the demo project, in the `addons/sentry` folder, preserving the exact casing.
