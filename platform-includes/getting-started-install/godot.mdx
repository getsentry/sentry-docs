Download the latest release on Github: [`sentry-godot#{{@inject packages.version('sentry.godot', '0.0.5') }}`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/releases/). The archive includes the Sentry SDK addon and a demo project. You can either extract it into a separate folder to open the demo in Godot Engine or extract only `addons/sentrysdk` into your own project.

<Alert>

Ensure that the addon is placed exactly as it is in the demo project, in the `addons/sentrysdk` folder, preserving the exact casing.
