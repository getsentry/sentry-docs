The User Feedback integration is already included with the Sentry SDK. We recommend installing the SDK through our installation wizard:

```bash
npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i remix
```

The wizard will prompt you to log in to Sentry. It will then automatically do the following steps for you:

- create two files in the root directory of your project, `entry.client.tsx` and `entry.server.tsx` (if they don't already exist).
- add the default `Sentry.init()` for the client in `entry.client.tsx` and the server in `entry.server.tsx`.
- create `.sentryclirc` with an auth token to upload source maps (this file is automatically added to `.gitignore`).
- adjust your `build` script in `package.json` to automatically upload source maps to Sentry when you build your application.
- add an example page to your app to verify your Sentry setup

If you use [Remix future flags](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/pages/api-development-strategy#current-future-flags), the wizard will instrument your application accordingly to support Remix v2 features.

After the wizard setup is completed, the SDK will automatically capture unhandled errors, and monitor performance.
You can also <PlatformLink to="/usage/">manually capture errors</PlatformLink>.

<Note>

If the wizard setup isn't working for you, you can <PlatformLink to="/manual-setup/">set up the SDK manually</PlatformLink>.
