```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nuxt";

const eventId = Sentry.captureMessage("User Feedback");
// OR: const eventId = Sentry.lastEventId();

const userFeedback = {
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "john@doe.com",
  message: "I really like your App, thanks!",
  associatedEventId: eventId,
};
Sentry.captureFeedback(userFeedback);
```

You can also attach further data to the feedback event by passing a hint as a second argument. This is similar to other `capture` methods:

```javascript
const base64ScreenShot = 'data:image/jpeg;base64...';
const res = await fetch(base64ScreenShot);
const buffer = await res.arrayBuffer();

Sentry.captureFeedback(
  { message: "I really like your App, thanks!" },
  {
    captureContext: {
      tags: { key: "value" },
    },
    attachments: [
      {
        filename: "screenshot.png",
        data: new Uint8Array(buffer),
      },
    ],
  }
);
```
