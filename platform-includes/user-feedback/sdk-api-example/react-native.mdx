```typescript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react-native";
import { SendFeedbackParams } from "@sentry/react-native";

const sentryId = Sentry.captureMessage("My Message");
// OR: const sentryId = Sentry.lastEventId();

const userFeedback: SendFeedbackParams = {
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "john@doe.com",
  message: "Hello World!",
  associatedEventId: eventId, // Optional
};

Sentry.captureFeedback(userFeedback);
```

You can also attach further data to the feedback event by passing a hint as a second argument. This is similar to other `capture` methods:

```javascript
Sentry.captureFeedback(
  { message: "I really like your App, thanks!" },
  {
    captureContext: {
      tags: { key: "value" },
    },
    attachments: [
      {
        filename: 'hello.txt',
        data: 'Hello, World!',
      },
    ],
  }
);
```
