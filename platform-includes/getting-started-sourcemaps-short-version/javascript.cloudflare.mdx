The stack traces in your Sentry errors probably won't look like your actual code. To fix this, upload your source maps to Sentry.

First, set the `upload_source_maps` option to `true` in your `wrangler.(jsonc|toml)` config file to enable source map uploading:

```jsonc {tabTitle:JSON} {filename:wrangler.jsonc}
{
  "upload_source_maps": true,
}
```

```toml {tabTitle:Toml} {filename:wrangler.toml}
upload_source_maps = true
```

Next, run the Sentry Wizard to finish your setup:

```bash
npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i sourcemaps
```
