The stack traces in your Sentry errors probably won't look like your actual code without unminifying them. To fix this, upload your <PlatformLink to="/sourcemaps/">source maps</PlatformLink> to Sentry. The easiest way to do this is by using the Sentry Wizard:

```bash
npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i sourcemaps
```
