### View Captured Data in Sentry

Now, head over to your project on [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io) to view the collected data (it takes a couple of moments for the data to appear).

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-verify-locate-data" />

At this point, you should have integrated Sentry into your JavaScript application and should already be sending data to your Sentry project.

Now's a good time to customize your setup and look into more advanced topics. Our next recommended steps for you are:

- Extend Sentry to your backend using one of our [SDKs](/)
- Learn how to [manually capture errors](/platforms/javascript/usage/)
- Continue to [customize your configuration](/platforms/javascript/configuration/)
- Get familiar with [Sentry's product features](/product) like tracing, insights, and alerts
