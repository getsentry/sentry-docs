Throw an error in a loader to verify that Sentry is working.
After opening this route in your browser, you should see two errors in the Sentry issue stream, one captured from the server and one captured from the client.

```tsx {filename: error.tsx}
import type { Route } from "./+types/example-page";

export async function loader() {
  throw new Error("some error thrown in a loader");
}

export default function ExamplePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      Loading this page will throw an error
    </div>
  );
}

```
