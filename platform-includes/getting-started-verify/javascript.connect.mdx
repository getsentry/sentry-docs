### Issues

First, let's make sure Sentry is correctly capturing errors and creating issues in your project. Add the following code snippet to your main application file; it defines a route that will deliberately trigger an error when called:

```javascript
app.use("/debug-sentry", (req, res) => {
  throw new Error("My first Sentry error!");
});
```

### Tracing

To test your tracing configuration, update the previous code snippet by starting a trace to measure the time it takes for the execution of your code:

```javascript
app.use("/debug-sentry", async (req, res) => {
    await Sentry.startSpan(
      {
        op: "test",
        name: "My First Test Transaction",
      },
      async () => {
        await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
        throw new Error("My first Sentry error!");
      }
    );
  }
});
```
