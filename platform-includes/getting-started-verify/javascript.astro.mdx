Trigger a test error somewhere in your Astro app, for example in one of your pages:

```html {filename: home.astro}
<button onclick="throw new Error('This is a test error')">
  Throw test error
</button>
```

<Alert>

Errors triggered from within Browser DevTools are sandboxed and won't trigger an error handler. Place the snippet directly in your code instead.
