### Issues

First, let's verify that Sentry captures errors and creates issues in your Sentry project. Add the following code snippet to your main application file, which will call an undefined function, triggering an error that Sentry will capture:

```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
  try {
    foo();
  } catch (e) {
    Sentry.captureException(e);
  }
}, 99);
```

### Tracing
To test your tracing configuration, update the previous code snippet by starting a performance trace to measure the time it takes for the execution of your code:
```javascript
Sentry.startSpan({
  op: "test",
  name: "My First Test Transaction",
}, () => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    try {
      foo();
    } catch (e) {
      Sentry.captureException(e);
    }
  }, 99);
});
```
