### Issues

First, let's verify that Sentry captures errors and creates issues in your Sentry project. Add the following route to your application, which will call an undefined function, triggering an error that Sentry will capture:

```javascript
@Get("/debug-sentry")
  getError() {
    try {
      foo();
    } catch (e) {
      Sentry.captureException(e);
    }
  }
```

### Tracing

To test your tracing configuration, update the previous code snippet by starting a performance trace to measure the time it takes for the execution of your code:

```javascript
@Get("/debug-sentry")
  getError() {
    Sentry.startSpan(
	  {
	    op: "test",
	    name: "My First Test Transaction",
	  },
	  () => {
	    setTimeout(() => {
	      try {
	        foo();
	      } catch (e) {
	        Sentry.captureException(e);
	      }
	    }, 99);
	  },
	);
}
```
