### Issues

First, let's make sure Sentry is correctly capturing errors and creating issues in your project. Add the following code snippet to your main application file; it defines a route that will deliberately trigger an error when called:

```javascript
router.get("/debug-sentry", function() {
  throw new Error("My first Sentry error!");
});
```

To test your tracing configuration, update the previous code snippet by starting a trace to measure the time it takes for the execution of your code:

```javascript
router.get("/debug-sentry", async (ctx) => {
  await Sentry.startSpan(
    {
      op: "test",
      name: "My First Test Transaction",
    },
    async () => {
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
      throw new Error("My first Sentry error!");
    }
  );
});
```
