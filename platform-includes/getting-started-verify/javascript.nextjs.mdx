## Step 2: Verify Your Setup

<Include name="nextjs-turbopack-warning-expandable.mdx" />

If you haven't tested your Sentry configuration yet, let's do it now. You can confirm that Sentry is working properly and sending data to your Sentry project by using the example page and route created by the installation wizard:

1. Open the example page `/sentry-example-page` in your browser. For most Next.js applications, this will be at localhost.
2. Click the "Throw error" button. This triggers two errors:
   - a frontend error
   - an error within the API route

Sentry captures both of these errors for you. Additionally, the button click starts a performance trace to measure the time it takes for the API request to complete.

Don't forget to explore the example files' code in your project to understand what's happening after your button click.

### View Captured Data in Sentry

Now, head over to your project on [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io) to view the collected data (it takes a couple of moments for the data to appear).

<Alert level="warning" title="Important">

Errors triggered from within your browser's developer tools (i.e., the browser console) are sandboxed, so they will not trigger Sentry's error monitoring.
