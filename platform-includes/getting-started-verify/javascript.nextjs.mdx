## Step 3: Verify Your Setup

Let's confirm that Sentry is working properly and sending data to your Sentry project by using the example page and route created by the installation wizard.

1. Open the example page at [http://localhost:3000/sentry-example-page](http://localhost:3000/sentry-example-page)
2. Click the "Throw error" button. This triggers two errors:
   - a frontend error
   - an error within the API route

Sentry will capture both of these errors for you. Additionally, the button click starts a performance trace to measure the time it takes for the API request to complete.

Make sure to explore the example files' code in your project to understand what's happening after your button click.

### View Captured Data in Sentry

Now head over to your Sentry project on [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io) to view the collected data (it takes a couple of moments for the data to appear).

<Alert level="warning" title="Important">

Errors triggered from within your browser's developer tools are sandboxed, so they will not trigger Sentry's error monitoring.
