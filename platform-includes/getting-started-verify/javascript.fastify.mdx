### Issues

First, let's verify that Sentry captures errors and creates issues in your Sentry project. Add the following code snippet to your main application file that defines a route that triggers an error when called:

```javascript
app.get("/debug-sentry", function mainHandler(req, res) {
  throw new Error("My first Sentry error!");
});
```

### Tracing

To test your tracing configuration, update the previous code snippet by starting a trace to measure the time it takes for the execution of your code:

```javascript
app.get("/debug-sentry", async function mainHandler(request, reply) {
  await Sentry.startSpan(
    {
      op: "test",
      name: "My First Test Transaction",
    },
    async () => {
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 100)); // Wait for 100ms
      throw new Error("My first Sentry error!");
    }
  );
});
```
