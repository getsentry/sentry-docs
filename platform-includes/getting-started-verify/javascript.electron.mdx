Verify your setup by adding the following snippet anywhere in your code and running it:

```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
  throw new Error();
});
```

You may want to try inserting this into both your `main` and any `renderer`
processes to verify Sentry is operational in both.

You can verify that native crash reporting is working by triggering a crash in the current process:

```javascript
process.crash();
```

Note: Native crashes in the Electron `main` process are not sent until the app is run again.
