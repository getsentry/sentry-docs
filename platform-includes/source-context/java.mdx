You'll need to enable the Source Context feature to see your source code as part of stack traces in Sentry. You can either do this:

- By adding one of a build tool plugin to your project
- Or, by manually uploading your source bundle using the Sentry CLI

This document covers both methods. You can find more information about uploading via the CLI in our [Debug Information Files](/product/cli/dif/#jvm-source-bundles) docs.

<PlatformSection supported={["android"]}>

Source Context also works with ProGuard. See the [ProGuard & DexGuard](/platforms/android/enhance-errors/proguard/) docs for more information.

</PlatformSection>

### UUIDs

A random UUID must be generated and placed into the `sentry-debug-meta.properties`. The same UUID must be used to upload the source bundle file. Whenever an error is sent to Sentry, this UUID is sent alongside the error, allowing
the Sentry server to look up source code in the source bundle with a matching ID.

If you're using a build tool plugin, these steps happen automatically.

![Java Source Context](./img/java-source-context.png)

All of the following methods require `org`, `project` and an `authToken`.

You can create an auth token by visiting the
[Organization Auth Tokens](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/settings/auth-tokens/) settings page in Sentry.io.

## Known Limitations

- Files with same name but different extensions will lead to undefined behavior
  - e.g. MainActivity.java and MainActivity.kt will both be renamed to MainActivity.jvm
- Package declaration and file tree must match for source lookup to work
  - e.g. a class io.sentry.sample.MainActivity.java has to be stored in io/sentry/sample

<PlatformSection supported={["android"]}>

- Kotlin files are allowed to contain multiple classes but code obfuscation tools like ProGuard or R8 may prevent this from working correctly
- We don't add generated sources for AGP < 7.4

</PlatformSection>

## Using the Gradle Build Tool Plugin

We have a [Sentry Gradle Plugin](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-android-gradle-plugin) available.

Set the auth token as an environment variable to be used when running your release build.

<OrgAuthTokenNote />

```bash
export SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=___ORG_AUTH_TOKEN___
```

Add the Sentry Gradle plugin to your project by adding the following lines:

<PlatformSection supported={["android"]}>


```groovy
plugins {
    id "io.sentry.android.gradle" version "{{@inject packages.version('sentry.java.android.gradle-plugin', '3.9.0') }}"
}

sentry {
    // Enables more detailed log output, e.g. for sentry-cli.
    //
    // Default is false.
    debug = true

    // Generates a JVM (Java, Kotlin, etc.) source bundle and uploads your source code to Sentry.
    // This enables source context, allowing you to see your source
    // code as part of your stack traces in Sentry.
    //
    // Default is disabled.
    includeSourceContext = true

    // Includes additional source directories into the source bundle.
    // These directories are resolved relative to the project directory.
    additionalSourceDirsForSourceContext = ["mysrc/java", "other-source-dir/main/kotlin"]

    org = "___ORG_SLUG___"
    projectName = "___PROJECT_SLUG___"
    authToken = System.getenv("SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN")
}
```

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("io.sentry.android.gradle") version "{{@inject packages.version('sentry.java.android.gradle-plugin', '3.9.0') }}"
}

sentry {
    // Enables more detailed log output, e.g. for sentry-cli.
    //
    // Default is false.
    debug.set(true)

    // Generates a JVM (Java, Kotlin, etc.) source bundle and uploads your source code to Sentry.
    // This enables source context, allowing you to see your source
    // code as part of your stack traces in Sentry.
    //
    // Default is disabled.
    includeSourceContext.set(true)

    // Includes additional source directories into the source bundle.
    // These directories are resolved relative to the project directory.
    additionalSourceDirsForSourceContext.set(setOf("mysrc/java", "other-source-dir/main/kotlin"))

    org.set("___ORG_SLUG___")
    projectName.set("___PROJECT_SLUG___")
    authToken.set(System.getenv("SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN"))
}
```

</PlatformSection>

Make sure the `assemble` task is executed.


```groovy
plugins {
    id "io.sentry.jvm.gradle" version "{{@inject packages.version('sentry.java.android.gradle-plugin', '3.9.0') }}"
}

sentry {
    // Enables more detailed log output, e.g. for sentry-cli.
    //
    // Default is false.
    debug = true

    // Generates a JVM (Java, Kotlin, etc.) source bundle and uploads your source code to Sentry.
    // This enables source context, allowing you to see your source
    // code as part of your stack traces in Sentry.
    //
    // Default is disabled.
    includeSourceContext = true

    // Includes additional source directories into the source bundle.
    // These directories are resolved relative to the project directory.
    additionalSourceDirsForSourceContext = ["mysrc/java", "other-source-dir/main/kotlin"]

    org = "___ORG_SLUG___"
    projectName = "___PROJECT_SLUG___"
    authToken = System.getenv("SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN")
}
```

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("io.sentry.jvm.gradle") version "{{@inject packages.version('sentry.java.android.gradle-plugin', '3.9.0') }}"
}

sentry {
    // Enables more detailed log output, e.g. for sentry-cli.

    // These directories are resolved relative to the project directory.
    additionalSourceDirsForSourceContext.set(setOf("mysrc/java", "other-source-dir/main/kotlin"))

    org.set("___ORG_SLUG___")
    projectName.set("___PROJECT_SLUG___")
    authToken.set(System.getenv("SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN"))
}
```

### Include NDK Source Context with Gradle Plugin

By default native code (C/C++) is not uploaded with the Java/Kotlin code. Add the following options to enable Source Context for native code:

```groovy
sentry {
    // Includes the source code of native code when uploading native symbols for Sentry.
    // This executes sentry-cli with the --include-sources param. automatically so
    // you don't need to do it manually. This only works with uploadNativeSymbols enabled.
    //
    // Default is disabled.
    includeNativeSources = true

    // Enables the automatic configuration of Native Symbols for Sentry.
    // This executes sentry-cli automatically so you don't need to do it manually.
    //
    // Default is disabled.
    uploadNativeSymbols = true
}
```

```kotlin
sentry {
    // Includes the source code of native code when uploading native symbols for Sentry.
    // This executes sentry-cli with the --include-sources param. automatically so
    // you don't need to do it manually. This only works with uploadNativeSymbols enabled.
    //
    // Default is disabled.
    includeNativeSources.set(true)

    // Enables the automatic configuration of Native Symbols for Sentry.
    // This executes sentry-cli automatically so you don't need to do it manually.
    //
    // Default is disabled.
    uploadNativeSymbols.set(true)
}
```

</PlatformSection>

### Source Context for Generated Code

If you have a code generation step in your build (e.g. Quarkus) you will see an error similar to this:

```
Task ':xxx:sentryCollectSourcesJava' uses this output of task ':xxx:quarkusGenerateCode' without declaring an explicit or implicit dependency. This can lead to incorrect results being produced, depending on what order the tasks are executed.
```

To resolve this, declare a task dependency for `sentryCollectSourcesJava` on code generation tasks that exist in your build:

```groovy
tasks.named("sentryCollectSourcesJava") {
    // Make the task run after the tasks that generate code during build
    mustRunAfter("CodeGenTask1", "CodeGenTask2")
}
```

```kotlin
tasks.named("sentryCollectSourcesJava") {
    // Make the task run after the tasks that generate code during build
    mustRunAfter("CodeGenTask1", "CodeGenTask2")
}
```

## Using the Maven Build Tool Plugin

We have a [Sentry Maven Plugin](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-maven-plugin) available.

Set the auth token as an environment variable to be used when running your release build.

<OrgAuthTokenNote />

```bash
export SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=___ORG_AUTH_TOKEN___
```

Add the Sentry Maven Plugin to your project by adding the following lines to your `pom.xml` file:


```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>io.sentry</groupId>
            <artifactId>sentry-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>{{@inject packages.version('sentry.java.maven-plugin', '0.0.2') }}</version>
            <!-- Required to allow auto-install of Sentry SDK and Integrations -->
            <extensions>true</extensions>
            <configuration>
                <!-- for showing output of sentry-cli -->
                <debugSentryCli>true</debugSentryCli>

                <!-- optionally specify the path to sentry-cli -->
                <!-- download it here: https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cli/releases -->
                <!-- minimum required version is 2.21.2 -->
                <!-- by default the sentry-cli bundled with the plugin will be used -->
                <!-- <sentryCliExecutablePath>/path/to/sentry-cli</sentryCliExecutablePath> -->

                <org>___ORG_SLUG___</org>

                <project>___PROJECT_SLUG___</project>

                <!-- in case you're self hosting, provide the URL here -->
                <!--<url>http://localhost:8000/</url>-->

                <!-- provide your auth token via SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN environment variable -->
                <authToken>${env.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN}</authToken>
            </configuration>
            <executions>
                <execution>
                    <goals>
                        <!--  Generates a source bundle and uploads it to Sentry. -->
                        <!--  This enables source context, allowing you to see your source -->
                        <!--  code as part of your stack traces in Sentry. -->
                        <goal>uploadSourceBundle</goal>
                    </goals>
                </execution>
            </executions>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
    ...
</build>
```

You must manually download `sentry-cli` for your required architecture and point
the Maven Plugin to it using `sentryCliExecutablePath`.
You can get the latest release from the following URL:

```
https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cli/releases/tag/{{@inject apps.version('sentry-cli', '2.17.3') }}
```

</PlatformSection>

## Manually Uploading Source Context

If you're using a build tool we don't support, or you prefer not to use Sentry's build tool plugins, you'll need to create and upload source bundle files manually using the Sentry CLI.

The `sentry-cli` commands allow you to supply `--org` and `--project` as well as provide the auth token by setting the `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable.

You can also use a `.sentryclirc` or a `.properties` file, which you can link using the `SENTRY_PROPERTIES` environment variable.

### Creating the Source Bundle

First, create the source bundle containing your source files:

```
sentry-cli debug-files bundle-jvm --output path/to/store/bundle --debug-id A_VALID_UUID path/to/source-code
```

### Uploading the Source Bundle

Next, upload that source bundle to Sentry:

```
sentry-cli debug-files upload --type jvm path/to/bundle
```

### Configuring the SDK

You'll need to tell the SDK which source bundle it should use for providing Source Context via one of the following options:

#### `sentry-debug-meta.properties`

Add a `sentry-debug-meta.properties` file to your application resources at build time which will be picked up automatically by the SDK.

```properties
io.sentry.bundle-ids=A_VALID_UUID
```

#### `sentry.properties`

```properties
bundle-ids=A_VALID_UUID
```

<PlatformSection supported={["java.spring"]}>

#### `application.properties`

```properties
sentry.bundle-ids=A_VALID_UUID`
```

</PlatformSection>

#### `SentryOptions`

```Java
options.addBundleId("A_VALID_UUID");
```

<PlatformSection supported={["android"]}>

## Manually Uploading Debug Symbols and Native Source Code

Upload the native debug symbols manually using the `debug-files upload command`. Adding the `--include-sources` flag, sentry-cli will automatically generate source bundles on the fly and upload them. Here's a typical example for Android:

```
sentry-cli debug-files upload app/build/intermediates/merged_native_libs/ --include-sources
```
