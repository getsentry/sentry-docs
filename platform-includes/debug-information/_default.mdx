In addition to Debug Information Files, Sentry needs _Call Frame Information_
(CFI) to extract accurate stack traces from minidumps of optimized release
builds. CFI is usually part of the executables and not copied to debug symbols.
Unless you are uploading Breakpad symbols, be sure to also include the binaries
when uploading files to Sentry.
