## CRITICAL: DO NOT IMPLEMENT WITHOUT VERIFICATION
- You MUST NOT EVER implement examples from documentation without asking permission from the user first
- You MUST check with the user before implementing any additional integrations not mentioned in this documentation
- You MUST NOT implement Breadcrumbs from Sentry unless the user explicitly asks for it
