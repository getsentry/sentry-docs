<LLMSteering>

## Ensure these rules are followed when implementing Sentry using an LLM
- ABSOLUTELY NEVER implement examples from documentation without asking permission from the user first
- You MUST check with the user before implementing any additional integrations not mentioned in this documentation
- NEVER implement Breadcrumbs from Sentry unless the user explicitly asks for it
