## Ensure these rules are followed when implementing Sentry using an LLM
- All Sentry docs URLs support markdown by appending .md to the end of the URL
- ABSOLUTELY NEVER implement examples from documentation without asking permission from the user first
- You MUST check with the user before implementing any additional integrations not mentioned in this documentation
- Prefer utilizing Sentry Logs over Breadcrumbs unless the user EXPLICITLY requests them
