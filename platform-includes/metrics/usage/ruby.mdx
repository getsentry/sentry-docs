Metrics are enabled by default. Once you initialize the SDK, you can send metrics using the `Sentry.metrics` APIs.

The `metrics` namespace exposes three methods that you can use to capture different types of metric information: `count`, `gauge`, and `distribution`.

### Emit a Counter

Counters are one of the more basic types of metrics and can be used to count certain event occurrences.

To emit a counter, do the following:

```ruby
# Record five total button clicks
Sentry.metrics.count(
	"button_click",
	value: 5,
	attributes: { browser: "Firefox", app_version: "1.0.0" }
)
```

### Emit a Distribution

Distributions help you get the most insights from your data by allowing you to obtain aggregations such as `p90`, `min`, `max`, and `avg`.

To emit a distribution, do the following:

```ruby
# Add '15.0' to a distribution used for tracking the loading times per page.
Sentry.metrics.distribution(
	"page_load",
	15.0,
	unit: "millisecond",
	attributes: { page: "/home" }
)
```

### Emit a Gauge

Gauges let you obtain aggregates like `min`, `max`, `avg`, `sum`, and `count`. They can be represented in a more space-efficient way than distributions, but they can't be used to get percentiles. If percentiles aren't important to you, we recommend using gauges.

To emit a gauge, do the following:

```ruby
# Add '15.0' to a gauge used for tracking the loading times for a page.
Sentry.metrics.gauge(
	"page_load",
	15.0,
	unit: "millisecond",
	attributes: { "page": "/home" }
)
```
