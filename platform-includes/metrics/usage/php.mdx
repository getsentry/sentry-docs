Metrics are enabled by default in the PHP SDK. After the SDK is initialized, you can send metric data through \Sentry\trace_metrics(), which acts as the entry point for recording counts, gauges, and distributions.

## Emit a Counter

Counters are one of the more basic types of metrics and can be used to count certain event occurrences.

To emit a counter, do the following:

```php
// Record five total button clicks
\Sentry\trace_metrics()->count('button-click', 5, ['browser' => 'Firefox', 'app_version' => '1.0.0']);
```

## Emit a Distribution

Distributions help you get the most insights from your data by allowing you to obtain aggregations such as `p90`, `min`, `max`, and `avg`.

To emit a distribution, do the following:

```php
use \Sentry\Metrics\Unit;

// Add '15.0' to a distribution used for tracking the loading times per page.
\Sentry\trace_metrics()->distribution('page-load', 15.0, ['page' => '/home'], Unit::millisecond());
```

## Emit a Gauge

Gauges let you obtain aggregates like `min`, `max`, `avg`, `sum`, and `count`. They can be represented in a more space-efficient way than distributions, but they can't be used to get percentiles. If percentiles aren't important to you, we recommend using gauges.

To emit a gauge, do the following:

```php
use \Sentry\Metrics\Unit;

// Add '15.0' to a gauge used for tracking the loading times per page.
\Sentry\trace_metrics()->gauge('page-load', 15.0, ['page' => '/home'], Unit::millisecond());
```
