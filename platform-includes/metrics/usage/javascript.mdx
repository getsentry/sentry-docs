Once the SDK is initialized, you can send metrics using the `Sentry.metrics` APIs.

The `metrics` namespace exposes three methods that you can use to capture different types of metric information: `count`, `gauge` and `distribution`.

### Counter

Use `count` to track an incrementing value, such as the number of times a button was clicked or a function was called.

```javascript
Sentry.metrics.count("button_click", 1);
```

### Gauge

Use `gauge` to track a value that can go up and down, such as the current memory usage or the number of items in a queue.

```javascript
Sentry.metrics.gauge("queue_depth", 42);
```

### Distribution

Use `distribution` to track the distribution of a value, such as the response time of a request.

```javascript
Sentry.metrics.distribution("response_time", 187.5);
```

### Adding Attributes

You can also pass additional attributes to any of the metric methods via the `attributes` option. Attributes allow you to filter and group metrics.

```javascript
Sentry.metrics.count(
  "button_click",
  1,
  {
    attributes: {
      browser: "Firefox",
      app_version: "1.0.0",
    },
  }
);
```

With version `10.33.0` and above, you can use scope APIs to set attributes on the SDK's scopes which will be applied to all metrics as long as the respective scopes are active. For the time being, only `string`, `number` and `boolean` attribute values are supported.


```js
Sentry.getGlobalScope().setAttributes({ is_admin: true, auth_provider: 'google' });

Sentry.withScope(scope => {
  scope.setAttribute('step', 'authentication');

  // scope attributes `is_admin`, `auth_provider` and `step` are added
  Sentry.metrics.count('clicks', 1, { attributes: { activeSince: 100 } });
  Sentry.metrics.gauge('time_since_refresh', 4, { unit: 'hour' });
});

// scope attributes `is_admin` and `auth_provider` are added
Sentry.metrics.distribution('response_time', 283.33, { unit: 'millisecond' });
```

### Specifying Units

For `gauge` and `distribution` metrics, you can specify a unit using the `unit` option. This helps Sentry display the metric value in a human-readable format.

```javascript
Sentry.metrics.distribution(
  "response_time",
  187.5,
  {
    unit: "millisecond",
  }
);

Sentry.metrics.gauge(
  "memory_usage",
  1024,
  {
    unit: "byte",
  }
);
```
