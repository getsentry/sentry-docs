Once the SDK is initialized, you can send metrics using the `Sentry.metrics` APIs.

The `metrics` namespace exposes three methods that you can use to capture different types of metric information: `count`, `gauge` and `distribution`.

### Counter

Use `count` to track an incrementing value, such as the number of times a button was clicked or a function was called.

```javascript
Sentry.metrics.count("button_click", 1);
```

### Gauge

Use `gauge` to track a value that can go up and down, such as the current memory usage or the number of items in a queue.

```javascript
Sentry.metrics.gauge("queue_depth", 42);
```

### Distribution

Use `distribution` to track the distribution of a value, such as the response time of a request.

```javascript
Sentry.metrics.distribution("response_time", 187.5);
```

### Adding Attributes

You can also pass additional attributes to any of the metric methods via the `attributes` option. Attributes allow you to filter and group metrics.

```javascript
Sentry.metrics.count(
  "button_click",
  1,
  {
    attributes: {
      browser: "Firefox",
      app_version: "1.0.0",
    },
  }
);
```

### Specifying Units

For `gauge` and `distribution` metrics, you can specify a unit using the `unit` option. This helps Sentry display the metric value in a human-readable format.

```javascript
Sentry.metrics.distribution(
  "response_time",
  187.5,
  {
    unit: "millisecond",
  }
);

Sentry.metrics.gauge(
  "memory_usage",
  1024,
  {
    unit: "byte",
  }
);
```
