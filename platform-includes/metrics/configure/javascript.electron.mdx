Metrics work out of the box by calling `Sentry.init`, no further setup is required.

```JavaScript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/electron/main';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
  // Only needed for SDK versions < 8.0.0
  // _experiments: {
  //   metricsAggregator: true,
  // },
});
```
