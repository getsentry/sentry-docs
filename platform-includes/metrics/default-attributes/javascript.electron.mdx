- `release`: The release set in the SDK if defined. This is sent from the SDK as `sentry.release`.
- `sdk.name`: The name of the SDK that sent the metric. This is sent from the SDK as `sentry.sdk.name`.
- `sdk.version`: The version of the SDK that sent the metric. This is sent from the SDK as `sentry.sdk.version`.

### User Attributes

If user information is available in the current scope, the following attributes are added to the log:

- `user.id`: The user ID.
- `user.name`: The username.
- `user.email`: The email address.

### Renderer Process Attributes

The SDK will attach renderer process information as attributes:

- `browser.name` (added during ingestion)
