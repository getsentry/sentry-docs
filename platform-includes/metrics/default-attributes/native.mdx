Sentry automatically attaches these attributes to every metric:

| Attribute            | Description                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `sentry.environment` | Environment from SDK config     |
| `sentry.release`     | Release version from SDK config |
| `sentry.sdk.name`    | SDK name                        |
| `sentry.sdk.version` | SDK version                     |

Metrics are also automatically associated with the current trace context when available.
