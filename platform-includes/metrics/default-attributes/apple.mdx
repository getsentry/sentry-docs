By default the SDK will attach the following attributes to a metric:

### SDK Attributes

- `sentry.sdk.name`: The name of the SDK that sent the metric (e.g., "sentry.cocoa").
- `sentry.sdk.version`: The version of the SDK that sent the metric.
- `sentry.environment`: The environment set in the SDK.
- `sentry.release`: The release set in the SDK, if defined.

### Device and OS Attributes

- `device.brand`: Always "Apple" for Apple devices.
- `device.model`: The device model (e.g., "iPhone14,2").
- `device.family`: The device family (e.g., "iPhone").
- `os.name`: The operating system name (e.g., "iOS").
- `os.version`: The operating system version.

### User Attributes

User attributes are only added when `options.sendDefaultPii` is set to `true`:

- `user.id`: The user ID from the current scope. Falls back to the installation ID if no user is set.
- `user.name`: The username from the current scope.
- `user.email`: The email address from the current scope.

### Trace Attributes

If there is an active span when the metric is recorded, the following attribute is added:

- `span_id`: The span ID of the active span.

<Note>
The `trace_id` is set as a top-level field on the metric (not as an attribute) to enable distributed tracing correlation. When a span is active, the SDK uses that span's trace ID; otherwise, it falls back to the propagation context's trace ID.
</Note>

### Session Replay Attributes

If Session Replay is enabled and active (iOS and tvOS only):

- `sentry.replay_id`: The current replay session ID.
