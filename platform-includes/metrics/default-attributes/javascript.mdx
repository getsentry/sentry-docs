By default the SDK will attach the following attributes to a metric:

- `sentry.environment`: The environment set in the SDK if defined.
- `sentry.release`: The release set in the SDK if defined.
- `sentry.sdk.name`: The name of the SDK that sent the metric.
- `sentry.sdk.version`: The version of the SDK that sent the metric.

### User Attributes

The SDK will optionally attach user information as attributes (guarded by [`sendDefaultPii`](/platforms/javascript/configuration/options/#sendDefaultPii)):

- `user.id`
- `user.name`
- `user.email`


### Browser Attributes

The SDK will attach browser information as attributes:

- `browser.name` (added during ingestion)
- `browser.version` (added during ingestion)
- `sentry.replay_id`: The replay id of the session replay that was active when the metric was collected.

### Server Attributes

Backend SDKs (Node.js, Cloudflare, etc.), will attach the following:

- `server.address`: The address of the server that sent the metric. Equivalent to `server_name` that gets attached to Sentry errors.
