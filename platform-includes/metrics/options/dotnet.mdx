#### EnableMetrics

Set to `false` in order to disable the `SentrySdk.Experimental.Metrics` APIs.

#### SetBeforeSendMetric<T>

To filter metrics, or update them before they are sent to Sentry, you can use the `SetBeforeSendMetric<T>(Func<SentryMetric<T>, SentryMetric<T>?>)` option. If the callback returns `null`, the metric is not emitted. Attributes can also be updated in the callback delegate.

```csharp
SentrySdk.Init(options =>
{
    options.Dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    options.Experimental.SetBeforeSendMetric<int>(static metric =>
    {
        if (metric.Name == "removed-metric")
        {
            return null;
        }

        metric.SetAttribute("extra", "foo");

        return metric;
    };
});
```

The `beforeSendMetric` delegate receives a metric object, and should return the metric object if you want it to be sent to Sentry, or `null` if you want to discard it.

The metric object of type `SentryMetric<T>` has the following members:
- `Timestamp` Property: (`DateTimeOffset`) Timestamp indicating when the metric was emitted.
- `TraceId` Property: (`SentryId`) The trace ID of the trace this metric belongs to.
- `Type` Property: (`SentryMetricType`) The type of metric. One of `Counter`, `Gauge`, `Distribution`.
- `Name` Property: (`string`) The name of the metric.
- `Value` Property: (`T`) The numeric value of the metric.
- `SpanId` Property: (`SpanId?`) The span ID of the span that was active when the metric was emitted.
- `Unit` Property: (`string?`) The unit of measurement for the metric value. Applies to `Gauge` and `Distribution` only.
- `TryGetAttribute<TAttribute>(string key, out TAttribute value)` Method: Gets the attribute value associated with the specified key. Returns `true` if the metric contains an attribute with the specified key and its value is of type `TAttribute`, otherwise `false`.
- `SetAttribute<TAttribute>(string key, TAttribute value)` Method: Sets a key-value pair of data attached to the metric. Supported types are `string`, `bool`, integers up to a size of 64-bit signed, and floating-point numbers up to a size of 64-bit.

The `SentryMetric<T>` is generic, where the provided type argument defines the type of `SentryMetric<T>.Value` and has the same numeric type that the metric was emitted with.
You can register one callback per supported numeric type.
The supported numeric types are `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `float`, and `double`.
