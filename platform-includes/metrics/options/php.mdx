#### before_send_metric

To filter metrics, or update them before they are sent to Sentry, you can use the `before_send_metric` option. If the callback returns `null`, the metric is not emitted. Attributes can also be updated in the callback function.

```php
use \Sentry\Metrics\Types\AbstractType;

\Sentry\init([
    'dsn' => '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
    'before_send_metric' => static function (AbstractType $metric): ?AbstractType {
        if ($metric->getName() === 'removed-metric') {
            return null;
        }
        return $metric;
    }
]);
```

The `before_send_metric` function receives a metric object, and should return the metric object if you want it to be sent to Sentry, or `null` if you want to discard it.
