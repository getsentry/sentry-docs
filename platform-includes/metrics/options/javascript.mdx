The Sentry JavaScript SDK provides several options to configure how metrics are captured and sent to Sentry.

### Disabling Metrics

If you want to disable metrics collection entirely, you can do so by disabling the `_experimental.enableMetrics` flag:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  _experiments: {
    enable_metrics: false,
  }
});
```


### Flushing Metrics

By default, metrics are buffered and flushed depending on buffer size and time. If you need to manually flush metrics before the automatic interval, you can use the `flush` method:

```javascript
await Sentry.flush();
```

This will flush all pending metrics and events to Sentry.
