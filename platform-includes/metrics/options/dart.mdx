The Sentry Dart SDK provides several options to configure how metrics are captured and sent to Sentry.

### Filtering and Modifying Metrics

Use the `beforeSendMetric` callback to filter or modify metrics before they're sent to Sentry. This is useful for:

- Removing sensitive data from metric attributes
- Dropping metrics you don't want to send
- Adding or modifying attributes

The callback receives a metric object and must return either a modified metric or `null` to drop it.

```dart
import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';

await Sentry.init((options) {
  options.dsn = 'your-dsn';
  options.beforeSendMetric = (metric) {
    // Drop metrics with specific attributes
    if (metric.attributes.containsKey('dropmetric')) {
      return null;
    }

    // Return the metric to send it
    return metric;
  };
});
```

### Disabling Metrics

Metrics are enabled by default. To disable metrics collection entirely, set `enableMetrics` to `false`:

```dart
import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';

await Sentry.init((options) {
  options.dsn = 'your-dsn';
  options.enableMetrics = false;
});
```
