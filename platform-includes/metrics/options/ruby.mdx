#### before_send_metric

To filter metrics, or update them before they are sent to Sentry, you can use the `before_send_metric` option. If the callback returns `nil`, the metric is not emitted. Attributes can also be updated in the callback function.

```ruby
Sentry.init do |config|
  config.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"

  config.before_send_metric = lambda do |metric|
    # filter metric
    return nil if metric.name == "removed-metric"

    # add attributes
    metric.attributes[:extra] = "foo"

    # remove attributes
    metric.attributes.delete(:browser) if metric.attributes.has_key?(:browser)

    metric
  end
end
```

The `before_send_metric` function receives a `MetricEvent` object, and should return a `MetricEvent` object if you want it to be sent to Sentry, or `nil` if you want to discard it.

The `MetricEvent` object has the following attributes:

- `name`: (`String`) The name of the metric.
- `type`: (`Symbol`) - one of `:counter`, `:gauge`, `:distribution`) The type of metric.
- `value`: (`Float`) The numeric value of the metric.
- `unit`: (`Optional[String]`) The unit of measurement for the metric value.
- `attributes`: (`Hash`) Additional attributes to be sent with the metric.
- `timestamp`: (`Time`) Timestamp indicating when the metric was recorded.
- `trace_id`: (`Optional[String]`) The trace ID of the trace this metric belongs to.
- `span_id`: (`Optional[String]`) The span ID of the span that was active when the metric was emitted.
