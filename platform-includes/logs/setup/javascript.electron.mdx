To enable logging, you need to initialize the SDK in the renderer and main processes with the `_experiments.enableLogs` option set to `true`.

First update the main process file.

```js
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/electron/main";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  // Enable logs to be sent to Sentry
  _experiments: { enableLogs: true },
});
```

Then update all your renderer processes.

```js
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/electron/renderer";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  // Enable logs to be sent to Sentry
  _experiments: { enableLogs: true },
});
```
