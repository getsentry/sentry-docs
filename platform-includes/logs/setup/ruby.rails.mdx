To enable logging, initialize the SDK with `enable_logs` set to `true`:

```ruby
Sentry.init do |config|
  config.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
  config.enable_logs = true
end
```

This enables:
- The `Sentry.logger` API for explicit logging
- Automatic structured logging of Rails framework events (ActiveRecord queries, controller actions, etc.)

See the [Usage](#usage) section for examples and [Options](#options) to customize which events are captured.
