To configure Sentry as a log channel, add the following config to the `channels` section in `config/logging.php`. If this file does not exist, run `php artisan config:publish logging` to publish it.

```php {filename:config/logging.php}
'channels' => [
    // ...
    'sentry_logs' => [
        'driver' => 'sentry_logs',
    ],
],
```

After you configured the Sentry log channel, you can configure your app to both log to a log file and to Sentry by modifying the log stack:

```bash {filename:.env}
# ...
LOG_STACK=single,sentry_logs
# ...
```

Optionally, you can set the logging level:

```php {filename:config/logging.php}
'channels' => [
    // ...
    'sentry_logs' => [
        'driver' => 'sentry_logs',
        // The minimum logging level at which this handler will be triggered
        // Available levels: debug, info, notice, warning, error, critical, alert, emergency
        'level' => env('LOG_LEVEL', 'info'),
    ],
    // ...
],
```
