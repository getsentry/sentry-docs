import {Alert} from "../../../src/components/alert";```bash {filename:.env}
# ...
LOG_CHANNEL=stack
LOG_STACK=single,sentry_logs
# ...
```

You will also need to configure the Sentry Laravel SDK to enable the logging integration. You can do this by updating your `.env` file to include the following:

```bash {filename:.env}
# ...
SENTRY_ENABLE_LOGS=true
# ...
```

You can configure your log level by setting `LOG_LEVEL` or if you want a log level just for Sentry, you can use
`SENTRY_LOG_LEVEL`:

```bash {filename:.env}
# ...
LOG_LEVEL=info # defaults to debug
SENTRY_LOG_LEVEL=warning # defaults to LOG_LEVEL
# ...
```

Also make sure your `config/sentry.php` file is up to date. You can find the latest version on [GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-laravel/blob/master/config/sentry.php).

<Alert title="Note">

If you are using the Sentry Laravel SDK version `4.16.0` or lower, you need to configure the log channel manually as described below.

</Alert>

To configure Sentry as a log channel, add the following config to the `channels` section in `config/logging.php`. If this file does not exist, run `php artisan config:publish logging` to publish it.

```php {filename:config/logging.php}
'channels' => [
    // ...
    'sentry_logs' => [
        'driver' => 'sentry_logs',
        // The minimum logging level at which this handler will be triggered
        // Available levels: debug, info, notice, warning, error, critical, alert, emergency
        'level' => env('LOG_LEVEL', 'info'), // defaults to `debug` if not set
    ],
],
```
