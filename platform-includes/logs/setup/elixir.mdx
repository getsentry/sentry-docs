To enable logging, set `enable_logs: true` in your Sentry configuration:

```elixir
# In config/config.exs or config/runtime.exs
config :sentry,
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  enable_logs: true
```

When `enable_logs` is `true`, the SDK **automatically attaches** a `Sentry.LoggerHandler` (registered as `:sentry_log_handler`) on application startup. No manual handler setup is required.

<Alert>
If you already have a `Sentry.LoggerHandler` registered (for example, for crash and error reporting), the SDK will not add a second one — your existing handler will also capture logs.
</Alert>

To configure the minimum log level and other options, use the `:logs` key:

```elixir
config :sentry,
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  enable_logs: true,
  logs: [
    level: :info,         # minimum log level (default: :info)
    excluded_domains: [], # logger domains to exclude (default: [])
    metadata: []          # metadata keys to include as attributes (default: [])
  ]
```

<Alert>

Log events are automatically batched and delivered through the SDK's Telemetry Processor, which buffers log entries and sends them to Sentry efficiently. See the <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#telemetry-processor-options">Telemetry Processor options</PlatformLink> for configuration details.
