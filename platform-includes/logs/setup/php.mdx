To enable logging, you need to initialize the SDK with the `enable_logs` option set to `true`.

```php
\Sentry\init([
    'dsn' => '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
    // Enable logs to be sent to Sentry
    'enable_logs' => true,
]);

// Somewhere at the end of your execution, you should flush the logger to send pending logs to Sentry.
\Sentry\logger()->flush();
```

## Using with Monolog

If you're already using [Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog), you can use the `\Sentry\Monolog\LogsHandler` to send logs directly through your existing logging setup:

```php
use Monolog\Level;
use Monolog\Logger;

\Sentry\init([
    'dsn' => '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
    'enable_logs' => true,
]);

$log = new Logger('app');
$log->pushHandler(new \Sentry\Monolog\LogsHandler(
    hub: \Sentry\SentrySdk::getCurrentHub(),
    level: Level::Info,
));

// Your existing Monolog usage will now send logs to Sentry
$log->info('Application started');

// Don't forget to flush
\Sentry\logger()->flush();
```

For more details, see the [Monolog integration documentation](/platforms/php/integrations/monolog/#logs).
