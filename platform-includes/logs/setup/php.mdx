To enable logging, you need to initialize the SDK with the `enable_logs` option set to `true`.

```php
\Sentry\init([
    'dsn' => '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
    // Enable logs to be sent to Sentry
    'enable_logs' => true,
]);

// Somewhere at the end of your execution, you should flush the logger to send pending logs to Sentry.
\Sentry\logger()->flush();
```
