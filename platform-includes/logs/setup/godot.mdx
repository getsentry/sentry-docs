To enable logging in your Godot project, you need to configure the Sentry SDK with Logs enabled.

### Project Settings Configuration

Structured logs are enabled by default. If you want to modify this setting, navigate to **Project Settings** in Godot, then go to **Sentry > Options** and adjust the **Enable Logs** option as needed.

### Programmatic Configuration

Structured logs are enabled by default. If needed, you can disable logs programmatically when initializing the SDK:

```GDScript
SentrySDK.init(func(options: SentryOptions) -> void:
	options.enable_logs = false
)
```
