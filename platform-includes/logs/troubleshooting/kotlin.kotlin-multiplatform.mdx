### Missing Logs for Crashes

Logs can get lost in certain crash scenarios, if the SDK can not send the logs before the app terminates. We are currently working on improving ([#1](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/issues/4690), [#2](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/issues/5660)) this to ensure that all logs are sent, at the latest on the next app restart.
