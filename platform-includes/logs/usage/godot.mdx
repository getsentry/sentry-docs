Once the feature is enabled on the SDK and the SDK is initialized, you can send logs using the `SentrySDK.logger` APIs.

The `SentrySDK.logger` exposes six methods that you can use to log messages at different log levels: `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, and `fatal`.

```GDScript
SentrySDK.logger.trace("Initialized inventory database")
SentrySDK.logger.debug("Player inventory updated")
SentrySDK.logger.info("Level loaded successfully")
SentrySDK.logger.warn("Item configuration not found")
SentrySDK.logger.error("Failed to save game state")
SentrySDK.logger.fatal("Inventory data corrupted")
```

<Alert level="info">

Support for log attributes and string interpolation will be added in future releases.

### Godot Logging Integration

When the feature is enabled, the SDK automatically captures Godot messages, warnings, and errors as logs. You can use `print()`, `push_warning()`, and `push_error()` as usual. These show up as `info`, `warning`, and `error` logs. The SDK also turns runtime errors and warnings into events based on your configuration.
