Once you have configured the Sentry log handler, you can use your regular `LoggerInterface`. It will send logs to Sentry:

```php
$this->logger->info("This is an info message");
$this->logger->warning('User {id} failed to login.', ['id' => $user->id]);
$this->logger->error("This is an error message");
```

You can pass additional attributes directly to the logging functions. These properties will be sent to Sentry, and can be searched from within the Logs UI, and even added to the Logs views as a dedicated column.

```php
$this->logger->error('Something went wrong', [
    'user_id' => $userId,
    'action' => 'update_profile',
    'additional_data' => $data,
]);
```
