Use the `Sentry.logger` API to send logs to Sentry:

```ruby
Sentry.logger.info("User logged in successfully")
Sentry.logger.error("Payment processing failed")
```

You can include additional context data as attributes:

```ruby
Sentry.logger.error(
  "Failed to process payment. Order: %{order_id}",
  order_id: "or_2342",
  amount: 99.99
)
```

Additional attributes like `amount` are sent as searchable metadata in Sentry's Logs UI.

See [Default Attributes](#default-attributes) for the complete list of metadata and [Options](#options) to customize which events are captured.
