Once the feature is enabled and the SDK is initialized, you can manually send logs using the `SentrySdk.Logger` API.

### Manual Logging

The `SentrySdk.Logger` instance exposes six methods that you can use to log messages at different log levels: `Trace`, `Debug`, `Info`, `Warning`, `Error`, and `Fatal`.

These properties will be sent to Sentry, and can be searched from within the Logs UI, and even added to the Logs views as a dedicated column.

```csharp
SentrySdk.Logger.LogInfo("A simple debug log message");
SentrySdk.Logger.LogError("A {0} log message", "formatted");
```

### Automatic Logging Integration

Because Unity's `LogType` does not match `SentryLogLevel`, the SDKs logging integration maps them as follows:

| Unity LogLevel | Sentry Logs UI Severity |
| --- | --- |
| Debug | INFO |
| Warning | WARN |
| Assert | ERROR |
| Error | ERROR |
| Fatal | FATAL |

```csharp
// Standard Unity logging - automatically captured when severity levels are enabled
Debug.Log("Player position updated.");
Debug.Warning("Low memory warning.");
Debug.Error("Failed to save game data.");
```

You can configure whether these logs are sent as:
- **Structured Logs**: Full log entries with searchable attributes
- **Breadcrumbs**: Contextual information attached to errors (useful for debugging)

<Alert level="info">
With **Structured Logs** enabled additional breadcrumb attachment to events needs to be explicitly enabled with `AddBreadcrumbsWithStructuredLogs = true`.
</Alert>

## Capture with Attributes

```csharp
SentrySdk.Logger.LogWarning(static log =>
{
    log.SetAttribute("my.attribute", "value");
}, "A log message with additional attributes.");
```

Supported attribute types are:
- Textual: `string` and `char`
- Logical: `bool`
- Integral: `sbyte`, `byte`, `short`, `ushort`, `int`, `uint`, `long` and `nint`
- Floating-point: `float` and `double`

Unsupported numeric types such as `ulong`, `nuint`, `decimal`, as well as all other types including `object`, are treated as `string` via `ToString()`.
