Once the feature is enabled on the SDK and the SDK is initialized, you can send logs using the `logger()` function.

The `logger()` function exposes six methods that you can use to log messages at different log levels: `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, and `fatal`.

You can pass additional attributes directly to the logging functions. These properties will be sent to Sentry, and can be searched from within the Logs UI, and even added to the Logs views as a dedicated column.

```php
\Sentry\logger()->info('A simple log message');
\Sentry\logger()->info('A message with a parameter that says %s', values: ['hello']);
\Sentry\logger()->warn('This is a warning log with attributes.', attributes: [
  'attribute1' => 'string',
  'attribute2' => 1,
  'attribute3' => 1.0,
  'attribute4' => true,
]);

// Somewhere at the end of your execution, you should flush the logger to send pending logs to Sentry.
\Sentry\logger()->flush();
```

If you are using logs in long running CLI tasks, we recommend periodically calling `\Sentry\logger()->flush()` to keep memory pressure low and avoid any logs being discarded to due size-limits.
