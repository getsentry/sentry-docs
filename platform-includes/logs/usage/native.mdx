Once the feature is enabled on the SDK and the SDK is initialized, you can send logs using the `sentry_log_X()` APIs.

The API exposes six methods that you can use to log messages at different log levels: `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, and `fatal`.

These properties will be sent to Sentry, and can be searched from within the Logs UI, and even added to the Logs views as a dedicated column.

```c
import io.sentry.Sentry;

sentry_log_info("A simple log message");
sentry_log_error("A %s log message", "formatted");
```
