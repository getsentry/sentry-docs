Once the feature is enabled on the SDK and the SDK is initialized, you can send logs using the `SentrySdk.Logger` APIs.

The `SentrySdk.Logger` instance exposes six methods that you can use to log messages at different log levels: `Trace`, `Debug`, `Info`, `Warning`, `Error`, and `Fatal`.

These properties will be sent to Sentry, and can be searched from within the Logs UI, and even added to the Logs views as a dedicated column.

```csharp
SentrySdk.Logger.LogInfo("A simple log message");
SentrySdk.Logger.LogError("A {0} log message", "formatted");
```

<Alert title="Note">
During the experimental phase of the feature, we will provide more method overloads for convenient invocation in common scenarios.
Additionally, we may provide method overloads that are not based on _composite format strings_, but on _interpolated strings_.

Once the feature is enabled on the SDK and the SDK is initialized, you can send logs using instances of the [ILogger](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.logging.ilogger-1) interface,
resolved through _.NET dependency injection_.

The `LoggerExtensions` extension methods expose various overloads that you can use to log messages at six different log levels automatically mapped to Sentry's severity:

| Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.LogLevel | Sentry.SentryLogLevel | Sentry Logs UI Severity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Trace | Trace | trace |
| Debug | Debug | debug |
| Information | Info | info |
| Warning | Warning | warn |
| Error | Error | error |
| Critical | Fatal | fatal |

These properties will be sent to Sentry, and can be searched from within the Logs UI, and even added to the Logs views as a dedicated column.

```csharp
public sealed class MyService(ILogger<MyService> logger)
{
    public void Invoke()
    {
        logger.LogInformation("A simple log message");
        logger.LogError("A {Parameter} log message", "formatted");
        logger.LogWarning(new EventId(1, nameof(Invoke)), "Message with EventId");
    }
}
```

The `ILogger`'s _CategoryName_, as well as the `EventId` (if provided), are attached as attributes to the logs.

For more information, see the article on [Logging in C# and .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com//dotnet/core/extensions/logging).
Sentry Structured Logs also work with [High-performance logging in .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/extensions/high-performance-logging) and [Compile-time logging source generation](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/extensions/logger-message-generator) alike.

<PlatformSection supported={["dotnet.serilog"]}>

Once the feature is enabled on the SDK and the SDK is initialized, you can send logs using the _Serilog_ APIs.

The static `Log` and instance `Logger` types expose various methods that you can use to log messages at six different log levels automatically mapped to Sentry's severity:

| Serilog.Events.LogEventLevel | Sentry.SentryLogLevel | Sentry Logs UI Severity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Verbose | Trace | trace |
| Debug | Debug | debug |
| Information | Info | info |
| Warning | Warning | warn |
| Error | Error | error |
| Fatal | Fatal | fatal |

These properties will be sent to Sentry, and can be searched from within the Logs UI, and even added to the Logs views as a dedicated column.

```csharp
using (LogContext.PushProperty("Version", 5150))
{
    Log.Information("A simple log message");
    Log.Error("A {Parameter} log message", "formatted");
    Log.ForContext("Property", "Value").Warning("Message with Property");
}
```

The _Enrichments_ of _log events_ are attached as attributes to the logs, alongside a set of default attributes automatically provided by the SDK.

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection notSupported={["dotnet.aspnetcore", "dotnet.azure-functions-worker", "dotnet.blazor-webassembly", "dotnet.extensions-logging", "dotnet.maui", "dotnet.serilog"]}>

The SDK automatically provides a set of default attributes attached to your logs.
Additionally, you can attach custom attributes via a delegate.

```csharp
SentrySdk.Logger.LogWarning(static log =>
{
    log.SetAttribute("my.attribute", "value");
}, "A log message with additional attributes.");
```

Supported attribute types are:
- Textual: `string` and `char`
- Logical: `bool`
- Integral: `sbyte`, `byte`, `short`, `ushort`, `int`, `uint`, `long` and `nint`
- Floating-point: `float` and `double`

Unsupported numeric types such as `ulong`, `nuint`, `decimal`, as well as all other types including `object`, are treated as `string` via `ToString()`.
