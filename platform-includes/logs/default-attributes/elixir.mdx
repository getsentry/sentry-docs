The Elixir SDK automatically sets several default attributes on all log entries to provide context and improve debugging:

<Include name="logs/default-attributes/core" />

<Include name="logs/default-attributes/message-template" />

<Include name="logs/default-attributes/server" />

### OpenTelemetry Attributes

If you're using OpenTelemetry with the `opentelemetry_logger_metadata` package, the following attributes are automatically included:

- `trace_id`: The OpenTelemetry trace ID associated with the log event.
- `span_id`: The OpenTelemetry span ID associated with the log event.

If no OpenTelemetry context is available, a random trace ID is generated to allow log correlation within Sentry.
