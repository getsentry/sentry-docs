#### beforeSendLog

To filter logs, or update them before they are sent to Sentry, you can use the `_experiments.beforeSendLog` option.

```js
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  _experiments: {
    enableLogs: true,
    beforeSendLog: (log) => {
      if (log.level === "info") {
        // Filter out all info logs
        return null;
      }

      return log;
    },
  },
});
```

The `beforeSendLog` function receives a log object, and should return the log object if you want it to be sent to Sentry, or `null` if you want to discard it.

The log object has the following properties:

- `level`: (string - one of `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`) The log level.
- `message`: (string) The message to be logged.
- `timestamp`: (number) The timestamp of the log.
- `attributes`: (object) The attributes of the log.
