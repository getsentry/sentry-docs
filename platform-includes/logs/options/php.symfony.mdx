#### before_send_log

To filter logs, or update them before they are sent to Sentry, you can use the `before_send_log` option.

```yaml {filename:config/packages/sentry.yaml}
sentry:
  options:
    before_send_log: "sentry.callback.before_send_log"

services:
    sentry.callback.before_send_log:
        class: 'App\Service\Sentry'
        factory: ['@App\Service\Sentry', 'getBeforeSendLog']
```

The service needed for the `before_send_log` option can be implemented as follows:

```php {filename:src/Service/Sentry.php}
<?php

namespace App\Service;

class Sentry
{
    public function getBeforeSendLog(): callable
    {
        return function (\Sentry\Logs\Log $log): ?\Sentry\Logs\Log {
            if ($log->getLevel() === \Sentry\Logs\LogLevel::info()) {
                // Filter out all info logs
                return null;
            }

            return $log;
        };
    }
}
```

</Alert>

The `before_send_log` function receives a log object, and should return the log object if you want it to be sent to Sentry, or `null` if you want to discard it.
