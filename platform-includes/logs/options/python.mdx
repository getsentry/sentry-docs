#### before_send_log

To filter logs, or update them before they are sent to Sentry, you can use the `before_send_log` option.

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.types import Log, Hint
from typing import Optional

def before_log(log: Log, _hint: Hint) -> Optional[Log]:
    # Filter out all info level logs
    if log["severity_text"] == "info":
        return None
    return log

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    enable_logs=True,
    before_send_log=before_log,
)
```

The `before_send_log` function receives a log object, and should return the log object if you want it to be sent to Sentry, or `None` if you want to discard it.

The log dict has the following keys:

- `severity_text`: (`str` - one of `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, `fatal`) The log level.
- `severity_number`: (`int`) The log level as a number ranging from 1 to 24, as per the OpenTelemetry specification of [`SeverityNumber`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/logs/data-model/#field-severitynumber).
- `body`: (`str`) The log message.
- `attributes`: (`dict[str, str | bool | float | int]`) Additional attributes to be sent with the log.
- `time_unix_nano`: (`int`) The timestamp of the log in nanoseconds since the Unix epoch.
- `trace_id`: (`Optional[str]`) The trace ID of the trace this log belongs to.
