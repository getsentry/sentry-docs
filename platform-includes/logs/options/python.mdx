#### before_send_log

To filter logs, or update them before they are sent to Sentry, you can use the `_experiments.before_send_log` option.

```python
def _before_log(log):
    if log.level == "info":
        # Filter out all info logs
        return None

    return log

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    _experiments={
        "enable_logs": True,
        "before_send_log": _before_log,
    },
)
```

The `before_send_log` function receives a log object, and should return the log object if you want it to be sent to Sentry, or `None` if you want to discard it.

The log object has the following properties:

- `level`: (string - one of `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`) The log level.
- `message`: (string) The message to be logged.
- `timestamp`: (number) The timestamp of the log.
- `attributes`: (object) The attributes of the log.
