#### beforeSendLog

To filter logs, or update them before they are sent to Sentry, you can use the `beforeSendLog` option.

```dart
await SentryFlutter.init(
  (options) {
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    options.beforeSendLog = (log) {
      if (log.level == SentryLogLevel.info) {
        // Filter out all info logs
        return null;
      }

      return log;
    };
  },
);
```

The `beforeSend` function receives a log object, and should return the log object if you want it to be sent to Sentry, or `null` if you want to discard it.
