### before_send_log

To filter or modify logs before they are sent to Sentry, use the `before_send_log` callback. Return `false` to skip a log, or return the log event to send it.

### LoggerHandler Options

When configuring `Sentry.LoggerHandler`, you can use these options specific to logs:

- **`:logs_level`** - The minimum log level to send to Sentry's Logs Protocol. If `nil` (default), logs sending is disabled. Set to `:debug`, `:info`, `:notice`, `:warning`, `:error`, `:critical`, `:alert`, or `:emergency`.

- **`:logs_excluded_domains`** - A list of logger domains to exclude from logs sending. The `:sentry` domain is always excluded automatically.

- **`:logs_metadata`** - Logger metadata keys to include as attributes in log events. Set to `:all` to include all metadata, or a list of specific keys like `[:request_id, :user_id]`.

### Global Configuration Options

These options are set in your Sentry configuration (`config :sentry`):

- **`:enable_logs`** - Set to `true` to enable the logs feature. Default is `false`.

- **`:max_log_events`** - The maximum number of log events to buffer before flushing to Sentry. Default is `100`. Logs are also flushed every 5 seconds.

```elixir
config :sentry,
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  enable_logs: true,
  max_log_events: 50,
  before_send_log: {MyApp.Sentry, :before_send_log}
```
