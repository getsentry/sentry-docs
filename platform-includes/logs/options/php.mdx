#### before_send_log

To filter logs, or update them before they are sent to Sentry, you can use the `before_send_log` option.

```php
\Sentry\init([
    'dsn' => '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
    // Enable logs to be sent to Sentry
    'enable_logs' => true,
    'before_send_log' => function (\Sentry\Logs\Log $log): ?\Sentry\Logs\Log {
        if ($log->getLevel() === \Sentry\Logs\LogLevel::info()) {
            // Filter out all info logs
            return null;
        }

        return $log;
    },
]);
```

The `before_send_log` function receives a log object, and should return the log object if you want it to be sent to Sentry, or `null` if you want to discard it.
