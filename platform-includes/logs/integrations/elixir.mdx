Logs are sent to Sentry through Erlang's `:logger` system via `Sentry.LoggerHandler`. This means any logs from your application or libraries that use Elixir's `Logger` or Erlang's `:logger` will be captured and sent to Sentry (at or above the configured `:logs_level`).

```elixir
# In your application's start/2 callback
:logger.add_handler(:sentry_handler, Sentry.LoggerHandler, %{
  config: %{
    logs_level: :info,
    logs_metadata: [:request_id, :user_id]
  }
})
```

Then all logs at the configured level will be sent to Sentry:

```elixir
require Logger

Logger.debug("Debug message")  # Not sent (below :info level)
Logger.info("Info message")    # Sent to Sentry
Logger.warning("Warning")      # Sent to Sentry
Logger.error("Error occurred") # Sent to Sentry
```

### Excluding Domains

You can exclude specific logger domains from being sent to Sentry using the `:logs_excluded_domains` option:

```elixir
config: %{
  logs_level: :info,
  logs_excluded_domains: [:ecto, :phoenix]
}
```

<Alert level="info" title="Logs vs Error Reporting">
  The logs feature (controlled by `:logs_level`) is separate from error
  reporting (controlled by `:level`). Error reporting captures crash reports and
  exceptions, while logs captures structured log events. You can configure both
  independently.
