Logs are sent to Sentry through Erlang's `:logger` system via `Sentry.LoggerHandler`. When `enable_logs: true` is set in your Sentry configuration, the SDK automatically attaches the handler — no manual setup is needed. Any logs from your application or libraries that use Elixir's `Logger` or Erlang's `:logger` will be captured and sent to Sentry at or above the configured level.

The logs behavior is configured globally via the `:logs` key — not through the handler config map:

```elixir
config :sentry,
  enable_logs: true,
  logs: [
    level: :info,
    metadata: [:request_id, :user_id]
  ]
```

With this configuration, logs at or above `:info` will be sent to Sentry:

```elixir
require Logger

Logger.debug("Debug message")  # Not sent (below :info level)
Logger.info("Info message")    # Sent to Sentry
Logger.warning("Warning")      # Sent to Sentry
Logger.error("Error occurred") # Sent to Sentry
```

### Excluding Domains

You can exclude specific logger domains from being sent to Sentry using the `:excluded_domains` option under `:logs`:

```elixir
config :sentry,
  enable_logs: true,
  logs: [
    level: :info,
    excluded_domains: [:ecto, :phoenix]
  ]
```

<Alert level="info" title="Logs vs Error Reporting">
  The logs feature (configured under `:logs`) is separate from error
  reporting (configured via `Sentry.LoggerHandler`'s `:level` option). Error reporting captures crash reports and
  exceptions, while logs captures structured log events. You can configure both
  independently.
