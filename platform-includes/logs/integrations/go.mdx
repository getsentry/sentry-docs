### `io.Writer` interface

The `sentry.Logger` implements the `io.Writer` interface, so you can easily inject the logger into your existing setup. However, to correctly
link your traces you would need to create a new logger everytime you want to pass a new context. Due to this limitation we recommend using the
`sentry.Logger` or any of the other supported integrations.

```go
sentryLogger := sentry.NewLogger(ctx)
logger := log.New(sentryLogger, "", log.LstdFlags)
logger.Println("Implementing log.Logger")
```
