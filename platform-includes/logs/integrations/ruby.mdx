To enable logging for all loggers that use Ruby [Logger](https://ruby-doc.org/3.4.1/stdlibs/logger/Logger.html) you can enable `:logger` patch:

```ruby
Sentry.init do |config|
  config.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
  config.enable_logs = true
  config.enabled_patches = [:logger]
end
```

Then all logs from `Logger` instances will be sent to Sentry, for example:

```ruby
logger = Logger.new($stdout)

logger.debug("Hello from stdlib logger")
logger.info("Hello from stdlib logger")
logger.error("Hello from stdlib logger")
```

<Alert level="info" title="Note on structured logging">
Ruby's stdlib logger does not support structured logging, that's why logs are sent to Sentry as plain messages with default attributes added automatically by the SDK.
</Alert>

## Ruby on Rails

If you enable `:logger` patch like explained above, this will affect Rails' built-in logger. This means that anything that Rails logs, and any custom usage of the Rails logger, will result in sending log entries to Sentry, for example:

```ruby
# All these calls will result in log entries in Sentry
# if :logger patch is enabled
Rails.logger.debug("Hello from Rails logger")
Rails.logger.info("Hello from Rails logger")
Rails.logger.error("Hello from Rails logger")
```
