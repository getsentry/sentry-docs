You can call `captureRequestError` with all arguments passed to `onRequestError`:

```TypeScript {filename:instrumentation.ts}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";
import type { Instrumentation } from "next";

export const onRequestError: Instrumentation.onRequestError = (...args) => {
    Sentry.captureRequestError(...args);

    // ... additional logic here
};
```

```JavaScript {filename:instrumentation.js}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

export const onRequestError = (...args) => {
    Sentry.captureRequestError(...args);

    // ... additional logic here
};
```
