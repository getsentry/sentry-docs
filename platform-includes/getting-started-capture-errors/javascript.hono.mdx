### Report Unhandled Exceptions

By default, Sentry reports exceptions reported by the `onError` function from Hono. In case the error comes with a status code, it captures all errors except for the ones with a 3xx or 4xx status code.

To learn how to customize this behavior, see the [`honoIntegration` documentation](/platforms/javascript/guides/cloudflare/configuration/integrations/hono/).
