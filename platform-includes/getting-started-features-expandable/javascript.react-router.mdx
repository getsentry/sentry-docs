- [**Issues**](/product/issues) (always enabled): Sentry's core error monitoring product that automatically reports errors,
  uncaught exceptions, and unhandled rejections. If you have something that
  looks like an exception, Sentry can capture it.
- [**Tracing**](/product/tracing): Track software performance while seeing the
  impact of errors across multiple systems. For example, distributed tracing
  allows you to follow a request from the frontend to the backend and back.
- [**Session Replay**](/product/explore/session-replay/web):
  Get to the root cause of an issue faster by viewing a video-like reproduction
  of what was happening in the user's browser before, during, and after the
  problem.
- [**Profiling**](/product/explore/profiling/): Gain deeper insight than traditional tracing without custom instrumentation, letting you discover slow-to-execute or resource-intensive functions in your app.
- [**Logs**](/product/explore/logs): Centralize and analyze your application logs to
  correlate them with errors and performance issues. Search, filter, and
  visualize log data to understand what's happening in your applications.
