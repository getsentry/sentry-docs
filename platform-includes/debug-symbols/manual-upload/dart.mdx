## iOS and macOS

Sentry requires a dSYM upload to symbolicate your crash logs. The symbolication process unscrambles Apple's crash logs to reveal the function, file names, and line numbers of the crash.

## Android

For Android applications, you need to upload mapping files manually with the Sentry CLI.

## Android NDK

For native code crashes in Android applications, you need to upload ELF DWARF debug files.

If you're using a version of `sentry_flutter` earlier than 5.1, native symbolication on Android requires a specific configuration. Refer to [Troubleshooting](/platforms/dart/guides/flutter/troubleshooting/#native-symbolication-on-android) for more information.

<Alert>

Sentry's Flutter SDK doesn't currently support the `uploadNativeSymbols` flag from the [Sentry Gradle Plugin](/platforms/android/configuration/gradle/).

## Web

For web applications, you need to upload source maps to get readable stack traces.
