## Prerequisites

You need:

- A Sentry [account](https://sentry.io/signup/) and [project](/product/projects/)
- Your application up and running
- Node version `18.0.0` or above (>= `19.9.0` or `18.19.0`  recommended)

<Expandable title="Are you using Node version < 18.19.0 or < 19.9.0?">
  The required Node version will increase in the next major release of the SDK (v11) to support features that rely on [`TracingChannel`](https://nodejs.org/api/diagnostics_channel.html#class-tracingchannel).

  - We strongly recommend upgrading to at least Node `18.19.0` or `19.9.0` to get the best support.
  - While we may add features relying on `TracingChannel` in v10.x releases, they will have backwards compatibility for older Node versions.

  See the following [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/17585) for more details.
