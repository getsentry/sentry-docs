## Prerequisites

You need:

- A Sentry [account](https://sentry.io/signup/) and [project](/product/projects/)
- Your application up and running
- SvelteKit version `2.0.0`+
- Vite version `4.2`+

<Expandable title="Notes on SvelteKit adapter compatibility">
The SvelteKit Sentry SDK is designed to work out of the box with several SvelteKit adapters and their underlying server runtimes.
Here's an overview of the current support:

- **Fully supported Node.js runtimes**
  - [Adapter-auto](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-auto) for Vercel; other Node.js-based platforms might work, but we don't guarantee compatibility at this time
  - [Adapter-vercel](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-vercel) when used with Vercel's Node.js Lambda runtime
  - [Adapter-node](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-node)
- **Supported non-Node.js runtimes**
  - [Adapter-cloudflare](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-cloudflare) requires [additional setup](/platforms/javascript/guides/cloudflare/frameworks/sveltekit/)
- **Currently not supported**
  - Non-Node.js server runtimes, such as Vercel's edge runtime, are not yet supported.
- **Other adapters**
  - Other SvelteKit adapters might work, but they're not currently officially supported. We're looking into extending first-class support to more adapters in the future.
