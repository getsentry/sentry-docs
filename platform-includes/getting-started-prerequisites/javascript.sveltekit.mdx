## Prerequisites

You need:

- A Sentry [account](https://sentry.io/signup/) and [project](/product/projects/)
- Your application up and running
- SvelteKit version `2.0.0`+ (we recommend `2.31.0` or higher for best support)
- Vite version `4.2`+

<Expandable title="I'm on an older SvelteKit version than 2.31.0">

Version `2.31.0` of SvelteKit introduces [official support for observability and tracing](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/observability). 
This means that Sentry can now follow the official best practice for how the SDK should be set up:

- The Sentry SDK will be initialized at the correct, earliest possible time on the server, allowing for all its auto-instrumentation to work correctly. 
  This means, you will now get spans from auto instrumentation (e.g. database queries) automatically. 
- The Sentry SDK picks up spans emitted from SvelteKit directly. 
  You'll get more accurate insights into the performance of your handlers, server actions, `load`, and remote functions.

SvelteKit observability is still an experimental feature in SvelteKit 2.x, but we recommend giving it a try.
The Sentry wizard, as well as this guide, will use it as the default way of setting up the SDK.

If you've already set up the SDK and don't want to migrate to the new setup, or don't want to upgrade to SvelteKit `2.31.0` or higher, that's fine too. 
Just follow <PlatformLink to="/manual-setup__v10.7.0">this guide</PlatformLink> instead. 
However, note that auto instrumentation (e.g. for database queries) will not work.

<Expandable title="Notes on SvelteKit adapter compatibility">
The SvelteKit Sentry SDK is designed to work out of the box with several SvelteKit adapters and their underlying server runtimes.
Here's an overview of the current support:

- **Fully supported Node.js runtimes**
  - [Adapter-auto](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-auto) for Vercel; other Node.js-based platforms might work, but we don't guarantee compatibility at this time
  - [Adapter-vercel](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-vercel) when used with Vercel's Node.js Lambda runtime
  - [Adapter-node](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-node)
- **Supported non-Node.js runtimes**
  - [Adapter-cloudflare](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-cloudflare) requires [additional setup](/platforms/javascript/guides/cloudflare/frameworks/sveltekit/)
- **Currently not supported**
  - Non-Node.js server runtimes, such as Vercel's edge runtime, are not yet supported.
- **Other adapters**
  - Other SvelteKit adapters might work, but they're not currently officially supported. We're looking into extending first-class support to more adapters in the future.
