## Prerequisites

You need:

- A Sentry [account](https://sentry.io/signup/) and [project](/product/projects/)
- Your application up and running
- SvelteKit version `2.0.0`+
- Vite version `4.2`+

<Expandable title="Notes on SvelteKit adapter compatibility">
The SvelteKit Sentry SDK is designed to work out of the box with the following SvelteKit adapters:

- [Adapter-auto](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-auto) – for Vercel; other platforms might work but we don't guarantee compatibility at this time
- [Adapter-vercel](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-vercel) – only for Node (Lambda) runtimes, not yet Vercel's edge runtime
- [Adapter-cloudflare](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-cloudflare) – supported but requires [additional setup](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/cloudflare/frameworks/sveltekit/)
- [Adapter-node](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-node)

Other adapters may work but aren't currently supported. We're looking into extending first-class support to more adapters in the future.

Also, Sentry's SvelteKit SDK does not yet work with all non-node server runtimes, such as Vercel's edge runtime.
