### Cache Components Limitations

If you're using Next.js [Cache Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/cache-components), you may encounter errors like:

```
Accessing random cryptographic values synchronously in a Server Component requires reading one of these data sources first...
```

#### Turbopack with `generateMetadata`

Using `generateMetadata` in page components with Turbopack and the Sentry SDK is currently not supported. ([Tracking issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/18392))

**Workarounds:**

- Remove `generateMetadata` from affected page components
- Disable server-side tracing by removing or renaming your `instrumentation.ts` file

#### Webpack with Cache Components

Cache Components are not supported when using webpack. ([Tracking issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/18340))

**Workarounds:**

- Switch to Turbopack (note the `generateMetadata` limitation above)
- Disable server-side tracing by removing or renaming your `instrumentation.ts` file
