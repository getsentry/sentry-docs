The Django integration adds the WSGI request [`environ` object](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/#environ-variables):

```python
{
  # This can be useful for cases in which the transaction starts before the URL
  # is resolved into a route (meaning the transaction's name won't help much),
  # as it contains parsed URL data
  "wsgi_environ": <dict>
}
```
