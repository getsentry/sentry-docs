For the Python SDK, it includes at least the following:

```python
{
    "transaction_context": {
        "name": <string>  # transaction title at creation time
        "op": <string>  # short description of transaction type, like "http.request"
    },
    "parent_sampled": <bool>  # if this transaction has a parent, its sampling decision
    ...  # other attributes as passed to `start_span`
}
```
