For node-based SDKs, it includes at least the following:

```typescript
{
  // human-readable identifier, like "GET /users"
  name: string; 
  // if this transaction has a parent, its sampling decision
  parentSampled: boolean;
  // The initial attributes passed to the span
  attributes: Record<string, string | number | boolean>; 
}
```
