For the native SDK, it includes a [Transaction Context](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-native/blob/5cb09867668a2b1d09a13a2a13253a83127a31d9/src/sentry_tracing.c), a custom sampling context (`sentry_value_t` which can be used to store 'char *' keys with `sentry_value_t` values (from `int32`, `bool`, `double` or `char *`)) and a `parent_sampled` flag (`int *`) indicating whether there was a sampling decision in the transaction's parent (if it is `NULL`, there is no decision. Pointing to `0`Â indicates it wasn't sampled, and to a `1` means it was).
