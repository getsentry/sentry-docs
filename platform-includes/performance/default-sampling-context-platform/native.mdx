For the native SDK, it includes 
* a [Transaction Context](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-native/blob/5cb09867668a2b1d09a13a2a13253a83127a31d9/src/sentry_tracing.c), 
* a custom sampling context (a `sentry_value_t` of arbitrary structure) and
* a `parent_sampled` flag (`int*`) indicating there wasn't a sampling decision in the transaction's parent if it is `NULL`.  If the pointer isn't `NULL`, a value of `0`Â indicates the parent wasn't sampled, and a `1` means it was.
