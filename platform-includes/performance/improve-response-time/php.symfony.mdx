If your web server is using FastCGI, our SDK utilizes the [kernel.terminate event](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/http_kernel.html#8-the-kernel-terminate-event), which means the response is sent to the user before the performance data is sent to Sentry.

If your web server isn't using FastCGI, you can run [Relay](/product/relay/getting-started/) locally on the same machine or a local network that can act as a proxy/agent.
