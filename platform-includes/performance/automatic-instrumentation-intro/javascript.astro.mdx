The Sentry Astro SDK provides a `BrowserTracing` integration to add automatic instrumentation for monitoring the performance of browser applications, which is enabled by default.
The SDK also automatically enables tracing in your server-side code.

<Expandable title="Are you using Astro version <3.5.2?">

For Astro versions below `3.5.2`, you need to manually add the Sentry middleware to your `src/middleware.(ts|js)` file:

```javascript {filename:src/middleware.(js|ts)}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/astro";
import { sequence } from "astro:middleware";

export const onRequest = sequence(
  Sentry.handleRequest()
  // other middleware handlers
);
```

If you have multiple request handlers, make sure to add the Sentry middleware as the first handler in the sequence.
