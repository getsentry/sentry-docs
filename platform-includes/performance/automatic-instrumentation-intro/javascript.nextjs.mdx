`@sentry/nextjs` provides a `BrowserTracing` integration to add automatic instrumentation for monitoring the performance of browser applications, which is enabled by default once you set up tracing in your app.
Further, the SDK will automatically enable error collection and tracing in your API routes and [Next.js Data Fetchers](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/overview).
