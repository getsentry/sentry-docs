Adding custom measurements is supported in Sentry's Python SDK version `1.16.0` and above. To enable the capturing of custom measurements before `1.16.0`, you'll need to enable the `custom_measurements` experimental option.

```python
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    # ...
    _experiments={
        "custom_measurements": True,  # for SDK versions before 1.16.0
    },
)

# Record amount of memory used
sentry_sdk.set_measurement('memory_used', 123, 'byte')

# Record time when job was started
sentry_sdk.set_measurement('job_start_time', 1.3, 'second')

# Record amount of times cache was read
sentry_sdk.set_measurement('cache_read_count', 4)
```
