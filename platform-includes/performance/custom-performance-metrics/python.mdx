Adding custom measurements is supported in Sentry's Python SDK version `1.16.0` and above.


```python
sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
)
```

To capture in the SDK:

```python
from sentry_sdk import set_measurement

# Record amount of memory used
set_measurement('memory_used', 123, 'byte')

# Record time when job was started
set_measurement('job_start_time', 1.3, 'second')

# Record amount of times cache was read
set_measurement('cache_read_count', 4)
```

The feature was marked experimental between versions `1.5.12` and `1.16.0`.
To enable the capturing of custom measurements before `1.16.0`, you'll need to enable the `custom_measurements` experiment option
and fetch the transaction manually.


```python
sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    _experiments={
        "custom_measurements": True,  # for versions before 1.16.0
    },
)


transaction = Hub.current.scope.transaction

if transaction:
    transaction.set_measurement('memory_used', 123, 'byte')
```
