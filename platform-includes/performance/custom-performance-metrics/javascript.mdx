Adding custom measurements is supported in Sentry's JavaScript SDK version `7.0.0` and above.

```javascript
// Record amount of memory used
Sentry.setMeasurement("memoryUsed", 123, "byte");

// Record time when Footer component renders on page
Sentry.setMeasurement("ui.footerComponent.render", 1.3, "second");

// Record amount of times localStorage was read
Sentry.setMeasurement("localStorageRead", 4);
```
