Adding custom measurements is supported in Sentry's .NET SDK, version `3.23.0` and above.

The following example shows how to set custom measurements on a `transaction`, including how obtain the current `span` and get its `transaction`.
If you already have the `transaction` or `span`, you can use it directly.

```csharp
var span = SentrySdk.GetSpan();  // or hub.GetSpan()
if (span != null)
{
    var transaction = span.GetTransaction();

    // Record amount of memory used
    transaction.SetMeasurement("memory_used", 64, MeasurementUnit.Information.Megabyte);

    // Record time it took to load user profile
    transaction.SetMeasurement("user_profile_loading_time", 1.3, MeasurementUnit.Duration.Second);

    // Record number of times the screen was loaded
    transaction.SetMeasurement("screen_load_count", 4);
}
```
