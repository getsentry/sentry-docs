The following example shows how to set custom measurements on a `transaction`, including how obtain the current `span` and get its `transaction`.
If you already have the `transaction` or `span`, you can use it directly.

```powershell
# Record amount of memory used
[Sentry.SpanDataExtensions]::SetMeasurement($transaction, 'memory_used', 64, [Sentry.MeasurementUnit+Information]::Megabyte)

# Record time it took to load user profile
[Sentry.SpanDataExtensions]::SetMeasurement($transaction, 'user_profile_loading_time', 1.3, [Sentry.MeasurementUnit+Duration]::Second)

# Record number of times the screen was loaded
[Sentry.SpanDataExtensions]::SetMeasurement($transaction, 'screen_load_count', 4)
```
