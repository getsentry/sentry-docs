Adding custom measurements is supported in `sentry-ruby` version `5.8.0` and above.

```ruby
transaction = Sentry.get_current_scope.get_transaction

# Record amount of memory used
transaction.set_measurement('memory_used', 123, 'byte')

# Record time when job was started
transaction.set_measurement('job_start_time', 1.3, 'second')

# Record amount of times cache was read
transaction.set_measurement('cache_read_count', 4)
```
