Adding custom measurements is supported in Sentry's React Native SDK version `4.0.0` and above.

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react-native";

const transaction = Sentry.getCurrentScope().getTransaction();

// Record amount of memory used
transaction.setMeasurement("memoryUsed", 123, "byte");

// Record time when Footer component renders on page
transaction.setMeasurement("ui.footerComponent.render", 1.3, "second");

// Record amount of times localStorage was read
transaction.setMeasurement("localStorageRead", 4);
```
