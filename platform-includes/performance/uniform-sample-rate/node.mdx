To do this, set the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> option in your `Sentry.init()` to a number between 0 and 1. With this option set, every transaction created will have that percentage chance of being sent to Sentry. (So, for example, if you set <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> to `0.2`, approximately 20% of your transactions will get recorded and sent.) That looks like this:

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/traces-sample-rate" />
