For example:

- A frontend application is served from `example.com`
- A backend service is served from `api.example.com`
- The frontend application makes API calls to the backend
- The option can be configured for the built-in ember browser tracing: `browserTracingOptions: { tracePropagationTargets: ['api.example.com'] }}`
- Now outgoing XHR/fetch requests to `api.example.com` will get the `sentry-trace` header attached.


```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/ember";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,

  browserTracingOptions: {
    tracePropagationTargets: [
      "localhost",
      "my-site-url.com",
      "api.example.com",
    ],
  },
});
```
