To use the sampling function, set the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> option in your SDK configuration to a function that will accept a <PlatformIdentifier name="sampling-context" /> dictionary and return a sample rate between 0 and 1. For example:

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/traces-sampler-as-sampler" />

<Alert level="info">

Currently there's no support for sampling functions on Windows/Linux (<PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" />).

</Alert>

Additionally, your sampling function may also return `false`, which indicates that no sampling decision has been made. In such case, the trace will retain the previous decision if it has been made (for example if it was started from an incoming trace header), or fall back to the value configured in <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" />.
