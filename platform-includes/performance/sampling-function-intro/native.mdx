To use the sampling function, set the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> option to a function that will accept a `sentry_transaction_context_t *`, a `custom_sampling_ctx` and an `int *` for the transaction's parent sampling decision. This function should return a sample rate between 0 and 1. For example:

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/traces-sampler-as-sampler" />
