To use the sampling function, set the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> option in your `SentryAndroid.init()` to a function that will accept a <PlatformIdentifier name="sampling-context" /> dictionary and return a sample rate between 0 and 1. You should return the parent sampling decision if there is one. You may also return `null` and let the Java SDK make the decision as if no <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> was set. For example:

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/traces-sampler-as-sampler" />
