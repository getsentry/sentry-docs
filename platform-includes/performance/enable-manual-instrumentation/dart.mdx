To instrument certain regions of your code, you can create transactions to capture them.

The following example creates a transaction that contains an expensive operation (for example, `processOrderBatch`), and sends the result to Sentry:

```dart
import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';

final transaction = Sentry.startTransaction('processOrderBatch()', 'task');

try {
  processOrderBatch();
} catch (exception) {
  transaction.throwable = exception;
  transaction.status = SpanStatus.internalError();
} finally {
  await transaction.finish();
}
```
