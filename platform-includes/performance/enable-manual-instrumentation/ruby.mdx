To instrument certain regions of your code, you can create transactions to capture them.

The following example creates a transaction for a scope that contains an expensive operation (for example, `process_item`), and sends the result to Sentry:

```ruby
# start a transaction
transaction = Sentry.start_transaction(op: "process_item")

# set the transaction on the scope so children span are attached to this transaction
Sentry.get_current_scope.set_span(transaction)

# perform the operation
process_item(args)


# finish the transaction, which will send it to Sentry automatically
transaction.finish
```
