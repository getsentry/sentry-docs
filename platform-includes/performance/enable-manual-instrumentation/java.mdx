To instrument certain regions of your code, you can create transactions to capture them.

The following example creates a transaction that contains an expensive operation (for example, `processOrderBatch`), and sends the result to Sentry:

```java {tabTitle:Java}
import io.sentry.ITransaction;
import io.sentry.Sentry;
import io.sentry.SpanStatus;

// A good name for the transaction is key, to help identify what this is about
ITransaction transaction = Sentry.startTransaction("processOrderBatch()", "task");
try {
  processOrderBatch();
} catch (Exception e) {
  transaction.setThrowable(e);
  transaction.setStatus(SpanStatus.INTERNAL_ERROR);
  throw e;
} finally {
  transaction.finish();
}
```

```kotlin {tabTitle:Kotlin}
import io.sentry.Sentry
import io.sentry.SpanStatus

// A good name for the transaction is key, to help identify what this is about
val transaction = Sentry.startTransaction("processOrderBatch()", "task")
try {
  processOrderBatch()
} catch (e: Exception) {
  transaction.throwable = e
  transaction.status = SpanStatus.INTERNAL_ERROR
  throw e
} finally {
  transaction.finish();
}
```

By default the transaction is not bound to the scope. Our auto instrumentation, for example those instrumenting database requests or HTTP calls, rely on a transaction to be present in order to attach new child spans to it. Please take a look at the <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation/#create-transaction-bound-to-the-current-scope">Create Transaction Bound to The Current Scope</PlatformLink> section further down.
