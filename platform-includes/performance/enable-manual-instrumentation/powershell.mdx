To instrument certain regions of your code, you can create transactions to capture them.

```powershell
# Transaction can be started by providing, at minimum, the name and the operation
$transaction = Start-SentryTransaction 'test-transaction-name' 'test-transaction-operation'

# ...
# (Perform the operation represented by the span/transaction)
# ...

$transaction.Finish() # Mark the transaction as finished and send it to Sentry
```
