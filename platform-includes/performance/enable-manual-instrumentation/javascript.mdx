To instrument certain regions of your code, you can create spans to capture them.

This is valid for all JavaScript SDKs (both backend and frontend) and works independently of the `Express`, `Http`, and `BrowserTracing` integrations.

```javascript
Sentry.startSpan({ name: "test-transaction" }, (rootSpan) => {
    Sentry.startSpan({ name: "child-span", op: "functionX" }, (childSpan) => {
       // do something in here
       // childSpan will be nested inside of rootSpan
    });
});
```
