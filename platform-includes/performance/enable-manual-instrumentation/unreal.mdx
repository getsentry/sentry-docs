To instrument certain parts of your code, you can create transactions to capture them.

```cpp
USentrySubsystem* SentrySubsystem = GEngine->GetEngineSubsystem<USentrySubsystem>();

// Transactions can be started by providing the name and the operation
USentryTransaction* transaction = SentrySubsystem->StartTransaction(
    TEXT("transaction name"),
    TEXT("transaction operation")
);

// Transactions can have child spans (and those spans can have child spans as well)
USentrySpan* span = transaction->StartChild(
    TEXT("span name"),
    TEXT("span description")
);

// ...
// (Perform the operation represented by the span/transaction)
// ...

span->Finish();
transaction->Finish();
```
