To instrument certain regions of your code, you can create transactions to capture them.

```c
// Enable tracing by setting a sample rate above 0
sentry_options_t *options = sentry_options_new();
sentry_options_set_traces_sample_rate(options, 0.2);
// ...
// (Configure tracing unrelated options as you see fit)
// ...
sentry_init(options);

// Transactions can be started by providing the name and the operation
sentry_transaction_context_t *tx_ctx = sentry_transaction_context_new(
    "transaction name",
    "transaction operation"
);
sentry_transaction_t *tx = sentry_transaction_start(tx_ctx, sentry_value_new_null());

// Transactions can have child spans (and those spans can have child spans as well)
sentry_span_t *span = sentry_transaction_start_child(
    tx,
    "child operation",
    "child description"
);

// ...
// (Perform the operation represented by the span/transaction)
// ...

sentry_span_finish(span); // Mark the span as finished
sentry_transaction_finish(tx); // Mark the transaction as finished and send it to Sentry
```
