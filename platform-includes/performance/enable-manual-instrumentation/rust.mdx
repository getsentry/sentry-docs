To instrument certain regions of your code, you can create transactions to capture them.

```rust
// Transaction can be started by providing the name and the operation
let tx_ctx = sentry::TransactionContext::new(
    "transaction name",
    "transaction operation",
);
let transaction = sentry::start_transaction(tx_ctx);

// Transactions can have child spans, and those spans can have child spans as well.
let span = transaction.start_child("span operation", "span description");

// ...
// Perform your operations
// ...

span.finish(); // Remember that only finished spans will be sent with the transaction
transaction.finish(); // Finishing the transaction will send it to Sentry
```
