<SdkOption name="traces_sampler" type='function' defaultValue='None'>

A function responsible for determining the percentage chance a given transaction will be sent to Sentry. This configuration option accepts a function, which takes one parameter (the `sampling_context`). The given `sampling_context` contains information about the transaction and the context in which it's being created. The function must return a number between `0` (0% chance of being sent) and `1` (100% chance of being sent). Can also be used for filtering transactions, by returning `0` for those that are unwanted.

Either this or `traces_sample_rate` must be defined to enable tracing.
