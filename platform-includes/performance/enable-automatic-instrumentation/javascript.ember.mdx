The Ember add-on automatically adds the tracing integration for you with additional routing details by hooking into your application's router. If you are not seeing transactions appear, you may need change the configuration passed to Ember's default tracing integration. The options for the default integration can be passed by using `browserTracingOptions`.

After configuration, you will see both `pageload` and `navigation` transactions in sentry.io.

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/ember";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,

  // Configuration for Ember's default tracing integration.
  browserTracingOptions: {
    tracePropagationTargets: ["localhost", "my-site-url.com", /^\//],
  },
});
```
