To enable tracing, include the `BrowserTracing` integration in your SDK configuration options.

After configuration, you'll see both `pageload` and `navigation` transactions in the Sentry UI.

<SignInNote />

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/vue";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  integrations: [
    Sentry.browserTracingIntegration(),
    // alternatively, you can pass a router to the tracing integration
    Sentry.browserTracingIntegration({ router }),
  ],

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```
