To enable tracing, include the `BrowserTracing` integration in your SDK configuration options.

After configuration, you will see both `pageload` and `navigation` transactions in the Sentry UI.


```javascript
// BrowserTracing should only be configured in Electron renderer processes
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/electron/renderer";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  integrations: [new Sentry.browserTracingIntegration()],

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  // Set `tracePropagationTargets` to control for which URLs trace propagation should be enabled
  tracePropagationTargets: ["localhost", /^https:\/\/yourserver\.io\/api/],
});
```
