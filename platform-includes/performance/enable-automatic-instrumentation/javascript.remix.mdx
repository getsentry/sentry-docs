To enable tracing, include `browserTracingIntegration` in your SDK configuration options.

To use `react-router` integration, import and set a custom routing instrumentation using a custom history. Make sure you use a `Router` component combined with `createBrowserHistory` (or equivalent).


```javascript
import { useLocation, useMatches } from "@remix-run/react";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/remix";
import { useEffect } from "react";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "https://examplePublicKey@o0.ingest.sentry.io/0",
  integrations: [
    Sentry.browserTracingIntegration({
      useEffect,
      useLocation,
      useMatches,
    }),
  ],

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for tracing.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

Now you should be generating `pageload`/`navigation` transactions from the `BrowserTracing` integration, using Sentry's [`react-router` instrumentation](/platforms/javascript/guides/react/configuration/integrations/react-router/).
