In addition to OpenTelemetry dependencies and your typical Sentry dependencies, you will need to add `sentry-opentelemetry-core` as a dependency:

```groovy {tabTitle:Gradle}
implementation 'io.sentry:sentry-opentelemetry-core:{{@inject packages.version('sentry.java.opentelemetry-core', '6.9.2') }}'
```
