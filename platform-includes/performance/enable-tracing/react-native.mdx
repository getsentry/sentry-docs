Tracing is enabled by default in the React Native SDK.

<Expandable title="Using older Sentry for React Native? Here is how to enabled Tracing">

If you use a version of our SDK prior to version `3.0.0`, you will need to include the `ReactNativeTracing` integration to use [automatic instrumentation](/platforms/react-native/tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/). You do not need to do this in versions `3.0.0` and above.

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react-native";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  integrations: [new Sentry.ReactNativeTracing()],
});
```
