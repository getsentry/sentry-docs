You can add individual spans to a transaction by calling the `StartChild` method on a transaction. 
This method returns a new `SentrySpan` object that you can use to record the duration of the operation that the span represents. 
When you're done with the operation, you can call the `Finish` method on the span to mark it as finished.

```powershell
# Transaction can be started by providing, at minimum, the name and the operation
$transaction = Start-SentryTransaction 'test-transaction-name' 'test-transaction-operation'

# Transactions can have child spans (and those spans can have child spans as well)
$span = $transaction.StartChild("test-child-operation")
# ...
# (Perform the operation represented by the span/transaction)
# ...
$span.Finish() # Mark the span as finished

$span = $transaction.StartChild("another-span")
# ...
$span.Finish()


$transaction.Finish() # Mark the transaction as finished and send it to Sentry
```
