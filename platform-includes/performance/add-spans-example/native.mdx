For example, if you want to create a transaction for a user interaction in your application:

```c
// Let's say this method is called in a background thread when a user clicks on the checkout button.
void perform_checkout() {
    // This will create a new Transaction for you
    sentry_transaction_context_t *tx_ctx = sentry_transaction_context_new(
        "checkout",
        "perform-checkout"
    );
    sentry_transaction_t *tx = sentry_transaction_start(tx_ctx, sentry_value_new_null());

    // Validate the cart
    sentry_span_t *validation_span = sentry_transaction_start_child(
        tx,
        "validation",
        "validating shopping cart"
    );

    validate_shopping_cart(); // Some long process, maybe a sync http request.

    sentry_span_finish(validation_span);

    // Process the order
    sentry_span_t *process_span = sentry_transaction_start_child(
        tx,
        "process",
        "processing shopping cart"
    );

    process_shopping_cart(); // Another time consuming process.

    sentry_span_finish(process_span);

    sentry_transaction_finish(tx);
}
```

This example will send a transaction named `checkout` to Sentry. The transaction will contain a `validation` span that measures how long `validate_shopping_cart()` took and a `process` span that measures `process_shopping_cart()`. Finally, the call to `sentry_transaction_finish()` will finish the transaction and send it to Sentry.

## Trace Boundaries
By default, transactions will inherit the `trace_id` and `parent_span_id` from the `propagation_context` as generated during SDK initialization. These values can be overridden by calling `sentry_set_trace()`, for example from a downstream SDK, or to define a manual trace boundary:

```c
// Set the trace propagation_context which will be used
//  for all events and transactions/spans

const char *trace_id = "2674eb52d5874b13b560236d6c79ce8a";
const char *parent_span_id = "a0f9fdf04f1a63df";

sentry_set_trace(trace_id, parent_span_id);
perform_checkout(); // trace set before checkout
...
sentry_set_trace(trace_id_2, parent_span_id_2);
```

The format of the `trace_id` and `parent_span_id` should follow the ones defined in [the telemetry docs](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/telemetry/traces/#header-sentry-trace). The `trace_id` should consist of a 32 character hexadecimal string, and the `parent_span_id` should be a 16 character hexadecimal string. For downstream SDKs, these values should match the currently active trace (and span if there is one). For manual trace boundaries, these should be randomly generated.
