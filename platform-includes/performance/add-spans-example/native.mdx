For example, if you want to create a transaction for a user interaction in your application:

```c
// Let's say this method is called in a background thread when a user clicks on the checkout button.
void perform_checkout() {
    // This will create a new Transaction for you
    sentry_transaction_context_t *tx_ctx = sentry_transaction_context_new(
        "checkout",
        "perform-checkout"
    );
    sentry_transaction_t *tx = sentry_transaction_start(tx_ctx, sentry_value_new_null());

    // Validate the cart
    sentry_span_t *validation_span = sentry_transaction_start_child(
        tx,
        "validation",
        "validating shopping cart"
    );

    validate_shopping_cart(); // Some long process, maybe a sync http request.

    sentry_span_finish(validation_span);

    // Process the order
    sentry_span_t *process_span = sentry_transaction_start_child(
        tx,
        "process",
        "processing shopping cart"
    );

    process_shopping_cart(); // Another time consuming process.

    sentry_span_finish(process_span);

    sentry_transaction_finish(tx);
}
```

This example will send a transaction named `checkout` to Sentry. The transaction will contain a `validation` span that measures how long `validate_shopping_cart()` took and a `process` span that measures `process_shopping_cart()`. Finally, the call to `sentry_transaction_finish()` will finish the transaction and send it to Sentry.

## Trace Boundaries
By default, events, transactions, and spans will inherit the `trace_id` from the `propagation_context` as generated during SDK initialization. These values can be overridden by a downstream SDK that calls `sentry_set_trace(trace_id, parent_span_id)`, or by a user who can manually create a trace boundary using `sentry_generate_trace()`:

```c
// Upon init, generates a random trace_id and span_id in the propagation_context
sentry_options_t *options = sentry_options_new();
sentry_init(options);
// Events, transactions and spans will inherit the trace data from this propagation_context
initialize_store();

// trace_id and parent_span_id usually originate from a downstream SDK
//  (which should be the one calling `sentry_set_trace`)
const char *trace_id = "2674eb52d5874b13b560236d6c79ce8a";
const char *parent_span_id = "a0f9fdf04f1a63df";

// Set the trace propagation_context with the given data
sentry_set_trace(trace_id, parent_span_id);
authenticate_user();

// Generates a new random trace and span id onto the propagation_context
sentry_regenerate_trace();
perform_checkout();
```
