## Add More Spans to the Transaction

The next example contains the implementation of the hypothetical `expensive_operation` function called from the code snippet in the previous section. But this time we are using the `trace` function to create a new span and set it as the current span which removes a lot of boilerplate.

You can choose the values of `op` and `description`.

```php
function expensive_operation(): void
{
    $spanContext = \Sentry\Tracing\SpanContext::make()
        ->setOp('some_operation')
        ->setDescription('This is a description');

    \Sentry\trace(function () {
        // Do the expensive operation...
    }, $spanContext);
}
```

You can also do this manually if you want to have more control over the span creation:

```php
function expensive_operation(): void
{
    $parent = \Sentry\SentrySdk::getCurrentHub()->getSpan();
    $span = null;

    // Check if we have a parent span (this is the case if we started a transaction earlier)
    if ($parent !== null) {
        $context = \Sentry\Tracing\SpanContext::make()
            ->setOp('some_operation')
            ->setDescription('This is a description');
        $span = $parent->startChild($context);

        // Set the current span to the span we just started
        \Sentry\SentrySdk::getCurrentHub()->setSpan($span);
    }

    try {
        // Do the expensive operation...
    } finally {
        // We only have a span if we started a span earlier
        if ($span !== null) {
            $span->finish();

            // Restore the current span back to the parent span
            \Sentry\SentrySdk::getCurrentHub()->setSpan($parent);
        }
    }
}
```

This code checks for the existence of a parent span and if there is one, a new span is created and set as the current span. Then we call the expensive operation. Finally, we finish the span and restore the current span to the parent span.
