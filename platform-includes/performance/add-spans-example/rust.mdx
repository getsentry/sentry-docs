For example, if you want to create a transaction for a user interaction in your application:

```rust
// Let's say this method is called in a background thread when a user clicks on the checkout button of your shop
fn perform_checkout() {
    // This will create a new Transaction for you
    let tx_ctx = sentry::TransactionContext::new(
        "checkout",
        "perform-checkout",
    );
    let transaction = sentry::start_transaction(tx_ctx);

    // Validate the cart
    let validation_span = transaction.start_child(
        "validation",
        "validating shopping cart",
    );

    validate_shopping_cart() //Some long process, maybe a sync http request.

    validation_span.finish();

    // Process the order
    let process_span = transaction.start_child(
        "process",
        "processing shopping cart",
    )

    process_shopping_cart() //Another time consuming process.

    process_span.finish();

    transaction.finish();
}
```

This example will send a transaction named `checkout` to Sentry. The transaction will contain a `validation` span that measures how long `validate_shopping_cart()` took and a `process` span that measures `process_shopping_cart()`. Finally, the call to `transaction.finish()` will finish the transaction and send it to Sentry.
