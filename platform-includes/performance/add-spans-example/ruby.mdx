## Add More Spans to the Transaction

The next example contains the implementation of the hypothetical `process_item` function called from the code snippet in the previous section. Our SDK can determine if there is currently an open transaction and add all newly created spans as child operations to that transaction. You can choose the values of `op` and `description`.

```ruby
class OrdersController < ApplicationController
  def create
    order = Order.new

    Sentry.with_child_span(op: :process_items, description: 'processing items') do |span|
      span.set_data(:key, 'value')

      order.process_items(params)
    end
  end # the child span ends with the block
end
```

Your new span will be nested under whichever span is currently
running on the scope, otherwise it will be at the root of the transaction event.

Alternatively, you can manually grab the current transaction and use
its `with_child_span` method to always create a top-level span.

```ruby
class OrdersController < ApplicationController
  def create
    order = Order.new
    transaction = Sentry.get_current_scope.get_transaction

    transaction.with_child_span(op: :process_items, description: 'processing items') do |span|
      span.set_data(:key, 'value')
      order.process_items(params)
    end # the child span ends with the block
  end
end
```

Keep in mind that there may not be an active transaction, in which case `get_transaction` returns `nil`. This case needs to be handled manually and is missing from this example.
