#### Initializing OpenTelemetry

Our `sentry-opentelemetry-agentless-spring` dependency also adds `opentelemetry-spring-boot-starter` which takes care of configuring OpenTelemetry to work with Sentry.


Enable the Sentry propagator for OpenTelemetry by adding the following to your Spring configuration:

```properties {tabTitle: application.properties}
sentry.dsn=___PUBLIC_DSN___
sentry.traces-sample-rate=1.0
otel.propagators=sentry
```

```yaml {tabTitle: application.yml}
sentry:
    dsn: ___PUBLIC_DSN___
    traces-sample-rate: 1.0
otel:
    propagators:
        - sentry
```

The Sentry Spring Boot SDK will take care of the rest.
