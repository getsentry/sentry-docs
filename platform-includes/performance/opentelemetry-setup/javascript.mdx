To use an existing OpenTelemetry setup, set `skipOpenTelemetrySetup: true` in your `init({})` config, then set up all the components that Sentry needs yourself. Finish by installing `@sentry/opentelemetry` and adding the following:

```javascript {tabTitle: NodeTracerProvider}
const Sentry = require("@sentry/node");
const { SentrySpanProcessor, SentryPropagator, SentrySampler } = require("@sentry/opentelemetry");

const { NodeTracerProvider } = require("@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node");

const sentryClient = Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___DSN___",
  skipOpenTelemetrySetup: true,

  // The SentrySampler will use this to determine which traces to sample
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

// Note: This could be BasicTracerProvider or any other provider depending on
// how you are using the OpenTelemetry SDK
const provider = new NodeTracerProvider({
  // Ensure the correct subset of traces is sent to Sentry
  // This also ensures trace propagation works as expected
  sampler: sentryClient ? new SentrySampler(sentryClient) : undefined,
  spanProcessors: [
    // Ensure spans are correctly linked & sent to Sentry
    new SentrySpanProcessor(),
    // Add additional processors here
  ],
});

provider.register({
  // Ensure trace propagation works
  // This relies on the SentrySampler for correct propagation
  propagator: new SentryPropagator(),
  // Ensure context & request isolation are correctly managed
  contextManager: new Sentry.SentryContextManager(),
});

// Validate that the setup is correct
Sentry.validateOpenTelemetrySetup();
```

```javascript {tabTitle: NodeSDK}
const Sentry = require("@sentry/node");

const { NodeSDK } = require("@opentelemetry/sdk-node")
const { SentrySpanProcessor, SentryPropagator, SentrySampler } = require("@sentry/opentelemetry");

const sentryClient = Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  skipOpenTelemetrySetup: true,

  // The SentrySampler will use this to determine which traces to sample
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

const sdk = new NodeSDK({
  // Ensure the correct subset of traces is sent to Sentry
  // This also ensures trace propagation works as expected
  sampler: sentryClient ? new SentrySampler(sentryClient) : undefined,
  spanProcessors: [
    // Ensure spans are correctly linked & sent to Sentry
    new SentrySpanProcessor(),
    // Add additional processors here
  ],
  // Ensure trace propagation works
  // This relies on the SentrySampler for correct propagation
  textMapPropagator: new SentryPropagator(),
  // Ensure context & request isolation are correctly managed
  contextManager: new Sentry.SentryContextManager()
});

sdk.start();

// Validate that the setup is correct
Sentry.validateOpenTelemetrySetup();
```

Make sure that all [Required OpenTelemetry Instrumentation](./#required-instrumentation) is set up correctly. Otherwise, the Sentry SDK may not work as expected.
