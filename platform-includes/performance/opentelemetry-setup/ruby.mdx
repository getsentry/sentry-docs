Initialize Sentry for tracing and set the `instrumenter` to `:otel`:


```ruby {filename:config/initializers/sentry.rb}
Sentry.init do |config|
  config.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
  config.traces_sample_rate = 1.0
  # set the instrumenter to use OpenTelemetry instead of Sentry
  config.instrumenter = :otel
end
```

This disables all Sentry instrumentation and relies on the chosen OpenTelemetry tracers for creating spans.

Next, configure OpenTelemetry as you need and hook in the Sentry span processor and propagator:

```ruby {filename:config/initializers/otel.rb}
OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.use_all
  c.add_span_processor(Sentry::OpenTelemetry::SpanProcessor.instance)
end

OpenTelemetry.propagation = Sentry::OpenTelemetry::Propagator.new
```

Note that if you are using the Ruby OpenTelemetry gem [*pre-v0.24.0*](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-ruby-contrib/tree/main/instrumentation/rack#rack-middleware-vs-rack-events) along with extra Sentry features such as tags / user, you will need to re-order the middleware as below to make sure Sentry's scope management works properly. (After v0.24.0, the gem [uses Rack Events rather than a middleware.](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-ruby-contrib/tree/main/instrumentation/rack#rack-middleware-vs-rack-events))

```ruby {filename:config/initializers/otel.rb}
Rails.application.config.middleware.move_after(
  Sentry::Rails::CaptureExceptions,
  OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::Rack::Middlewares::TracerMiddleware
)
```
