If you're not using any OpenTelemetry exporters besides Sentry, add
the following environment variables to turn off exporters and stop receiving error messages about
servers not being reachable in the logs.

Example log message:

```
ERROR io.opentelemetry.exporter.internal.grpc.OkHttpGrpcExporter - Failed to export spans. The request could not be executed. Full error message: Failed to connect to localhost/[0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1]:4317
ERROR io.opentelemetry.exporter.internal.grpc.OkHttpGrpcExporter - Failed to export metrics. The request could not be executed. Full error message: Failed to connect to localhost/[0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1]:4317
ERROR io.opentelemetry.exporter.internal.http.HttpExporter - Failed to export logs. The request could not be executed. Full error message: Failed to connect to localhost/[0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1]:4318
```

#### Traces

To turn off traces exporting, set `OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=none` as an environment variable per [OpenTelemetry GitHub](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/tree/main/sdk-extensions/autoconfigure#otlp-exporter-span-metric-and-log-exporters).

#### Metrics

To turn off metrics exporting, set `OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=none` as an environment variable per [OpenTelemetry GitHub](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/tree/main/sdk-extensions/autoconfigure#otlp-exporter-span-metric-and-log-exporters).

#### Logs

To turn off log exporting, set `OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER=none` as an environment variable per [OpenTelemetry GitHub](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/tree/main/sdk-extensions/autoconfigure#otlp-exporter-span-metric-and-log-exporters).
