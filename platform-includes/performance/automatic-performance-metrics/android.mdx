If configured, the Android SDK automatically collects the following performance metrics:

- <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#app-start-instrumentation"> Cold and warm app start time </PlatformLink>
  .
- <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#slow-and-frozen-frames"> Slow and frozen frame rendering </PlatformLink>
  .

## Application Not Responding (ANR) Rate

Application Not Responding (ANR) errors are triggered when the main UI thread of an application is blocked for more than five seconds. When configured, Sentry's Android SDK reports [ANR errors](/platforms/android/configuration/app-not-respond/).

For detailed information about ANR rate metrics, including user-perceived ANR rate, foreground ANR rate, and how to view them in Sentry, see [ANR Rate](/platforms/android/configuration/app-not-respond/#anr-rate).
