To enable automatic tracing you need to update the configuration of your client and server instrumentation:
- For client-side tracing, include the `reactRouterTracingIntegration` to your integrations array.
- Additionally you need to set the `tracesSampleRate` in your `Sentry.init()` calls.

```javascript {tabTitle:Client} {filename:entry.client.tsx} {7,11}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react-router";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // This enables automatic instrumentation for client-side navigations
  integrations: [Sentry.reactRouterTracingIntegration()],

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  
  // Set `tracePropagationTargets` to control for which URLs trace propagation should be enabled
  tracePropagationTargets: ["localhost", /^https:\/\/yourserver\.io\/api/],

  // ... rest of your config
});

// ... rest of the file
```

```javascript {tabTitle:Server} {filename:instrument.server.(mjs|ts)} {8}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react-router";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,

  // ... rest of your config
});
```
