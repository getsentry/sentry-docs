Set `tracesSampleRate` in `sentry.client.config.js`, as well as in the Sentry setup in `instrumentation.(js|ts)`:

<SignInNote />

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using `tracesSampler`
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```
