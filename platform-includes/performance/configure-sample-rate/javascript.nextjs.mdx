Set `tracesSampleRate` in your config files:
- `sentry.server.config.js`
- `sentry.edge.config.js`:
- `instrumentation-client.js`
  - If you previously had a file called `sentry.client.config.(js|ts)`, you can safely rename this to `instrumentation-client.(js|ts)` for all Next.js versions.

```javascript {tabTitle:Client} {filename:instrumentation-client.(js|ts)}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using `tracesSampler`
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  // ... rest of your config
});

// This export will instrument router navigations, and is only relevant if you enable tracing.
// `captureRouterTransitionStart` is available from SDK version 9.12.0 onwards
export const onRouterTransitionStart = Sentry.captureRouterTransitionStart;
```

```javascript {tabTitle:Server} {filename:sentry.server.config.(js|ts)}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using `tracesSampler`
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  // ... rest of your config
});
```

```javascript {tabTitle:Edge} {filename:sentry.edge.config.(js|ts)}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using `tracesSampler`
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  // ... rest of your config
});
```
