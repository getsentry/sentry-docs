Tracing is available for our updated Ruby SDK (`sentry-ruby`, not `sentry-raven`).

```ruby
Sentry.init do |config|
  #...

  # Set a uniform sample rate between 0.0 and 1.0
  # We recommend adjusting the value in production:
  config.traces_sample_rate = 1.0

  # or control sampling dynamically
  config.traces_sampler = lambda do |sampling_context|
    # sampling_context[:transaction_context] contains the information about the transaction
    # sampling_context[:parent_sampled] contains the transaction's parent's sample decision
    true # return value can be a boolean or a float between 0.0 and 1.0
  end
end
```
