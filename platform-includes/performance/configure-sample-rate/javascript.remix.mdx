### Client-Side Tracing

Sentry's client-side tracing captures `pageload` and `navigation` transactions when configured correctly. This is useful for understanding the performance of your application from the user's perspective.

```typescript {tabTitle:Client} {filename: entry.client.tsx}
import { useLocation, useMatches } from "@remix-run/react";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/remix";
import { useEffect } from "react";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    Sentry.browserTracingIntegration({
      useEffect,
      useLocation,
      useMatches,
    }),
  ],

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for tracing.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,

  // Set `tracePropagationTargets` to control for which URLs trace propagation should be enabled
  tracePropagationTargets: ["localhost", /^https:\/\/yourserver\.io\/api/],
});
```

### Server-Side Tracing

Sentry's server-side tracing captures transactions for your Remix `loader`s, `action`s, and request handlers. You can also capture transactions for your database operations.

```typescript {tabTitle:Server} {filename: entry.server.tsx}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/remix";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for tracing.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```
