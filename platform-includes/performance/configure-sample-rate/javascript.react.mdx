```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // This enables automatic instrumentation (highly recommended)
  // If you only want to use custom instrumentation:
  // * Remove the `BrowserTracing` integration
  // * add `Sentry.addTracingExtensions()` above your Sentry.init() call
  integrations: [
    Sentry.browserTracingIntegration(),
    // Or, if you are using react router, use the appropriate integration
    // See docs for support for different versions of react router
    // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/react/configuration/integrations/react-router/
  ],

  // For finer control of sent transactions you can adjust this value, or
  // use tracesSampler
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,

  // Set `tracePropagationTargets` to control for which URLs trace propagation should be enabled
  tracePropagationTargets: ["localhost", /^https:\/\/yourserver\.io\/api/],
});
```
