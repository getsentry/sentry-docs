```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/bun";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [],
});
```

## Cloudflare Pages

To use this SDK, add the `sentryPagesPlugin` as
[middleware to your Cloudflare Pages application](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/middleware/).

We recommend adding a `functions/_middleware.js` for the middleware setup so that Sentry is initialized for your entire
app.

```javascript
// functions/_middleware.js
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/cloudflare";

export const onRequest = [
  // Make sure Sentry is the first middleware
  Sentry.sentryPagesPlugin((context) => ({
    dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
    // for finer control
    tracesSampleRate: 1.0,

    // Set `tracePropagationTargets` to control for which URLs trace propagation should be enabled
    tracePropagationTargets: ["localhost", /^https:\/\/yourserver\.io\/api/],
  })),
  // Add more middlewares here
];
```

## Cloudflare Workers

To use this SDK, wrap your handler with the `withSentry` function. This will initialize the SDK and hook into the
environment. Note that you can turn off almost all side effects using the respective options.

Currently only ESM handlers are supported.

```javascript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/cloudflare';

export default withSentry(
  env => ({
    dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
    // for finer control
    tracesSampleRate: 1.0,

    // Set `tracePropagationTargets` to control for which URLs trace propagation should be enabled
    tracePropagationTargets: ["localhost", /^https:\/\/yourserver\.io\/api/],
  }),
  {
    async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
      return new Response('Hello World!');
    },
  } satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>,
);
```
