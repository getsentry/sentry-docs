Set `tracesSampleRate` in your config files, `sentry.client.config.(js|ts)` and `instrument.server.mjs`:


```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nuxt";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using `tracesSampler`
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```
