<Alert title="parentSampleRate">

The `parentSampleRate` sampling context was introduced in version 9 of the SDK.
To inherit sampling decisions in earlier versions of the SDK, us the `parentSampled` sampling context.

Going forward, using `parentSampleRate` is strongly encouraged over using `parentSampled`, because it allows for deterministic sampling and metric extrapolation for downstream traces.
