## Connect Errors With Spans

Sentry errors can be linked with transactions and spans.

Errors reported to Sentry are automatically linked to any running transaction or span that is **bound to the scope**. There is only one global scope in the native SDK, and only one transaction or span can be bound to the scope at once. In a multi-threaded application, all errors are linked to the single transaction or span bound to the scope.

```c
sentry_transaction_context_t *tx_ctx = sentry_transaction_context_new(
    "checkout",
    "perform-checkout",
);
sentry_transaction_t *tx = sentry_transaction_start(tx_ctx, sentry_value_new_null());

// Bind the transaction / span to the scope:
sentry_set_span(tx);

// Errors captured after the line above will be linked to the transaction
sentry_value_t exc = sentry_value_new_exception(
    "ParseIntError",
    "invalid digit found in string",
);

sentry_value_t event = sentry_value_new_event();
sentry_event_add_exception(event, exc);
sentry_capture_event(event);

sentry_transaction_finish(tx);
```
