You can prevent ad blockers from blocking Sentry events using tunneling. Use the `tunnel` option to add an API endpoint in your application that forwards Sentry events to Sentry servers.

To enable tunneling, update `Sentry.init` in your `hooks.client.(js|ts)` file with the following option:

```javascript {filename:hooks.client.(js|ts)} {3}
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",,
  tunnel: "/tunnel",
});
```

This will send all events to the `tunnel` endpoint. However, the events need to be parsed and redirected to Sentry, so you'll need to do additional configuration on the server. You can find a detailed explanation on how to do this on our [Troubleshooting page](/platforms/javascript/guides/sveltekit/troubleshooting/#using-the-tunnel-option).
