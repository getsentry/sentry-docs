### FlutterError.onError

Flutter-specific errors, such as using `FlutterError.onError`, are captured automatically.

### PlatformDispatcher.onError / runZonedGuarded

The SDK already runs your init `callback` on an error handler, such as [`runZonedGuarded`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-async/runZonedGuarded.html) on Flutter versions prior to `3.3`, or [`PlatformDispatcher.onError`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/PlatformDispatcher/onError.html) on Flutter versions 3.3 and higher, so that errors are automatically captured.

If you need a custom error handling zone which also provides automatic error reporting and breadcrumb tracking, use `Sentry.runZonedGuarded`. It wraps Dart's native [`runZonedGuarded`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-async/runZonedGuarded.html) function with Sentry-specific functionality.

This function automatically records calls to `print()` as `Breadcrumbs` and can be configured using `SentryOptions.enablePrintBreadcrumbs`.

```dart
Sentry.runZonedGuarded(() async {
  WidgetsBinding.ensureInitialized();

  // Errors before init will not be handled by Sentry

  await SentryFlutter.init(
    (options) {
    ...
    },
    appRunner: () => runApp(MyApp()),
  );
} (error, stackTrace) {
  // Automatically sends errors to Sentry, no need to do any
  // captureException calls on your part.
  // On top of that, you can do your own custom stuff in this callback.
});
```
