To capture an event in Go, you can pass any struct implementing an `error` interface to `CaptureException()`. If you use a 3rd party library instead of the native `errors` package and it implements the `Unwrap() error` or `Cause() error` method, we'll follow the chain of errors and extract the stack trace from the root cause.

The SDK is fully compatible with (but not limited to):

- `github.com/pkg/errors`
- `github.com/go-errors/errors`
- `github.com/pingcap/errors`
- `github.com/rotisserie/eris`

If there is an errors package that's not working out of the box, let us know!

```go
f, err := os.Open("filename.ext")
if err != nil {
	sentry.CaptureException(err)
}
```
