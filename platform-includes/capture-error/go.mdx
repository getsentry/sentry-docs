To capture an event in Go, you can pass any struct implementing an `error` interface to `CaptureException()`. The SDK automatically unwraps and captures all errors in the error chain, providing comprehensive error context to Sentry. The SDK also supports third-party libraries and extracts all stack traces in the chain.

## Error Unwrapping

The SDK supports multiple error wrapping patterns:

- **Standard library**: `fmt.Errorf` with `%w` and `errors.Join` (Go 1.20+)
- **Single error chains**: Errors implementing `Unwrap() error`
- **Third-party libraries**: Errors implementing `Cause() error`

The SDK is fully compatible with (but not limited to):

- `github.com/pkg/errors`
- `github.com/go-errors/errors`
- `github.com/pingcap/errors`
- `github.com/rotisserie/eris`

If there is an errors package that's not working out of the box, let us know!

## Exception Groups

When you use `errors.Join` to combine multiple errors, the SDK captures them as an **exception group**. This allows you to see all related errors together in Sentry, properly structured with their relationships preserved.

```go
err1 := errors.New("first error")
err2 := errors.New("second error")
joinedErr := errors.Join(err1, err2)

// This will be captured as an exception group in Sentry
sentry.CaptureException(joinedErr)
```

For errors wrapped with `fmt.Errorf` or single-error chains, the SDK captures each error in the chain individually, maintaining the causal relationship.

## Basic Example

```go
f, err := os.Open("filename.ext")
if err != nil {
	sentry.CaptureException(err)
}
```
