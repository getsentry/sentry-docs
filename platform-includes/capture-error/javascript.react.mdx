By including and configuring Sentry, our React SDK automatically attaches global handlers to _capture_ uncaught exceptions and unhandled promise rejections, as described in the official ECMAScript 6 standard. You can disable this default behavior by changing the `onunhandledrejection` option to `false` in your GlobalHandlers integration and manually hook into each event handler, then call `Sentry.captureException` or `Sentry.captureMessage` directly.

You can pass an `Error` object to `captureException()` to get it captured as an event. It's also possible to pass non-`Error` objects and strings, but be aware that the resulting events in Sentry may be missing a stack trace.

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";

try {
  aFunctionThatMightFail();
} catch (err) {
  Sentry.captureException(err);
}
```

Sentry calls like `captureException` or `captureMessage` are side effects, so they should be wrapped in a `useEffect` hook to avoid triggering them on every render.

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";
import { useEffect } from "react";

function App() {
  const [info, error] = useQuery("/api/info");
  useEffect(() => {
    if (error) {
      Sentry.captureException(error);
    }
  }, [error]);

  // ...
}
```

The React SDK exports an error boundary component that leverages [React component APIs](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html) to automatically catch and send JavaScript errors from inside a React component tree to Sentry. See the [React Error Boundary](/platforms/javascript/guides/react/features/error-boundary/) guide for more information.

If you don't want to use the error boundary component, you can use the `captureReactException` function to capture errors manually. The `Sentry.captureReactException` function requires Sentry React SDK `v9.8.0` or above.

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";

class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  componentDidCatch(error, info) {
    Sentry.captureReactException(error, info);
  }

  render() {
    return this.props.children;
  }
}
```

Starting with React 19, the `createRoot` and `hydrateRoot` methods from `react-dom` will expose error hooks that are used to capture errors automatically. To customize how errors are handled in specific error hooks, use the `Sentry.reactErrorHandler` method. The `Sentry.reactErrorHandler` method requires `v8.6.0` or above.

```javascript
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react';

const container = document.getElementById(“app”);
const root = createRoot(container, {
  // Callback called when an error is thrown and not caught by an ErrorBoundary.
  onUncaughtError: Sentry.reactErrorHandler((error, errorInfo) => {
    console.warn('Uncaught error', error, errorInfo.componentStack);
  }),
  // Callback called when React catches an error in an ErrorBoundary.
  onCaughtError: Sentry.reactErrorHandler(),
  // Callback called when React automatically recovers from errors.
  onRecoverableError: Sentry.reactErrorHandler(),
});
root.render();
```

These hooks apply to all React components that are mounted to the container which is passed onto `createRoot`/`hydrateRoot`. For more precise control over error handling, we recommend adding an `ErrorBoundary` component to your application.
