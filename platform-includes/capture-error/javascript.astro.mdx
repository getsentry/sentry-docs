You can pass an `Error` object to `captureException()` to have it captured as an event. It's also possible to pass non-`Error` objects and strings, but be aware that the resulting events in Sentry may be missing a stack trace.

```html {filename:Component.astro}
<!-- Make sure this script tag is placed at the top inside the <body> tag (for example, inside a Layout slot) -->
<script>
  import * as Sentry from "@sentry/astro";

  try {
    aFunctionThatMightFail();
  } catch (err) {
    Sentry.captureException(err);
  }
</script>
```
