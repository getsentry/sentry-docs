You can pass an `Error` object to `captureException()` to get it captured as event. It's also possible to pass non-`Error` objects and strings, but be aware that the resulting events in Sentry may be missing a stack trace.

```typescript {filename:some.component.ts} {1,6}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/angular";

try {
  aFunctionThatMightFail();
} catch (err) {
  Sentry.captureException(err);
}
```
