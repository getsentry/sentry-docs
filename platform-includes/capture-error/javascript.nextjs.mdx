You can pass an `Error` object to `captureException()` to get it captured as an event. It's also possible to pass non-`Error` objects and strings, but be aware that the resulting events in Sentry may be missing a stack trace.

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

try {
  aFunctionThatMightFail();
} catch (err) {
  Sentry.captureException(err);
}
```

### Capturing Errors in `error.js` Files

Note that if you create [Next.js `error.js` files](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/error-handling), these files will take precedence over any global error handling.
This means, that if you want to report errors that are caught by `error.js` files, you need to manually capture them:

```tsx {filename:error.tsx}
"use client";

import { useEffect } from "react";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

export default function ErrorPage({
  error,
}: {
  error: Error & { digest?: string };
}) {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Log the error to Sentry
    Sentry.captureException(error);
  }, [error]);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Something went wrong!</h2>
    </div>
  );
}
```

```jsx {filename:error.jsx}
"use client";

import { useEffect } from "react";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

export default function ErrorPage({ error }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Log the error to Sentry
    Sentry.captureException(error);
  }, [error]);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Something went wrong!</h2>
    </div>
  );
}
```
