When using `git-commit-id-plugin`, thanks to Spring Boot Starter the release field is set automatically. See our documentation for [Advanced Usage](/platforms/java/guides/spring-boot/advanced-usage/#using-git-commit-id-as-the-release) of the Spring Boot integration for more details.

Otherwise, release can be set manually in `application.properties` file:

```properties {tabTitle: application.properties}
sentry.release=my-project-name@2.3.12
```

```yaml {tabTitle: application.yml}
sentry.release: "my-project-name@2.3.12"
```
