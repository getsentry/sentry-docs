```csharp {tabTitle:C#}
// Add this to the SDK initialization callback
options.Release = "my-project-name@2.3.12";
```

```fsharp {tabTitle:F#}
// Add this to the SDK initialization callback
options.Release <- "my-project-name@2.3.12"
```

The SDK attempts to locate the release to add to events sent to Sentry.

The SDK will first check for a version set on the environment via `SENTRY_RELEASE` and use it as-is.

If no version can be found it falls back to look at the [entry assembly's](<https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.assembly.getentryassembly(v=vs.110).aspx>) `AssemblyInformationalVersionAttribute`, which accepts a string as value and is often used to set a GIT commit hash. If that returns null, it'll look at the default `AssemblyVersionAttribute` which accepts the numeric version number. The resulting release will be in the format `assembly-name@version`.
