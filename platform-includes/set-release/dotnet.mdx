```csharp {tabTitle:C#}
// Add this to the SDK initialization callback
options.Release = "my-project-name@2.3.12";
```

```fsharp {tabTitle:F#}
// Add this to the SDK initialization callback
options.Release <- "my-project-name@2.3.12"
```

The SDK attempts to locate the release to attach to events sent to Sentry.

The SDK will first check if there's a version set on the environment via `SENTRY_RELEASE` and use it as-is.

If no version is found, the SDK will look at the [entry assembly's](<https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.reflection.assembly.getentryassembly(v=vs.110).aspx>) `AssemblyInformationalVersionAttribute`, which accepts a string value and is often used to set a GIT commit hash. If that returns null, then the SDK will look at the default `AssemblyVersionAttribute`, which accepts the numeric version number. The resulting release will be in the format `<assembly-name>@<version-number>`.
