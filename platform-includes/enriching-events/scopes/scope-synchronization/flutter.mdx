### Scope Synchronization

Starting with version `6.6.0` of the SDK, setting data on the Flutter `Scope` can be synced to the Android and iOS SDKs. This behavior is enabled by default and can be disabled by setting `SentryOptions.enableScopeSync` to false. The following `Scope` methods will sync and can also be awaited upon:

- `setContexts`
- `removeContexts`
- `setUser`
- `addBreadcrumb`
- `clearBreadcrumbs`
- `setExtra`
- `removeExtra`
- `setTag`
- `removeTag`
