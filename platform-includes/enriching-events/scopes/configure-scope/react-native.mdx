```javascript
Sentry.configureScope(function (scope) {
  scope.setTag("my-tag", "my value");
  scope.setUser({
    id: 42,
    email: "john.doe@example.com",
  });
});
```

### Scope Synchronization

If you want to set context data in the JS layer and then receive that context data when a native (C/C++) crash happens, you need to synchronize the JS `Scope` with the native `Scope`. This feature was introduced in version `2.0.0` of the React-Native SDK and requires an opt-in:


```javascript {filename:App.js}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react-native";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  enableNdkScopeSync: true,
});
```
