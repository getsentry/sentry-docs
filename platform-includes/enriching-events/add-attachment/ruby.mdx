```ruby
Sentry.add_attachment(path: '/path/to/attachment/file.txt')
Sentry.add_attachment(filename: 'payload.json', bytes: '{"value": 42}'))
```

These attachments live on the current `Scope` and will be sent with all events.
You can also add them directly on the scope as follows:

```ruby
Sentry.configure_scope do |scope|
  scope.add_attachment(path: '/path/to/attachment/file.txt')
  scope.add_attachment(filename: 'payload.json', bytes: '{"value": 42}'))
end
```


An attachment has the following fields:

`path`

The path to the attachment file. The `filename` will be inferred if not explicitly provided when using this mode.

`bytes`

The content of the attachment as bytes.

`filename`

The filename is required if using `bytes` and will be displayed in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

`content_type`

The type of content stored in this attachment. Any [MIME type](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml) may be used.
