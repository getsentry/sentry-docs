Because attachments live on the <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/scopes/">Scope</PlatformLink>, the SDK sends all attachments on a given `Scope` with every non-transaction event captured within the `Scope`. It's also possible to send an attachment with all events, including transactions by setting the `add_to_transactions` option to `True`.

```python {tabTitle:Python (SDK 2.x)}
# Add an attachment
import sentry_sdk

scope = sentry_sdk.get_current_scope()
scope.add_attachment(bytes=b"Hello World!", filename="attachment.txt")
scope.add_attachment(path="/path/to/attachment/file.txt")
```

```python {tabTitle:Python (SDK 1.x)}
# Add an attachment
from sentry_sdk import Scope

# Scope.get_current_scope() or Scope.get_global_scope() can also be used.
# Read about the different scopes on our Scope docs page.
scope = Scope.get_isolation_scope()

# Add attachment titled "attachment.txt" with content "Hello World!"
scope.add_attachment(bytes=b"Hello World!", filename="attachment.txt")

# Attach the file located at /path/to/attachment/file.txt
scope.add_attachment(path="/path/to/attachment/file.txt")

# This attachment will also be sent with transactions
scope.add_attachment(path="/other/attachment.txt", add_to_transactions=True)
```


The `add_attachment` method has the following parameters:
  - `bytes`: Raw bytes of the attachment, or a function that returns the raw bytes. Must be provided unless a `path` to the attachment file is provided.
  - `filename`: The filename of the attachment which we display in Sentry. Optional only if a `path` is provided, since we can infer the `filename` from the `path`.
  - `path`: Path to a file to attach. Must be provided unless `bytes` is provided.
  - `content_type`: The attachment's [MIME type](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml). If not provided, it will be guessed from the attachment's file name provided via `filename` or inferred from `path`.
  - `add_to_transactions`: Whether to add this attachment to transactions. Defaults to `False`.
