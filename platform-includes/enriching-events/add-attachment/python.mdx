Attachments live on the `Scope` and will be sent with all events.

```python {tabTitle:Python (SDK 2.x)}
# Add an attachment
import sentry_sdk

scope = sentry_sdk.get_current_scope()
scope.add_attachment(bytes=b"Hello World!", filename="attachment.txt")
scope.add_attachment(path="/path/to/attachment/file.txt")
```

```python {tabTitle:Python (SDK 1.x)}
# Add an attachment
from sentry_sdk import configure_scope

with configure_scope() as scope:
    scope.add_attachment(bytes=b"Hello World!", filename="attachment.txt")
    scope.add_attachment(path="/path/to/attachment/file.txt")
```

An attachment has the following fields:

`path`

The path to the attachment file. The `filename` and `content_type` will be inferred if not explicitly provided when using this mode.

`bytes`

The content of the attachment as bytes.

`filename`

The filename is required if using `bytes` and will be displayed in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

`content_type`

The type of content stored in this attachment. Any [MIME type](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml) may be used; the default is `application/octet-stream`.
