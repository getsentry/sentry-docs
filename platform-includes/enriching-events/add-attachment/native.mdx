To add an attachment, you can either configure it when initializing the SDK, or manipulate the list of attachments in the scope.

### SDK Initialization

Adding attachments to the options during SDK initialization will monitor the file and upload it along with any event or crash that is sent to Sentry:

```c
sentry_options_add_attachment(options, "/var/server.log");
```

### Adding Attachments to the Scope

Adding attachments to the global scope at run-time after SDK initialization will monitor the file and upload it along with any event or crash that is sent to Sentry, whereas adding attachments to a local scope will only upload the file with the specific event captured in that local scope.

```c
// Global Scope
sentry_attach_file("/var/global.log");

// Local Scope
sentry_scope_t *scope = sentry_local_scope_new();
sentry_scope_attach_file(scope, "/var/local.log");
sentry_value_t event = sentry_value_new_event();
/* ... */
sentry_capture_event_with_scope(event, scope);
```

<Alert>‚òù When using the `crashpad` backend on macOS, the list of attachments that will be added at the time of a hard crash will be frozen at the time of `sentry_init`, and later modifications will not be reflected.</Alert>

### Removing Scoped Attachments

To remove attachments from the global scope, you can use the `sentry_attachment_t` handle returned by `sentry_attach_file`. After removing the attachment, the file will no longer be uploaded with any future events or crashes and the handle becomes invalid.

```c
sentry_attachment_t *attachment = sentry_attach_file("/var/temp.log");
/* ... */
sentry_remove_attachment(attachment);
```
