To add an attachment, you can either configure it when initializing the SDK, or manipulate the list of attachments in the scope.

### SDK Initialization

Adding attachments during SDK initialization is supported on all platforms. It will monitor the file and upload it along with any event or crash that is sent to Sentry:

```c
sentry_options_add_attachment(options, "/var/server.log");
```

### Global Scope

Adding attachments to the global scope at run-time after SDK initialization is supported on Windows and Linux. It will monitor the file and upload it along with any event or crash that is sent to Sentry:

```c
sentry_add_attachment_path("/var/server.log");
```

### Local Scope

Adding attachments to local scopes is supported on Windows and Linux. It will upload the file along with the specific event captured in the local scope:

```c
sentry_scope_t *scope = sentry_local_scope_new();
sentry_scope_add_attachment_path(scope, "/var/server.log");
sentry_capture_event_with_scope(event, scope);
```
