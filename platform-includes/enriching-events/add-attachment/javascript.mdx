Attachments live on the `Scope` and will be sent with all events.

```javascript
// Add an attachment
Sentry.getCurrentScope().addAttachment({
  filename: "attachment.txt",
  data: "Some content",
});

// Clear attachments
Sentry.getCurrentScope().clearAttachments();
```

An attachment has the following fields:

`filename`

The filename is required and will be displayed in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

`data`

The content of the attachment is required and is either a `string` or `Uint8Array`.

`contentType`

The type of content stored in this attachment. Any [MIME
type](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml) may be
used; the default is `application/octet-stream`.

`mimetype`

The specific media content type that determines how the attachment is rendered in the Sentry UI. We currently support and can render the following MIME types:

- `text/plain`
- `text/css`
- `text/csv`
- `text/html`
- `text/javascript`
- `text/json` or `text/x-json` or `application/json` or `application/ld+json`
- `image/jpeg`
- `image/png`
- `image/gif`

## Add or Modify Attachments Before Sending

It's possible to add, remove, or modify attachments before an event is sent by way of
the <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#before-send"><PlatformIdentifier name="before-send" /></PlatformLink>
hook or a global event processor.


```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  beforeSend: (event, hint) => {
    hint.attachments = [{ filename: "screenshot.png", data: captureScreen() }];
    return event;
  },
});

Sentry.addEventProcessor((event, hint) => {
  hint.attachments = [{ filename: "log.txt", data: readLogFile() }];
  return event;
});
```
