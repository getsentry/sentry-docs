```csharp
SentrySdk.ConfigureScope(scope =>
{
    scope.AddAttachment(Path.Combine(Application.persistentDataPath, "file.log"));
});
```

Note that there are restrictions in place when using paths in combination with [StreamingAssets](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.4/Documentation/Manual/StreamingAssets.html) and the [Resource folder](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Resources.html).
