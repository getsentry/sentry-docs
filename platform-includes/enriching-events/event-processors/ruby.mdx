Event processors added to the global scope will run on every event sent after they've been added.

```ruby
Sentry.init do |config|
  # ...
end

Sentry.configure_scope do |scope|
  scope.add_event_processor do |event, hint|
     # can mutate the event here
     # returning nil will drop the event
     event.tags = { foo: 42 }
     event
  end
end

# You can do the same thing using add_global_event_processor
Sentry.add_global_event_processor do |event, hint|
  event.tags = { foo: 42 }
  event
end
```

Event processors added to a local scope using `with_scope` will only apply to events captured inside that scope.

```ruby
Sentry.with_scope do |scope|
  scope.add_event_processor do |event, hint|
     # can mutate the event here
     # returning nil will drop the event
     event.tags = { foo: 42 }
     event
  end

  # The event processor will apply to this event
  Sentry.captureMessage("Test");
end

# The event processor will NOT apply to this event
Sentry.captureMessage("Test2");
```
