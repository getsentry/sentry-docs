```ruby
Sentry.configure_scope do |scope|
  scope.set_context(
    'character',
    {
      name: 'Mighty Fighter',
      age: 19,
      attack_type: 'melee'
    }
  )
end
```

In Rails, the best place to do this is usually in a `before_action` hook in your controller or somewhere in your model logic.
Any data set in `configure_scope` will be shared and isolated across a single request/response cycle.
