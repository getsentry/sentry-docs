The React Native SDK captures breadcrumbs automatically using the native Android and iOS SDKs:

- [Automatic breadcrumbs for Android](/platforms/android/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/#automatic-breadcrumbs)
- [Automatic breadcrumbs for iOS](/platforms/apple/integrations/default/#sentryautobreadcrumbtrackingintegration)

More breadcrumbs can be captured by the React Native SDK:

- For interaction breadcrumbs, wrap your root component using the [`Sentry.wrap`](/platforms/react-native/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#wrap-your-root-component) method.
- For navigation breadcrumbs, use one of the [SDK's navigation integrations](/platforms/react-native/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#enable-routing-instrumentation).
- `HTTP` requests are included in breadcrumbs by default.
- To track redux actions and latest store state, use [`Sentry.createReduxEnhancer`](/platforms/javascript/guides/react/configuration/integrations/redux).
