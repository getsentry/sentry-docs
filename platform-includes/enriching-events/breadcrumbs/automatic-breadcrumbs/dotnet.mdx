The .NET SDK captures breadcrumbs automatically for:

- **HTTP requests** made using `HttpClient` are captured automatically when using `SentryHttpMessageHandler`. See <PlatformLink to="/configuration/http-client-errors/">HTTP Client Errors</PlatformLink> for setup instructions.

- **Logs** 
  - Logs at or above a configured level are captured as breadcrumbs when using logging integrations:
  - <PlatformLink to="/guides/extensions-logging/">Microsoft.Extensions.Logging</PlatformLink> (default breadcrumb level: `Information`)
  - <PlatformLink to="/guides/serilog/">Serilog</PlatformLink>
  - <PlatformLink to="/guides/nlog/">NLog</PlatformLink>
  - <PlatformLink to="/guides/log4net/">log4net</PlatformLink>

- **Database Queries** 
  - Database queries are captured as breadcrumbs for <PlatformLink to="/guides/entityframework/">Entity Framework 6</PlatformLink>. For Entity Framework Core, queries are captured automatically via the DiagnosticSource integration (see <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#diagnosticsource-integration">Automatic Instrumentation</PlatformLink>).

- **MAUI Application Events** 
  - For <PlatformLink to="/guides/maui/">MAUI</PlatformLink> applications, the SDK captures application lifecycle and user interaction events including navigation, window lifecycle, element rendering, and user actions.

- **GraphQL Requests** 
  - When using `SentryGraphQLHttpMessageHandler` GraphQL requests are captured as breadcrumbs, including query type, operation name, and performance data.
