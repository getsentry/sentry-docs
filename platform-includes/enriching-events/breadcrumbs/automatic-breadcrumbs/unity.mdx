The Unity SDK captures breadcrumbs automatically for:

- **Unity Logs** 
  -  Unity logs from the built-in logging system are captured when using the default `UnityApplicationLoggingIntegration`:
  - `Debug.Log` (captured at `Info` level)
  - `Debug.LogWarning` (captured at `Warning` level)
  - `Debug.LogError` and `Debug.LogAssert` (captured at `Error` level)

- **Scene Events** 
-   Scene events are captured when using `SceneManagerIntegration`:
  - Scene loaded
  - Scene unloaded
  - Active scene changed

- **Application Lifecycle Events** 
  - These are captured when `AutoSessionTracking` is enabled (default):
  - Application focus gained/lost
  - Application paused/resumed

- **Low Memory Warnings** 
  - Low memory warnings from Unity's system events are captured automatically when using `LowMemoryIntegration`.

- **Native Platform Breadcrumbs** 
  -  Captured when native support is enabled (default for Android, iOS, macOS, and other platforms):
  - **Android**: Activity lifecycle, system events, user interactions, and HTTP requests via the Sentry Android SDK
  - **iOS/macOS**: Application lifecycle, UIControl events, system events (battery, memory, orientation), and HTTP requests via the Sentry Cocoa SDK
  - **Other platforms**: Native crash handling and scope synchronization via `sentry-native`
