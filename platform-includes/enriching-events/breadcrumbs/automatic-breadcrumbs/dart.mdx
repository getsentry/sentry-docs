To track automatic [Breadcrumbs for HTTP requests](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/data-model/event-payloads/breadcrumbs/#breadcrumb-types), you can add a Sentry wrapper that does it automatically for you.

This is only possible if you are using the [http.Client](https://pub.dev/documentation/http/latest/http/Client-class.html) class from the [http](https://pub.dev/packages/http) library.

The `SentryHttpClient` can be used as a standalone client like this:

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';

final client = SentryHttpClient();
try {
  final url = 'https://example.com/whatsit/create';
  final response = await client.post(url, body: {
    'name': 'doodle',
    'color': 'blue',
  });
  print('Response body: ${response.body}');
} finally {
  client.close();
}
```

The `SentryHttpClient` can also be used as a wrapper for your own `HTTP Client`:

```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';

final myClient = http.Client();
final client = SentryHttpClient(client: myClient);
try {
  final url = 'https://example.com/whatsit/create';
  final response = await client.post(url, body: {
    'name': 'doodle',
    'color': 'blue',
  });
  print('Response body: ${response.body}');
} finally {
  client.close();
}
```
