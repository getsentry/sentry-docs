The Python SDK captures breadcrumbs automatically for:

- Incoming HTTP requests are included in breadcrumbs by default in <PlatformLink to="/integrations/#web-frameworks">supported web frameworks</PlatformLink>.

- Logs at or above a configured `level` are captured as breadcrumbs when using Pythonâ€™s built-in logging module or other supported logging integrations.

- Database queries and Redis commands are added as breadcrumbs for <PlatformLink to="/integrations/#databases">supported libraries</PlatformLink>.

- Breadcrumbs are created for Popen subprocesses.

- Breadcrumbs are made for the start and end of Spark jobs and submission and completion of Spark stages.
