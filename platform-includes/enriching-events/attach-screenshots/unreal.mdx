Using the editor menu in **Project Settings > Plugins > Sentry**:

![Options Screenshot Configuration](./img/attach-screenshot-unreal-editor.png)

Or, like so, if you're [configuring things programatically](/platforms/unreal/configuration/options/):

```cpp
USentrySettings* Settings = FSentryModule::Get().GetSettings();
Settings->AttachScreenshot = true;
```

<Note>

Currently this feature is supported for Windows and Linux only.

## Screenshot Capture Mechanism

Since the Unreal Engine SDK internally consists of multiple SDKs, the mechanism with which a screenshot gets captured depends on where the error originates.

- On Windows/Linux errors from within your game will be captured using Unreal Engine API. This means that screenshots only contain things visible within your game. Overlays on top of your game will not be visible.
- On Apple/Android screenshots are captured using platform APIs. If you're using a native plugin to display an overlay and an error occurs then the SDK will try to capture a screenshot that contains the overlay.

<Note>

Screenshots might contain PII of your app. For example, if your game has a registration form and an error happens while the form is being displayed.
