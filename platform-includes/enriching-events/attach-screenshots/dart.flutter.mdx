Enable screenshots by setting the `attachScreenshot` option to `true` and wrap your root widget with `SentryWidget`.

```dart {3, 6-8}
await SentryFlutter.init(
  (options) {
    options.attachScreenshot = true;
  },
  appRunner: () => runApp(
    SentryWidget(
      child: MyApp(),
    ),
  ),
);
```

## Customize Screenshot Capturing

By default, Flutter limits screenshot captures to once every 2 seconds to minimize performance impact. While this debounce interval cannot be changed, you can customize capture behavior by implementing the `beforeCaptureScreenshot` callback in `SentryFlutter.init`.

This callback gives you fine-grained control over screenshot captures based on event and hint data, allowing you to implement conditional logic.

Return `true` to capture the screenshot, or `false` to skip it.

<Alert>

The `shouldDebounce` flag is set to `true` when debounce is active, meaning it will block the screenshot from being taken.
If you want to capture screenshots regardless of the debounce, you can ignore the `shouldDebounce` flag.

</Alert>

```dart {tabTitle: Respect debounce}
options.beforeCaptureScreenshot = (event, hint, shouldDebounce) async {
  // If shouldDebounce is active, skip capturing
  if (shouldDebounce) {
    return false;
  }
  // Capture screenshot if it's a fatal event
  return event.level == SentryLevel.fatal;
};
```

```dart {tabTitle: Ignore debounce}
options.beforeCaptureScreenshot = (event, hint, shouldDebounce) async {
  // Capture screenshot if it's a fatal event regardless of debounce
  return event.level == SentryLevel.fatal;
};
```

## Redact Screenshots via `masking`

The masking feature is enabled by default for screenshots, but can be disabled or configured by adjusting the `options.privacy` option.
