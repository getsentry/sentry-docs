Enable screenshots by setting the `attachScreenshot` option to `true` and wrap your root widget with `SentryWidget`.

```dart {3, 6-8}
await SentryFlutter.init(
  (options) {
    options.attachScreenshot = true;
  },
  appRunner: () => runApp(
    SentryWidget(
      child: MyApp(),
    ),
  ),
);
```

### Customize Screenshot Capturing

<Alert>

Requires SDK version `8.11.0` or higher.

</Alert>

Capturing screenshots on Flutter is limited to once every 2 seconds by default to minimize performance impact. While this debounce interval is fixed, you can override individual capture decisions by implementing the `beforeCaptureScreenshot` option in your `SentryFlutterOptions`.

The `BeforeCaptureCallback` also allows you to customize the behavior based on event data, so you can decide when to capture a screenshot and when not to. For example, you can decide to only capture screenshots of fatal events:

```flutter {2-9}
await SentryFlutter.init((options) {
  options.beforeCaptureScreenshot = (event, hint, debounce) async {
    // If debounce is active, skip capturing
    if (debounce) {
      return false;
    }
    // Capture if it's a fatal event
    return event.level == SentryLevel.fatal;
  };
});
```

## Redact Screenshots via `masking`

The masking feature is by default disabled for Screenshots. To enable masking, use the `options.experimental.privacy` parameter.

## Filtering Screenshots

You can filter your screenshots by using the `beforeCaptureScreenshot` callback, which is called before attaching a screenshot to an event. By default, the callback returns `true` which means that all screenshots are attached.

If the callback returns `false`, the screenshot will not be attached.

```dart {4-10}
await SentryFlutter.init(
  (options) {
    options.attachScreenshot = true;
    options.beforeScreenshot = (event, {hint}) {
    // Based on some condition you can decide to attach the screenshot or drop it
    if (event.throwable is MyImportantException) {
      return true;
    }
      return false;
    };
  },
  appRunner: () => runApp(
    SentryWidget(
      child: MyApp(),
    ),
  ),
);
```
