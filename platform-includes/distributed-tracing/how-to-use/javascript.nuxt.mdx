If you're using the current version of our Nuxt SDK, distributed tracing will work out of the box for the client and server runtimes.

To get around possible [Browser CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) issues, you should define `tracePropagationTargets` for client-side.

<Alert>

Note: port numbers are relevant for trace propagation and the origin. You may need to configure the `tracePropagationTargets` to ensure that traces are propagated across your services if they run on different ports.

For example, if you have a Node.js backend running locally on port 3000, that destination (`http://localhost:3000`) should be added to the `tracePropagationTargets` array on your frontend to ensure that CORS doesn't restrict the propagation of traces.

</Alert>

```javascript {filename:sentry.client.config.(js|ts)}
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  // Capture 100% of spans. This is useful for development and debugging. Consider reducing in production or using traceSampler
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  tracePropagationTargets: ["https://myproject.org", /^\/api\//],
});
```

#### Example 1: Microservices E-commerce Platform

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  // Capture 100% of spans. This is useful for development and debugging. Consider reducing in production or using traceSampler
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  tracePropagationTargets: [
    "https://api.myecommerce.com",
    "https://auth.myecommerce.com",
  ],
});
```

This tells Sentry to pass trace headers across the following paths:

* Your main API server (where product data comes from)
* Your authentication server (where logins happen)

This way, if a customer experiences an error during checkout, or you want to check the performance of a specific endpoint, you can see the complete path their request took across these different services.

#### Example 2: Mobile App with Backend Services

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  tracePropagationTargets: [
    "https://api.myapp.com",
    "https://media.myapp.com",
    /^\/local-api\//
  ],
});
```

This configuration lets your app track user actions across:

* Your main API server (handles most app functions)
* Your media server (handles images, videos, etc.)
* Any local API endpoints in your app

If your app crashes while a user is uploading a photo, you can trace exactly where the problem occurred - in the app itself, the main API, or the media service.

### Strict Trace Continuation

_Available since SDK version 10_

When your application receives requests, they might include `sentry-trace` and `baggage` headers from an upstream service that is also using Sentry.
By default, the SDK will continue the trace from these incoming headers. However, this behavior can be undesirable if the requests are from a third-party service,
as it can lead to unwanted traces, increased billing, and skewed performance data.

To prevent this, you can enable `strictTraceContinuation`. When this option is set to `true`, the SDK checks the incoming request for Sentry trace information and only continues the trace if it belongs to the same Sentry organization.
Otherwise, it starts a new trace.
This is useful if your application is a public API or receives requests from services outside your organization.

```javascript {5}
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  // Ensure that only traces from your own organization are continued
  strictTraceContinuation: true,
});
```

The SDK automatically parses the organization ID from your DSN. If you use a DSN format that doesn't include the organization ID (number followed by the letter `"o"`), or if you need to override it, you can provide it manually using the `orgId` option:

```javascript {6}
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  strictTraceContinuation: true,
  // Manually provide your organization ID (overrides organization ID parsed from DSN)
  orgId: 12345,
});
```
