Remix SDK attaches `sentry-trace` and `baggage` values from your `root` loader. You need to use the [`meta`](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/api/conventions#meta) function to attach the data from your `loader` as `<meta>` tags. The following code snippet shows how to do this:

```typescript {tabTitle: Remix v1} {filename: root.tsx}
export const meta: MetaFunction = ({ data }) => {
  return {
    // ...
    "sentry-trace": data.sentryTrace,
    baggage: data.sentryBaggage,
  };
};
```

```typescript {tabTitle: Remix v2} {filename: root.tsx}
// Sentry provides a type for Remix v2 MetaFunction parameters
// so you can access `data.sentryTrace` and `data.sentryBaggage` alongside other data from loader.
import type { SentryMetaArgs } from "@sentry/remix";

export const meta = ({ data }: SentryMetaArgs<MetaFunction<typeof loader>>) => {
  return [
    {
      name: "sentry-trace",
      content: data.sentryTrace,
    },
    {
      name: "baggage",
      content: data.sentryBaggage,
    },
  ];
};
```

The `name` attributes must be the strings `"sentry-trace"` and `"baggage"` and the `content` attributes must be generated by your backend Sentry SDK. For `sentry-trace`, use `span.toSentryTrace()` (or equivalent, depending on the backend platform). This guarantees that a new and unique value will be generated for each request. For `baggage`, use `serializeBaggage(span.getBaggage())`.

To get around possible [Browser CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) issues, you should define `tracePropagationTargets` on the client side. See <PlatformLink to="/tracing/trace-propagation/dealing-with-cors-issues/">Dealing with CORS Issues</PlatformLink> for more information.

<Alert>

Note: port numbers are relevant for trace propagation and the origin. You may need to configure the `tracePropagationTargets` to ensure that traces are propagated across your services if they run on different ports. 

For example, if you have a Node.js backend running locally on port 3000, that destination (`http://localhost:3000`) should be added to the `tracePropagationTargets` array on your frontend to ensure that CORS doesn't restrict the propagation of traces.

</Alert>

```javascript
// entry.client.tsx
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [Sentry.browserTracingIntegration()],
  // Capture 100% of spans. This is useful for development and debugging. Consider reducing in production or using traceSampler
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  tracePropagationTargets: ["https://myproject.org", /^\/api\//],
});
```

If you're using version `7.57.x` or below, you'll need to have our <PlatformLink to="/tracing/">tracing feature enabled</PlatformLink> in order for distributed tracing to work.

#### Example 1: Microservices E-commerce Platform

```javascript
// entry.client.tsx
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [Sentry.browserTracingIntegration()],
  // Capture 100% of spans. This is useful for development and debugging. Consider reducing in production or using traceSampler
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  tracePropagationTargets: [
    "https://api.myecommerce.com",
    "https://auth.myecommerce.com",
  ],
});
```

This tells Sentry to pass trace headers across the following paths:

* Your main API server (where product data comes from)
* Your authentication server (where logins happen)

This way, if a customer experiences an error during checkout, or you want to check the performance of a specific endpoint, you can see the complete path their request took across these different services.

#### Example 2: Mobile App with Backend Services

```javascript
// entry.client.tsx
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [Sentry.browserTracingIntegration()],
  tracePropagationTargets: [
    "https://api.myapp.com",
    "https://media.myapp.com",
    /^\/local-api\//
  ],
});
```

This configuration lets your app track user actions across:

* Your main API server (handles most app functions)
* Your media server (handles images, videos, etc.)
* Any local API endpoints in your app

If your app crashes while a user is uploading a photo, you can trace exactly where the problem occurred - in the app itself, the main API, or the media service.

### Disabling Distributed Tracing

If you want to disable distributed tracing and ensure no Sentry trace headers are sent, you can configure your SDK like this:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // Overwrite the defaults to ensure no trace headers are sent
  tracePropagationTargets: [],
});
```
