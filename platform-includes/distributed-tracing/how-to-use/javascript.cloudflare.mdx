The Sentry Cloudflare SDK has out of the box support for distributed tracing if you've setup the SDK to send traces.

### Custom Instrumentation

If you don't want to use tracing, you can set up <PlatformLink to="/tracing/trace-propagation/custom-instrumentation/">Custom Instrumentation</PlatformLink> for distributed tracing.

### Disabling Distributed Tracing

If you want to disable distributed tracing, set the `tracePropagationTargets` option to be an empty array. This will ensure no trace headers are sent.

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // Overwrite the defaults to ensure no trace headers are sent
  tracePropagationTargets: [],
});
```
