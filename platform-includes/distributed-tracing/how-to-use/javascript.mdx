If you're using the current version of our JavaScript SDK and have enabled the `BrowserTracing` integration, distributed tracing will work out of the box. To get around possible [Browser CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) issues, define your `tracePropagationTargets`.

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [Sentry.browserTracingIntegration()],
  tracePropagationTargets: ["https://myproject.org", /^\/api\//],
});
```

### Custom Instrumentation

If you don't want to use performance monitoring, you can set up <PlatformLink to="/distributed-tracing/custom-instrumentation/">Custom Instrumentation</PlatformLink> for distributed tracing.

If you're using version `7.57.x` or below, you'll need to have our <PlatformLink to="/performance/">performance monitoring feature enabled</PlatformLink> in order for distributed tracing to work.

### Disabling Distributed Tracing

If you want to disable distributed tracing and ensure no Sentry trace headers are sent, you can configure your SDK like this:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // Overwrite the defaults to ensure no trace headers are sent
  tracePropagationTargets: [],
});
```
