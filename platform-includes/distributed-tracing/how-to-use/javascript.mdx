If you're using the current version of our JavaScript SDK and have enabled the `BrowserTracing` integration, distributed tracing will work out of the box. To get around possible [Browser CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) issues, define your `tracePropagationTargets`.

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [Sentry.browserTracingIntegration()],
  tracePropagationTargets: ["https://myproject.org", /^\/api\//],
});
```

### Automatic Trace Propagation

By default, the `browserTracingIntegration` will automatically continue a trace found in a `<meta>` tags that look like this:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <meta name="sentry-trace" content="12345678901234567890123456789012-1234567890123456-1" />
    <meta name="sentry-baggage" content="sentry-trace_id=12345678901234567890123456789012,sentry-sample_rate=0.2,sentry-sampled=true,..." />
  </head>
</html>
```

If you want to continue a trace from a server, e.g. in a server rendered application, the server will have to emit these meta tags into the rendered HTML. You do not need to configure anything to continue traces from `<meta>` tags, if you use `browserTracingIntegration`.

### Custom Instrumentation

If you don't want to use `browserTracingIntegration`, you can set up <PlatformLink to="/tracing/trace-propagation/custom-instrumentation/">Custom Instrumentation</PlatformLink> for distributed tracing.

If you're using version `7.57.x` or below, you'll need to have our <PlatformLink to="/tracing/">tracing feature enabled</PlatformLink> in order for distributed tracing to work.

### Disabling Distributed Tracing

If you want to disable distributed tracing and ensure no Sentry trace headers are sent, you can configure your SDK like this:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // Overwrite the defaults to ensure no trace headers are sent
  tracePropagationTargets: [],
});
```
