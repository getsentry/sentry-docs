In version `8.0.0` and above of the Sentry Node SDK, distributed tracing will work out of the box.


```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  tracesSampleRate: 1,
});
```

### Custom Instrumentation

If you don't want to use tracing, you can set up <PlatformLink to="/tracing/trace-propagation/custom-instrumentation/">Custom Instrumentation</PlatformLink> for distributed tracing.

### Disabling Distributed Tracing

If you want to disable distributed tracing and ensure no Sentry trace headers are sent, you can configure your SDK like this:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // Overwrite the defaults to ensure no trace headers are sent
  tracePropagationTargets: [],
});
```
