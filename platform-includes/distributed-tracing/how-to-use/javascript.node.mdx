In version `8.0.0` and above of the Sentry Node SDK, distributed tracing will work out of the box.

<SignInNote />

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  tracesSampleRate: 1,
});
```

### Custom Instrumentation

If you don't want to use performance monitoring, you can set up <PlatformLink to="/distributed-tracing/custom-instrumentation/">Custom Instrumentation</PlatformLink> for distributed tracing.
