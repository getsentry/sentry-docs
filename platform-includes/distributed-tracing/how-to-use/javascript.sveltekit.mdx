If you're using the current version of our SvelteKit SDK, distributed tracing will work out of the box for the client and server runtimes. To get around possible [Browser CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) issues, you should define `tracePropagationTargets` for client-side.

```javascript
// hooks.client.js
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [Sentry.browserTracingIntegration()],
  tracePropagationTargets: ["https://myproject.org", /^\/api\//],
});
```

If you're using version `7.57.x` or below, you'll need to have our <PlatformLink to="/tracing/">tracing feature enabled</PlatformLink> for distributed tracing to work.
