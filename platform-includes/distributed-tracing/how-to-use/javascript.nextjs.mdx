If you're using the current version of our Next.js SDK, distributed tracing will work out of the box for the client, server, and edge runtimes.

For client-side you might have to define `tracePropagationTargets` to get around possible [Browser CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) issues.

```javascript
// sentry.client.config.js
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [Sentry.browserTracingIntegration()],
  tracePropagationTargets: ["https://myproject.org", /^\/api\//],
});
```

If you're using version `7.57.x` or below, you'll need to have our <PlatformLink to="/performance/">performance monitoring feature enabled</PlatformLink> in order for distributed tracing to work.

### Disabling Distributed Tracing

If you want to disable distributed tracing and ensure no Sentry trace headers are sent, you can configure your SDK like this:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // Overwrite the defaults to ensure no trace headers are sent
  tracePropagationTargets: [],
});
```
