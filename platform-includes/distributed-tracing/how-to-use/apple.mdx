If you're using the current version of our Cocoa SDK, distributed tracing will work out of the box.

If you're using version `8.10.x` or below, you'll need to have our <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#network-tracking">Network Tracking feature enabled</PlatformLink> in order for distributed tracing to work.
