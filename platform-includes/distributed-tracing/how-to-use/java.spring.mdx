If you use the current version of our Java SDK, distributed tracing works automatically without additional configuration.

If you use SDK version `6.24.x` or below, you need to <PlatformLink to="/performance/">Set Up Performance</PlatformLink> monitoring for distributed tracing to work. If you do not want to use performance monitoring, you can instead set up <PlatformLink to="/usage/distributed-tracing/custom-instrumentation/">Custom Instrumentation</PlatformLink> for distributed tracing.
