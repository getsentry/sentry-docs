If you're using our Astro SDK, distributed tracing will work out of the box for the client and server runtimes.
To get around possible [Browser CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) issues, you should define `tracePropagationTargets` on the client-side.

```javascript
// sentry.client.config.js
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [Sentry.browserTracingIntegration()],
  tracePropagationTargets: ["https://myproject.org", /^\/api\//],
});
```
