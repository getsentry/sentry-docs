To set up distributed tracing, use Sentry's middleware to inject tracing information into meta tags.

Create or modify the `middleware.ts` file and import and add `sentryBeforeResponseMiddleware`

```typescript {filename: middleware.ts}
import { sentryBeforeResponseMiddleware } from '@sentry/solidstart/middleware';
import { createMiddleware } from '@solidjs/start/middleware';

export default createMiddleware({
  onBeforeResponse: [
    sentryBeforeResponseMiddleware(),
    // Add your other middleware handlers after `sentryBeforeResponseMiddleware`
  ],
});
````

If you didn't use a middleware before, don't forget to specify it in `app.config.ts`

```typescript {filename: app.config.ts}
import { defineConfig } from '@solidjs/start/config';

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  middleware: './src/middleware.ts',
});
```

To get around possible [Browser CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) issues, you should define `tracePropagationTargets` for client-side.

```javascript
// hooks.client.js
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [Sentry.solidRouterBrowserTracingIntegration()],
  // Capture 100% of spans. This is useful for development and debugging. Consider reducing in production or using traceSampler
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  tracePropagationTargets: ["https://myproject.org", /^\/api\//],
});
```

### Trace Propagation Examples

#### Example 1: Microservices E-commerce Platform

```javascript
// hooks.client.js
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [Sentry.solidRouterBrowserTracingIntegration()],
  // Capture 100% of spans. This is useful for development and debugging. Consider reducing in production or using traceSampler
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  tracePropagationTargets: [
    "https://api.myecommerce.com",
    "https://auth.myecommerce.com",
    /^\/internal-api\//
  ],
});
```

This tells Sentry to track user journeys across three places:

* Your main API server (where product data comes from)
* Your authentication server (where logins happen)
* Any API calls that start with "/internal-api/" on your current domain

This way, if a customer experiences an error during checkout, you can see the complete path their request took across these different services.

#### Example 2: Mobile App with Backend Services

```javascript
// hooks.client.js
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [Sentry.solidRouterBrowserTracingIntegration()],
  tracePropagationTargets: [
    "https://api.myapp.com",
    "https://media.myapp.com",
    /^\/local-api\//
  ],
});
```

This configuration lets your app track user actions across:

* Your main API server (handles most app functions)
* Your media server (handles images, videos, etc.)
* Any local API endpoints in your app

If your app crashes while a user is uploading a photo, you can trace exactly where the problem occurred - in the app itself, the main API, or the media service.
