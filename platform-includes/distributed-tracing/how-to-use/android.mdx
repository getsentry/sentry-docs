For Sentry Android SDK versions `6.25.x` and higher, distributed tracing works out of the box for any HTTP request sent with OkHttp, Apollo, or Apollo 3, if the integration for it is enabled.
If you use SDK version `6.24.x` or below, you need to follow the <PlatformLink to="/tracing/trace-propagation/custom-instrumentation/">Custom Instrumentation</PlatformLink> set up steps.
