If you use the current version of our Python SDK, [distributed tracing](/platforms/python/usage/distributed-tracing/#how-to-use-distributed-tracing) works out of the box for the following frameworks:

- Django
- FastAPI
- Flask
- Bottle
- Falcon
- Pyramid
- Quart
- Starlette
- Tornado

However, if you use version `1.25.x` or below, you need to have our <PlatformLink to="/performance/">performance monitoring feature enabled</PlatformLink> for distributed tracing to work. If you don't want to activate performance monitoring, you can also setup a <PlatformLink to="/usage/distributed-tracing/custom-instrumentation/">custom instrumentation</PlatformLink>.
