If you use the current version of our Java SDK, distributed tracing works automatically with the following frameworks:

- [Spring](/platforms/java/guides/spring/distributed-tracing/#how-to-use-distributed-tracing)
- [Spring Boot](/platforms/java/guides/spring-boot/distributed-tracing/#how-to-use-distributed-tracing)

If you use SDK version `6.24.x` or below, you need to <PlatformLink to="/tracing/">Set Up Performance</PlatformLink> monitoring for distributed tracing to work. If you do not want to use tracing, you can instead set up <PlatformLink to="/tracing/trace-propagation/custom-instrumentation/">Custom Instrumentation</PlatformLink> for distributed tracing.
