Distributed tracing connects and records the path of requests as they travel through your distributed system, creating a comprehensive timeline of events that would otherwise be fragmented across different components. 

This end-to-end visibility allows developers to identify bottlenecks, pinpoint the root cause of errors, and understand component interactionsâ€”turning what would be a complex debugging nightmare into a manageable process that improves system reliability and performance.
