Distributed tracing connects and records the path of requests as they travel through the different tiers of your application architecture. If your architecture consists of multiple services that live on different sub-domains (e.g. `fe.example.com` and `api.example.com`), distributed tracing will help you follow the path of events as they move from one service to another.

This end-to-end visibility allows developers to identify bottlenecks, pinpoint the root cause of errors, and understand component interactionsâ€”turning what would be a complex debugging nightmare into a manageable process that improves system reliability and performance.
