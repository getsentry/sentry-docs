Distributed tracing will be set up automatically if you've <PlatformLink to="/tracing/">set up tracing</PlatformLink>.

  <PlatformContent includePath="distributed-tracing/explanation" />
</Expandable>

When tracing is enabled, the Sentry SDK will not only create spans for pageloads and transactions but also propagate trace information to other systems. This allows you to connect multiple systems and see how they interact with each other.

By default, outgoing HTTP requests will automatically be instrumented for you. For other cases where you may want to continue traces (for example when working with websockets), you can manually extract and inject tracing information.

## Enabling Automatic Distributed Tracing

To enable distributed tracing for your frontend, add `browserTracingIntegration` to your `Sentry.init()` options as described in the <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/">Automatic Instrumentation</PlatformLink> docs.

### Continuing a Trace Manually

By default, the `browserTracingIntegration` will automatically continue a trace found in a `<meta>` tag - see <PlatformLink to="/tracing/trace-propagation/#automatic-trace-propagation">Automatic Trace Propagation</PlatformLink> for details.
If you want to continue a different trace, for example because you cannot propagate the trace through meta tags but through some different mechanism, you can do this:

```javascript
const client = Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    Sentry.browserTracingIntegration({
      // Disable default pageload instrumentation
      instrumentPageLoad: false,
    }),
  ],
});

// Start the pageload span manually
const sentryTrace = getSentryTraceStringFromSomewhere();
const baggage = getBaggageStringFromSomewhere();

Sentry.startBrowserTracingPageLoadSpan(
  client,
  {
    name: window.location.pathname,
  },
  { sentryTrace, baggage }
);
```

## Configuring Distributed Tracing Without `browserTracingIntegration`

If you don't want to use the `browserTracingIntegration` integration, or you want to propagate traces in other places than HTTP requests (for example, with websockets), you can manually extract and inject tracing data in your application to connect multiple systems. For this, you must:

- Extract and store incoming tracing information from HTML `<meta>` tags when loading the page.
- Inject tracing information to any outgoing requests.

To learn more about distributed tracing, see our <PlatformLink to="/tracing/trace-propagation/">Distributed Tracing</PlatformLink> docs.

### Extract Tracing Information From HTML `meta` Tags

If you have a server that renders your application's HTML (server-side rendering) and is also running a Sentry SDK, you can connect your backend to your backend via tracing.

To do this, have your server render HTML `<meta>` tags with the Sentry trace information. In your frontend, extract that tracing information when the page is loading and use it to create new transactions connected to that incoming backend trace.

Some Sentry backend SDKs provide a built-in way to inject these `<meta>` tags into rendered HTML. For example:

- [Node](/platforms/javascript/guides/node/tracing/trace-propagation/custom-instrumentation/#injecting-tracing-information-into-html)
- [Python](/platforms/python/distributed-tracing/custom-instrumentation/#inject-tracing-information-into-rendered-html)
- [Ruby](/platforms/ruby/distributed-tracing/custom-instrumentation/#inject-tracing-information-into-rendered-html)
- [PHP](/platforms/php/distributed-tracing/custom-instrumentation/#inject-tracing-information-into-rendered-html)

Then, on `pageload` you can do the following:

```javascript
import { propagationContextFromHeaders } from "@sentry/core"; // Before version 8.40.0, import from "@sentry/utils"
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";

// Read meta tag values
const sentryTrace = document.querySelector("meta[name=sentry-trace]")?.content;
const baggage = document.querySelector("meta[name=baggage]")?.content;

// Generate a propagation context from the meta tags
const propagationContext = propagationContextFromHeaders(sentryTrace, baggage);
Sentry.getCurrentScope().setPropagationContext(propagationContext);

Sentry.startSpan(
  {
    name: `Pageload: ${window.location.pathname}`,
    op: "pageload",
  },
  () => {
    // do something
  }
);
```

In this example, we create a new root span that is attached to the trace specified in the `sentry-trace` and `baggage` HTML `<meta>` tags.
