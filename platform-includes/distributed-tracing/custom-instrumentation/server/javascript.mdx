Trace propagation is set up automatically in this SDK. By default, outgoing HTTP requests will automatically be instrumented for you.
For other cases where you may want to continue traces (for example, in a job queue or when working with websockets), you can manually extract and inject tracing information.

## Manually Extracting and Injecting Distributed Tracing Information

You can also manually extract and inject tracing data into your application. For this, you must:

- Extract and store incoming tracing information from incoming request headers or similar.
- Inject tracing information to any outgoing requests.

To learn more about distributed tracing, see our <PlatformLink to="/tracing/trace-propagation/">Distributed Tracing</PlatformLink> docs.

### Extracting Incoming Tracing Information

You must extract and store incoming tracing information in memory for later use. Sentry provides the `continueTrace()` function to help you with this. Incoming tracing information can come from different places:

- In a web environment, it's sent with HTTP headers, for example, by another Sentry SDK used in your frontend project.
- In a job queue, it can be retrieved from meta or header variables.
- You also can pick up tracing information from environment variables.

Here's an example of how to extract and store incoming tracing information using `continueTrace()`:

```javascript
const http = require("http");

http.createServer((request, response) => {
  const sentryTrace = request.headers["sentry-trace"];
  const baggage = request.headers["baggage"];

  Sentry.continueTrace({ sentryTrace, baggage }, () => {
    Sentry.startSpan(
      {,
        name: "my request",
        op: "http.server",
      },
      () => {
        // Your API code...
      }
    );
  });
});
```

In this example, we create a new transaction that is attached to the trace specified in the `sentry-trace` and `baggage` headers.

### Injecting Tracing Information Into HTML

If you're server-side rendering HTML and you use a Sentry SDK in your browser application, you can connect the backend and frontend traces by injecting your server's tracing information as `<meta>` tags into the HTML that's initially served to the browser. When the frontend SDK is initialized, it will automatically pick up the tracing information from the `<meta>` tags and continue the trace. Note, that your browser SDK needs to register `browserTracingIntegration` for this to work.

The easiest and recommended way to do this is to use the `Sentry.getTraceMetaTags()`:

```javascript {5} {filename:index.js}
function renderHtml() {
  return `
    <html>
      <head>
        ${Sentry.getTraceMetaTags()}
      </head>
      <body>
        <!-- Your HTML content -->
      </body>
    </html>
  `;
}
```

Alternatively, if you need more control over how meta tags are generated, you can use `Sentry.getTraceData()` to get only the meta tag values and generate the meta tags yourself:

```javascript {2, 7-8} {filename:index.js}
function renderHtml() {
  const metaTagValues = Sentry.getTraceData();

  return `
    <html>
      <head>
        <meta name="sentry-trace" content="${metaTagValues["sentry-trace"]}">
        <meta name="baggage" content="${metaTagValues.baggage}">
      </head>
      <body>
        <!-- Your HTML content -->
      </body>
    </html>
  `;
}
```
