On this page you will learn how to manually propagate trace information into and out of your Native application.

To obtain trace headers from a transaction, use `sentry_transaction_iter_headers()`. For a span, use `sentry_span_iter_headers()`. Pass the returned value to the downstream service. If communication happens over HTTP, we recommend you attach all headers to the outgoing HTTP request.

By default, only the `sentry-trace` header is generated. To also generate W3C `traceparent` headers for interoperability with other tracing systems, enable traceparent propagation:

```c
sentry_options_set_propagate_traceparent(options, 1);
```

When enabled, both `sentry-trace` and `traceparent` headers will be generated with the same trace and span information.

Continuing a trace from an upstream service requires using `sentry_transaction_context_update_from_header()`. Before starting a transaction, pass its transaction context into the previous function along with the `sentry-trace` header. The transaction started with the transaction context will contain everything needed to continue the trace.

To obtain headers from a transaction so it can be continued from a downstream service, define a function which merges the headers into some aggregate object. Use the function in `sentry_transaction_iter_headers()` as a callback. The following example uses `sentry_value_t` as the aggregate object:

```c
static void
copy_headers_to(const char *key, const char *value, void *userdata) {
    sentry_value_t *headers = (sentry_value_t *)userdata;
    sentry_value_set_by_key(*headers, key, sentry_value_new_string(value));
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    sentry_options_t *options = sentry_options_new();
    sentry_options_set_dsn(options, "___PUBLIC_DSN___");

    // Enable traceparent propagation for W3C compatibility
    sentry_options_set_propagate_traceparent(options, 1);

    sentry_init(options);

    // Transaction to continue off of
    sentry_transaction_context_t *tx_ctx = sentry_transaction_context_new(
        "honk",
        NULL
    );
    sentry_transaction_t *tx = sentry_transaction_start(tx_ctx, sentry_value_new_null());

    sentry_value_t headers = sentry_value_new_object();
    sentry_transaction_iter_headers(tx, copy_headers_to, (void *) &headers);

    // The headers object now contains both "sentry-trace" and "traceparent"
    // (if traceparent propagation is enabled)
    // Example values:
    // - "sentry-trace": "2674eb52d5874b13b560236d6c79ce8a-a0f9fdf04f1a63df-1"
    // - "traceparent": "00-2674eb52d5874b13b560236d6c79ce8a-a0f9fdf04f1a63df-01"

    sentry_transaction_finish(tx);
    sentry_close();
}
```

The key differences in the generated headers are:
- `sentry-trace`: Uses Sentry's format with sampling flag as "0" or "1"
- `traceparent`: Uses W3C format with version "00" and sampling flag as "00" or "01"

Both headers contain the same trace ID and span ID, ensuring compatibility across different tracing systems.


To create a transaction as a continuation of a trace retrieved from an upstream service, pass an iterator of the incoming headers to the transaction context:

```c
	sentry_transaction_context_t *tx_ctx = sentry_transaction_context_new(
        "honk",
        NULL
    );
    sentry_transaction_context_update_from_header(
        tx_ctx,
        "sentry-trace",
        "41c74c2ea9f2bfb184f86939de5b97aa-399b3e5cc8b83494-1"
    );

```

The format of the `sentry-trace` header should follow the one defined in [the telemetry docs](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/telemetry/traces/#header-sentry-trace). It should consist of a 32 character hexadecimal string for the `traceId`, followed by a 16 character hexadecimal string for the `spanId` and an optional single character for the `sampled` flag. If the given string doesn't match this format, the update is ignored and the values in the transaction context will remain unchanged.
