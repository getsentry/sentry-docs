On this page you will learn how to manually propagate trace information into and out of your JavaScript application.

Distributed tracing will be set up automatically if:

- You've <PlatformLink to="/tracing/">Set Up Tracing</PlatformLink>, or
- You're using one of the SDKs that include tracing propagation out of the box:
  - `@sentry/nextjs`
  - `@sentry/sveltekit`
  - `@sentry/remix`
  - `@sentry/astro`

If you are using a different package, and have not enabled tracing, you can manually set up your application for distributed tracing to work.

## Enabling Distributed Tracing

<PlatformCategorySection supported={['browser']}>

To enable distributed tracing for your frontend, add the `BrowserTracing` integration to your `Sentry.init()` options as described in the <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/">Automatic Instrumentation</PlatformLink> docs.

If you want to use distributed tracing but not tracing, set the `tracesSampleRate` option to `0`.

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [Sentry.browserTracingIntegration()],

  // If this is 0, tracing is disabled
  // but distributed tracing is not
  tracesSampleRate: 0,
});
```

## Enabling Distributed Tracing without `BrowserTracing`

If you don't want to use the `BrowserTracing` integration, you can manually extract and inject tracing data in your application to connect multiple systems. For this, you must:

- Extract and store incoming tracing information from HTML `<meta>` tags when loading the page.
- Inject tracing information to any outgoing requests.

To learn more about distributed tracing, see our <PlatformLink to="/tracing/trace-propagation/">Distributed Tracing</PlatformLink> docs.

### Extract Tracing Information From HTML `meta` Tags

If you have a server that renders your application's HTML (SSR) and is also running a Sentry SDK, you can connect your backend to your backend via tracing.

To do this, have your server render HTML `<meta>` tags with the Sentry trace information. In your frontend, extract that tracing information when the page is loading and use it to create new transactions connected to that incoming backend trace.

Some Sentry backend SDKs provide a built-in way to inject these `<meta>` tags into rendered HTML. For example:

- [Python](/platforms/python/distributed-tracing/custom-instrumentation/#inject-tracing-information-into-rendered-html)
- [Ruby](/platforms/ruby/distributed-tracing/custom-instrumentation/#inject-tracing-information-into-rendered-html)
- [PHP](/platforms/php/distributed-tracing/custom-instrumentation/#inject-tracing-information-into-rendered-html)

Then, on `pageload` you can do the following:

```javascript
// Read meta tag values
const sentryTrace = document.querySelector("meta[name=sentry-trace]")?.content;
const baggage = document.querySelector("meta[name=baggage]")?.content;

Sentry.continueTrace({ sentryTrace, baggage }, (transactionContext) => {
  Sentry.startSpan(
    {
      ...transactionContext,
      name: `Pageload: ${window.location.pathname}`,
      op: "pageload",
    },
    () => {
      // do something
    }
  );
});
```

In this example, we create a new transaction that is attached to the trace specified in the `sentry-trace` and `baggage` HTML `<meta>` tags.

</PlatformCategorySection>

<PlatformCategorySection supported={['server', 'serverless']}>
If you want to use distributed tracing but not tracing, set the `tracesSampleRate` option to `0`.

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // If this is 0, tracing is disabled
  // but distributed tracing is not
  tracesSampleRate: 0,
});
```

## Manually Extracting and Injecting Distributed Tracing Information

You can also manually extract and inject tracing data into your application. For this, you must:

- Extract and store incoming tracing information from incoming request headers or similar.
- Inject tracing information to any outgoing requests.

To learn more about distributed tracing, see our <PlatformLink to="/tracing/trace-propagation/">Distributed Tracing</PlatformLink> docs.

### Extracting Incoming Tracing Information

You must extract and store incoming tracing information in memory for later use. Sentry provides the `continueTrace()` function to help you with this. Incoming tracing information can come from different places:

- In a web environment, it's sent with HTTP headers, for example, by another Sentry SDK used in your frontend project.
- In a job queue, it can be retrieved from meta or header variables.
- You also can pick up tracing information from environment variables.

Here's an example of how to extract and store incoming tracing information using `continueTrace()`:

```javascript
const http = require("http");

http.createServer((request, response) => {
  const sentryTraceHeaders = request.headers["sentry-trace"];
  const sentryTrace = Array.isArray(sentryTraceHeaders)
    ? sentryTraceHeaders.join(",")
    : sentryTraceHeaders;
  const baggage = request.headers["baggage"];

  Sentry.continueTrace({ sentryTrace, baggage }, (transactionContext) => {
    Sentry.startSpan(
      {
        ...transactionContext,
        name: "my request",
        op: "http.server",
      },
      () => {
        // Your API code...
      }
    );
  });
});
```

In this example, we create a new transaction that is attached to the trace specified in the `sentry-trace` and `baggage` headers.

</PlatformCategorySection>

### Inject Tracing Information to Outgoing Requests

For distributed tracing to work, the two headers that you extracted and stored in the active root span, `sentry-trace` and `baggage`, must be added to outgoing HTTP requests.

Here's an example of how to collect and inject this tracing information to outgoing requests:

```javascript
const activeSpan = Sentry.getActiveSpan();
const rootSpan = activeSpan ? Sentry.getRootSpan(activeSpan) : undefined;

// Create `sentry-trace` header
const sentryTraceHeader = rootSpan
  ? Sentry.spanToTraceHeader(rootSpan)
  : undefined;

// Create `baggage` header
const sentryBaggageHeader = rootSpan
  ? Sentry.spanToBaggageHeader(rootSpan)
  : undefined;

// Make outgoing request
fetch("https://example.com", {
  method: "GET",
  headers: {
    baggage: sentryBaggageHeader,
    "sentry-trace": sentryTraceHeader,
  },
}).then((response) => {
  // ...
});
```

In this example, tracing information is propagated to the project running at `https://example.com`. If this project uses a Sentry SDK, it will extract and save the tracing information for later use.

The two services are now connected with your custom distributed tracing implementation.

## Verification

If you make outgoing requests from your project to other services, check if the headers `sentry-trace` and `baggage` are present in the request. If so, distributed tracing is working.
