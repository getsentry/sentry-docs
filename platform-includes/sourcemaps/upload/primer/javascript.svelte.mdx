To upload your Svelte project's source maps to Sentry, you currently have two options:

- Use the [Sentry Vite plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/vite-plugin) to set releases and upload source maps.
- Upload source maps manually using [Sentry-CLI](./cli/). Take a look at this [bash script](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/tree/master/packages/svelte#sourcemaps-and-releases) as an example of how to configure the CLI for a typical Svelte project.

For other bundlers or more advanced configurations, take a look at the following guides and options for uploading sourcemaps:
