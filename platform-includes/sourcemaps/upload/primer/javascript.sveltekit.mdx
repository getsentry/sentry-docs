### Source Maps Upload

By default, the `sentrySvelteKit()` Vite plugin uploads source maps for both server and client builds. This means that when you run a production build (`npm run build`), source maps will be generated and uploaded to Sentry so that you get readable stack traces in your Sentry issues.

However, you still need to specify your Sentry auth token as well as your org and project slugs.
There are two ways to set them:

**Option 1**

You can set all values as environment variables, for example, in a `.env` file:

<OrgAuthTokenNote />

```bash {filename: .env}
# DO NOT commit this file to your repo. The auth token is a secret.
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=___ORG_AUTH_TOKEN___
SENTRY_ORG=___ORG_SLUG___
SENTRY_PROJECT=___PROJECT_SLUG___
# SENTRY_URL is only necessary if you're using a self-hosted Sentry
# instance (as opposed to `https://sentry.io`)
SENTRY_URL="https://your-sentry-instance.com"
```

**Option 2**

You can also set your org and project slugs by passing a `sourceMapsUploadOptions` object to `sentrySvelteKit`, as seen in the example below. For a full list of available options, see the [Sentry Vite Plugin documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/vite-plugin#options).

```javascript {filename:vite.config.(js|ts)} {6-12}
import { sveltekit } from "@sveltejs/kit/vite";
import { sentrySvelteKit } from "@sentry/sveltekit";

export default {
  plugins: [
    sentrySvelteKit({
      org: "___ORG_SLUG___",
      project: "___PROJECT_SLUG___",
      authToken: process.env.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN,
      // If you're self-hosting Sentry, also add your instance URL:
      // url: "https://your-self-hosted-sentry.com/",
    }),
    sveltekit(),
  ],
  // ... rest of your Vite config
};
```

To keep your auth token secure, always store it in an environment variable instead of directly in your files:

<OrgAuthTokenNote />

```bash {filename:.env}
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=___ORG_AUTH_TOKEN___
```

### Override SvelteKit Adapter Detection

By default, `sentrySvelteKit` will try to detect your SvelteKit adapter to configure the source maps upload correctly. If you're not using one of the [supported adapters](/platforms/javascript/guides/sveltekit) or the wrong one is detected, you can override the adapter detection by passing the `adapter` option to `sentrySvelteKit`:

```javascript {filename:vite.config.(js|ts)} {7}
import { sveltekit } from "@sveltejs/kit/vite";
import { sentrySvelteKit } from "@sentry/sveltekit";

export default {
  plugins: [
    sentrySvelteKit({
      adapter: "vercel",
    }),
    sveltekit(),
  ],
  // ... rest of your Vite config
};
```

### Disable Source Maps Upload

You can disable automatic source maps upload in your Vite config:

```javascript {filename:vite.config.(js|ts)} {7}
import { sveltekit } from "@sveltejs/kit/vite";
import { sentrySvelteKit } from "@sentry/sveltekit";

export default {
  plugins: [
    sentrySvelteKit({
      autoUploadSourceMaps: false,
    }),
    sveltekit(),
  ],
  // ... rest of your Vite config
};
```

If you disable automatic source maps upload, you must explicitly set a `release` value in your `Sentry.init()` configuration. This is important for Sentry features like release health and correctly associating errors with specific deployments.
