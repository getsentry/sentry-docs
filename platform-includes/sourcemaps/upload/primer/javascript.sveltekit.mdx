### Source Maps Upload

By default, `sentrySvelteKit()` will add an instance of the Sentry Vite Plugin, to upload source maps for both server and client builds. This means that when you run a production build (`npm run build`), source maps will be generated and uploaded to Sentry so that you get readable stack traces in your Sentry issues.

However, you still need to specify your Sentry auth token as well as your org and project slugs.
There are two ways to set them:

**Option 1**

You can set them as environment variables, for example, in a `.env` file:

- `SENTRY_ORG` your Sentry org slug
- `SENTRY_PROJECT` your Sentry project slug
- `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` your Sentry auth token (can be obtained from the [Organization Token Settings](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/settings/auth-tokens/))
- `SENTRY_URL` your Sentry instance URL. This is only required if you use your own Sentry instance (as opposed to `https://sentry.io`).

**Option 2:**

You can also set them by passing a `sourceMapsUploadOptions` object to `sentrySvelteKit`, as seen in the example below. For a full list of available options, see the [Sentry Vite Plugin documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/vite-plugin#options).

<OrgAuthTokenNote />

```javascript {filename:vite.config.(js|ts)} {6-12}
import { sveltekit } from "@sveltejs/kit/vite";
import { sentrySvelteKit } from "@sentry/sveltekit";

export default {
  plugins: [
    sentrySvelteKit({
      sourceMapsUploadOptions: {
        org: "___ORG_SLUG___",
        project: "___PROJECT_SLUG___",
        authToken: "___ORG_AUTH_TOKEN___",
        // If you're self-hosting Sentry, also add your instance URL:
        // url: "https://your-self-hosted-sentry.com/",
      },
    }),
    sveltekit(),
  ],
  // ... rest of your Vite config
};
```

### Override SvelteKit Adapter Detection

By default, `sentrySvelteKit` will try to detect your SvelteKit adapter to configure the source maps upload correctly. If you're not using one of the [supported adapters](/platforms/javascript/guides/sveltekit) or the wrong one is detected, you can override the adapter detection by passing the `adapter` option to `sentrySvelteKit`:

```javascript {filename:vite.config.(js|ts)} {7}
import { sveltekit } from "@sveltejs/kit/vite";
import { sentrySvelteKit } from "@sentry/sveltekit";

export default {
  plugins: [
    sentrySvelteKit({
      adapter: "vercel",
    }),
    sveltekit(),
  ],
  // ... rest of your Vite config
};
```

### Disable Source Maps Upload

You can disable automatic source maps upload in your Vite config:

```javascript {filename:vite.config.(js|ts)} {7}
import { sveltekit } from "@sveltejs/kit/vite";
import { sentrySvelteKit } from "@sentry/sveltekit";

export default {
  plugins: [
    sentrySvelteKit({
      autoUploadSourceMaps: false,
    }),
    sveltekit(),
  ],
  // ... rest of your Vite config
};
```

If you disable automatic source maps upload, you must explicitly set a `release` value in your `Sentry.init()` configuration. This is important for Sentry features like release health and correctly associating errors with specific deployments.
