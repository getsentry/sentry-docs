To upload your Angular project's source maps to Sentry, we recommend one of these options:

- [**Angular CLI and Sentry webpack plugin**](./angular-webpack/) <br/>
  Use the Angular CLI, a custom Angular builder and the Sentry webpack plugin to set releases and upload source maps automatically when running `ng build`.
- [**Nx Angular CLI and Sentry webpack plugin**](./angular-nx/) <br/>
  If you're using Nx, use `@nx/angular` CLI and the Sentry webpack plugin to set releases and upload source maps automatically when running `nx build`.
- [**Sentry CLI**](./cli/)<br/>
  Upload source maps manually using Sentry CLI.

These options work well with Angular projects out of the box. For other bundlers or more advanced projects and configurations, take a look at the following guides and options for uploading sourcemaps:
