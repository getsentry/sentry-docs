`@sentry/sveltekit` will generate and upload source maps automatically, so that errors in Sentry will contain readable stack traces.

The SvelteKit SDK uses the Sentry Vite Plugin to upload source maps. See the [Sentry Vite Plugin documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/vite-plugin#options) for all available options.
