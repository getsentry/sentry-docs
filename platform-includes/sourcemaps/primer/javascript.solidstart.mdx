`@sentry/solidstart` will generate and upload source maps automatically during production builds, so that errors in Sentry contain readable stack traces.

The easiest way to configure uploading source maps is by using the [Sentry Wizard](/platforms/javascript/guides/solidstart/#step-1-install).

```bash
npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i solidstart
```

The SolidStart SDK uses the Sentry Vite Plugin under the hood to upload source maps. See the [Vite plugin documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/vite-plugin/#configuration) for more details.

**Note:** Source maps are only generated and uploaded during **production builds** (`npm run build`). Development builds (`npm run dev`) do not generate source maps for upload.

See how uploading source maps lets you see the exact line of code that caused an error:
