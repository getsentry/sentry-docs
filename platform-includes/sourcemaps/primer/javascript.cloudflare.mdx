To enable readable stack traces in your Sentry errors, you need to upload your source maps to Sentry.

The easiest way to configure uploading source maps is by using the [Sentry Wizard](/platforms/javascript/guides/cloudflare/sourcemaps/#uploading-source-maps).

```bash
npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i sourcemaps
```

**Note:** Source maps are only generated and uploaded during **production builds** (`wrangler deploy`). Development builds (`wrangler dev`) do not generate source maps for upload.

See how uploading source maps lets you see the exact line of code that caused an error:

If you are using plain Cloudflare Workers, set `upload_source_maps = true` in your `wrangler.jsonc`/`wrangler.toml` config file to enable source map generation.

```jsonc {tabTitle:JSON} {filename:wrangler.jsonc}
{
  "upload_source_maps": true,
}
```

```toml {tabTitle:Toml} {filename:wrangler.toml}
upload_source_maps = true
```

For more detailed configuration options, see the [Cloudflare Workers guide](/platforms/javascript/sourcemaps/uploading/wrangler/).
