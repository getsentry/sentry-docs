If you are using plain Cloudflare Workers, set `upload_source_maps = true` in your `wrangler.jsonc`/`wrangler.toml` config file to enable source map generation.

```jsonc {tabTitle:JSON} {filename:wrangler.jsonc}
{

```

```toml {tabTitle:Toml} {filename:wrangler.toml}
upload_source_maps = true
```
