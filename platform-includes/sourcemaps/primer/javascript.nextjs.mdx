`@sentry/nextjs` will generate and upload source maps automatically. You must have source maps enabled in order to have readable stack traces.

The easiest way to configure uploading source maps is by using the [Sentry Wizard](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/#step-1-install).

The `@sentry/nextjs` SDK uses the Sentry webpack plugin under the hood to upload source maps. See the [Build Options](../configuration/build/#source-maps-options) page and the Sentry [webpack plugin documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/webpack-plugin) for more details. If you are using Vercel, then you can also use the [Vercel integration](/organization/integrations/deployment/vercel/) to upload source maps during deployments automatically.

**Note:** Source maps are only generated and uploaded during **production builds** (`next build`). Development builds (`next dev`) do not generate source maps for upload.
