Source maps translate minified production code back to your original source, giving you readable stack traces instead of cryptic line numbers.

**The SDK handles this automatically.** When you run `next build`, source maps are generated and uploaded to Sentry. No extra configuration needed if you used the [Sentry Wizard](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/#step-1-install).

<Alert level="info">
Source maps are only uploaded during **production builds** (`next build`). Development builds (`next dev`) don't generate uploads.
</Alert>

**Deploying with Vercel?** You can also use the [Vercel integration](/organization/integrations/deployment/vercel/) for automatic uploads during deployment.
