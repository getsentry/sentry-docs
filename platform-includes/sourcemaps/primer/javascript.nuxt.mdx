`@sentry/nuxt` will generate and upload source maps automatically, so that errors in Sentry will contain readable stack traces. You just need to provide your Sentry auth token and your organization and project slugs.

The Nuxt SDK uses the [Sentry Vite Plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/vite-plugin/v/2.14.2) to upload source maps. See the <PlatformLink to="/manual-setup/#source-maps-upload">Manual Configuration</PlatformLink> page and the Sentry [Vite documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/vite-plugin/v/2.14.2#configuration) for more details.
