Currently the Sentry TanStack Start SDK does not upload source maps automatically. This will change in the future.

{/* TODO(lforst): When TSS automatically uploads sourcemaps remove the CLI page from the supported list */}

For now, please use the [Sentry Vite Plugin (recommended)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/vite-plugin/) or <PlatformLink to="/sourcemaps/uploading/cli/">Sentry CLI (more flexible)</PlatformLink> to upload sourcemaps.

**Note:** Source maps are only generated and uploaded during **production builds** (`npm run build`). Development builds (`npm run dev`) do not generate source maps for upload.

See how uploading source maps lets you see the exact line of code that caused an error:
