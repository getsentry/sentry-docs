## Uploading Source Maps in an Angular project

### Automatic Setup

The easiest way to configure uploading source maps is by using the Sentry Wizard:

<Include name="sourcemaps-wizard-instructions.mdx" />

### Manual Setup

If you want to configure source maps upload with Angular manually, follow the steps below.

#### Generating Source Maps

To generate source maps, you need to add the `sourceMap` option to your `angular.json` build configuration:

```json {filename:angular.json}
{
  // ...
  "projects": {
    "my-app": {
      "architect": {
        "build": {
          "configurations": {
            "production": {
              "sourceMap": {
                "scripts": true
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<Alert>
  Generating sourcemaps may expose them to the public, potentially causing your
  source code to be leaked. You can prevent this by configuring your server to
  deny access to `.js.map` files, or by deleting the sourcemaps before deploying
  your application.
</Alert>

#### Uploading Source Maps

To upload your Angular project's source maps to Sentry, we recommend one of these options:

- [Angular CLI and Sentry webpack plugin](./uploading/angular-webpack/) <br/>
  Use the Angular CLI, a custom Angular builder and the Sentry webpack plugin to set releases and upload source maps automatically when running `ng build`.
- [Nx Angular CLI and Sentry webpack plugin](./uploading/angular-nx/) <br/>
  If you're using Nx, use `@nx/angular` CLI and the Sentry webpack plugin to set releases and upload source maps automatically when running `nx build`.
- [Sentry CLI](./uploading/cli/)<br/>
  Upload source maps manually using the Sentry CLI.

Take a look at this [guide for further options to upload source maps](./uploading/).
