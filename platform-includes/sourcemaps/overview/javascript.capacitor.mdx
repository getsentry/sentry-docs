## Uploading Source Maps

The easiest way to configure uploading source maps is by using the Sentry Wizard:

<Include name="sourcemaps-wizard-instructions.mdx" />

After choosing your Sentry project, the setup process will prompt you to select a framework. This step is crucial for configuring Sentry correctly. Make sure to choose the appropriate framework based on your project’s requirements.

```example
◆  Which framework, bundler or build tool are you using?
│  ● Angular
│  ○ Create React App
│  ○ Next.js
│  ○ Remix
│  ● Webpack
│  ● Vite (Select this if you are using Vite and you have access to your Vite config.)
│  ● esbuild
│  ○ Rollup
│  ● tsc
│  ○ I use another tool
│  ○ I don't minify, transpile or bundle my code
└
```
<Note>
  If your project uses `Ionic build` for building your project, select the `tsc` option.
