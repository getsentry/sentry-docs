## Configure Source Maps Upload

Source maps upload should work if you followed the [Astro CLI installation guide](/platforms/javascript/guides/astro/#add-readable-stack-traces-to-errors). However, there are some options to configure source maps upload for your production builds for other configurations.

### Enable Source Maps Upload

To automatically upload source maps during production builds, add the `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable to your environment, for example in a `.env.sentry-build-plugin` file or in your CI setup.

<OrgAuthTokenNote />

```bash {filename:.env.sentry-build-plugin}
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=___ORG_AUTH_TOKEN___
```

Next, add your project slug to the `sourceMapsUploadOptions` in your Astro config:

```javascript {filename:astro.config.mjs}
export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    sentry({
      // Other Sentry options
      sourceMapsUploadOptions: {
        project: "___PROJECT_SLUG___",
        authToken: process.env.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN,
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Disable Source Maps Upload

You can disable automatic source maps upload in your Astro configuration with `enabled: false` under `sourceMapsUploadOptions`

### Setting the Source Maps Assets Directory

By default, the Sentry Astro integration will look for source maps in sensible default directories, depending on your `outDir`, `rootDir` and `adapter` configuration.
If these defaults don't work for you (for example, due to an advanced customized build setup or an unsupported adapter), you can specify the `assets` option to point to the folder(s) where your source maps are located:

```javascript {filename:astro.config.mjs}
export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    sentry({
      sourceMapsUploadOptions: {
        assets: [".clientOut/**/*", ".serverOut/**/*"],
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

The specified patterns must follow the [glob syntax](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob#glob-primer).

### Working With Old Authentication Tokens

Source maps work best with [organization-scoped auth tokens](/account/auth-tokens/#organization-auth-tokens). If you are using an old self-hosted Sentry version that doesn't yet support org-based tokens or you're using a different type of Sentry auth token, refer to our [legacy upload methods](/platforms/javascript/guides/astro/sourcemaps/troubleshooting_js/#working-with-old-authentication-tokens) for more information.


### Disabeling Telemetry Data Collection

The Astro SDK uses the Sentry Vite plugin to upload source maps.
This plugin collects telemetry data to help us improve the source map uploading experience.
Read more about this in our [Vite plugin documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/vite-plugin#telemetry).
You can disable telemetry collection by setting `telemetry:false` under `sourceMapsUploadOptions`.
