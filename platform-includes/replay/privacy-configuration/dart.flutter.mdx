Masking in the Sentry Flutter SDK is based on Widget _types_, e.g. `Image`, not the string representation of the type (i.e. we check whether
a `widgetInstance` should be masked by checking `if (widgetInstance is Image)` instead of `if (widgetInstance.runtimeType == 'Image')`).
This means we can ensure masking works regardless of obfuscation in release builds and also works for subclasses.
However, it also means we can only automatically mask widgets that are part of the Flutter SDK itself.

<Alert level="warning">
We cannot mask widgets defined in various 3rd-party packages (because the type is not known in the Sentry Flutter SDK),
even though many should be masked.

Therefore, you need to consider the widgets your application uses and ensure they're masked correctly with custom masking rules.
Examples of widgets that usually should be masked include (but are not limited to): VideoPlayer, WebView, Chart, etc.

</Alert>

You can tune this and add custom masking rules to fit your needs by adjusting the configuration in `options.experimental.privacy`.
For example, you can explicitly mask or unmask widgets by type,
or you can even have a callback to decide whether a specific widget instance should be masked:

```dart
  options.privacy.mask<IconButton>();
  options.privacy.unmask<Image>();
  options.privacy.maskCallback<Text>(
      (Element element, Text widget) =>
          (widget.data?.contains('secret') ?? false)
              ? SentryMaskingDecision.mask
              : SentryMaskingDecision.continueProcessing);
```

### `maskAllText`

Mask all text content. Draws a rectangle of text bounds with text color on top. Currently, only `Text` and `EditableText` Widgets are masked.

### `maskAllImages`

Mask content of all images. Draws a rectangle of image bounds with image's dominant color on top. Currently, only `Image` widgets are masked.

### `maskAssetImages`

Mask asset images coming from the root asset bundle.

### `mask<T extends Widget>()`

Mask given widget type `T` (or subclasses of `T`) in the screenshot. Note: masking rules are called in the order they're added so if a previous rule already makes a decision, this rule won't be called.

You can find more details in the documentation for each method.

<Alert>

If you find that data isn't being masked with the default settings, please let us know by creating a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dart/issues/new?template=BUG_REPORT.yml).

</Alert>

To disable masking for <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/screenshots/">`Screenshots`</PlatformLink> and <PlatformLink to="/session-replay/">`Session Replay`</PlatformLink> (not to be used on applications with sensitive data):

```dart
  options.experimental.privacy.maskAllText = false;
  options.experimental.privacy.maskAllImages = false;
```
