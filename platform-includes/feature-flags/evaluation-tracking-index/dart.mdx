If you use a third-party SDK to evaluate feature flags, you can enable Sentry to track those evaluations. Integrations are provider specific, and documentation for supported SDKs is listed below:

- [Firebase Remote Config](/platforms/dart/configuration/integrations/firebase-remote-config/)

### Manual Usage

Call `Sentry.addFeatureFlag` to track feature flag evaluations:

```dart
Sentry.addFeatureFlag("feature_flag_a", true);
```

Calling this function multiple times with the same flag name will override the previous value.
