If you use a third-party SDK to evaluate feature flags, you can enable a Sentry SDK integration to track those evaluations. Integrations are provider specific. Documentation for supported SDKs is listed below.

- <PlatformLink to="/integrations/openfeature">OpenFeature</PlatformLink>
- <PlatformLink to="/integrations/launchdarkly">LaunchDarkly</PlatformLink>

### Generic API
If you use an unsupported solution, you can use the generic API to manually track feature flag evaluations. These evaluations are held in memory and are sent to Sentry on error and transaction events. **At the moment, we only support boolean flag evaluations.**

```java {3}
import io.sentry.Sentry;

Sentry.addFeatureFlag("feature_flag.test-flag", false);
Sentry.captureException(new Exception("Something went wrong!"));
```

```kotlin {3}
import io.sentry.Sentry

Sentry.addFeatureFlag("feature_flag.test-flag", false)
Sentry.captureException(Exception("Something went wrong!"))
```

Go to your Sentry project and confirm that your error event has recorded the feature flag "test-flag" and its value "false".
