If you use a third-party SDK to evaluate feature flags, you can enable a Sentry SDK integration to track those evaluations. Integrations are provider specific. Documentation for supported SDKs is listed below.

- [LaunchDarkly](/platforms/javascript/configuration/integrations/launchdarkly/)
- [OpenFeature](/platforms/javascript/configuration/integrations/openfeature/) (multiple providers supported)
- [Statsig](/platforms/javascript/configuration/integrations/statsig/)
- [Unleash](/platforms/javascript/configuration/integrations/unleash/)

### Generic Integration

The generic `featureFlagsIntegration` allows you to manually track feature flag evaluations. Read the [documentation](/platforms/javascript/configuration/integrations/featureflags/) to learn more.
