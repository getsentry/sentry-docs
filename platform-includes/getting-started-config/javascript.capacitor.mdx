You can also use the features available with the Sentry SDK for the framework you use, such as [Angular](/platforms/javascript/guides/angular/).

### Source Maps

You will need to upload source maps to make sense of the events you receive in Sentry.

For example, if you are using Capacitor with Ionic-Angular, upload your `www` folder on **every build** you release. The values for `<release_name>` and `<dist>` must match the values passed into `Sentry.init` for events to be deminified correctly.

```bash {tabTitle: Ionic}
sentry-cli sourcemaps upload --release <release_name>  --dist <dist> ./www
```

Learn more about uploading [source maps](/platforms/javascript/guides/capacitor/sourcemaps/).

### Provide Native Debug Information (iOS)

To make stack-trace information for native crashes on iOS easier to understand, you need to provide debug information to Sentry. Debug information is provided by [uploading dSYM files](/platforms/javascript/guides/capacitor/dsym).
