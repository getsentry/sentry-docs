Sentry has a range of configuration options, but most applications will have a configuration that looks like the following:


```elixir {filename:config/config.exs}
config :sentry,
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  environment_name: Mix.env(),
  enable_source_code_context: true,
  root_source_code_paths: [File.cwd!()]
```
