We recommend initializing the SDK on the main thread as soon as possible, such as in your AppDelegate `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method:

<SignInNote />

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry // Make sure you import Sentry

// ....

func application(_ application: UIApplication,
    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {

    SentrySDK.start { options in
        options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
        options.debug = true // Enabled debug when first installing is always helpful
    }

    return true
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {

    [SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
        options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";
        options.debug = YES; // Enabled debug when first installing is always helpful

        // Enable tracing to capture 100% of transactions for performance monitoring.
        // Use 'options.tracesSampleRate' to set the sampling rate.
        // We recommend setting a sample rate in production.
        options.enableTracing = YES;
    }];

    return YES;
}
```

When using SwiftUI and your app doesn't implement an app delegate, initialize the SDK within the [App conformer's initializer](<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/app/main()>):

<SignInNote />

```swift
import Sentry

@main
struct SwiftUIApp: App {
    init() {
        SentrySDK.start { options in
            options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
            options.debug = true // Enabled debug when first installing is always helpful

            // Enable tracing to capture 100% of transactions for performance monitoring.
            // Use 'options.tracesSampleRate' to set the sampling rate.
            // We recommend setting a sample rate in production.
            options.enableTracing = true
        }
    }
}
```
