```ruby
require 'sentry-ruby'

Sentry.init do |config|
  config.dsn = '___PUBLIC_DSN___'
  config.breadcrumbs_logger = [:sentry_logger, :http_logger]

  # To activate performance monitoring, set one of these options.
  # We recommend adjusting the value in production:
  config.traces_sample_rate = 1.0
  # or
  config.traces_sampler = lambda do |context|
    0.5
  end
end
```

The code above will only set up Sentry, **not** capture any exceptions automatically.
Setting up automatic exception capturing is usually done by adding the Sentry extension
corresponding to your framework. If you cannot find a Sentry extension which meets your needs,
you can add the following code:

```ruby
at_exit do
  Sentry.capture_exception($!) if $!
end
```
