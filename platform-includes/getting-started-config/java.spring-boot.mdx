Sentry's Spring Boot integration auto-configures `sentry.in-app-packages` property with the package where `@SpringBootApplication` or `@SpringBootConfiguration` annotated class is located.

Provide a `sentry.dsn` property using either `application.properties` or `application.yml`:


```properties {filename:application.properties}
sentry.dsn=___PUBLIC_DSN___

# Add data like request headers and IP for users,
# see https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/java/guides/spring-boot/data-management/data-collected/ for more info
sentry.send-default-pii=true
# ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ logs-beta

# Enable logs to be sent to Sentry
sentry.logs.enabled=true
# ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ logs-beta
# ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ performance

# Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
# of transactions for tracing.
# We recommend adjusting this value in production.
sentry.traces-sample-rate=1.0
# ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ performance
```

```yaml {filename:application.yml}
sentry:
  dsn: ___PUBLIC_DSN___

  # Add data like request headers and IP for users,
  # see https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/java/guides/spring-boot/data-management/data-collected/ for more info
  send-default-pii: true
  # ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ logs-beta

  # Enable logs to be sent to Sentry
  logs:
    enabled: true
  # ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ logs-beta
  # ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ performance

  # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  # of transactions for tracing.
  # We recommend adjusting this value in production.
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0
  # ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ performance
```

By default, only unhandled exceptions are sent to Sentry. This behavior can be tuned through configuring the `sentry.exception-resolver-order` property. For example, setting it to `-2147483647` (the value of `org.springframework.core.Ordered#HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE`) ensures exceptions that have been handled by exception resolvers with higher order are sent to Sentry - including ones handled by `@ExceptionHandler` annotated methods.

```properties {filename:application.properties}
sentry.exception-resolver-order=-2147483647
```

```yaml {filename:application.yml}
sentry:
  exception-resolver-order: -2147483647
```

We recommend using Sentry's Spring Boot integration with one of the [logging framework integrations](logging-frameworks/) as they work together seamlessly. To use Sentry **without** Spring Boot, we recommend using the [Sentry Spring integration](/platforms/java/guides/spring/).

Once this integration is configured you can _also_ use Sentry's static API, [as shown on the usage page](usage/), to record breadcrumbs, set the current user, or manually send events, for example.
