Sentry should be initialized as early as possible in your application. We recommend putting the Sentry initialization code into its own file and including that file as the first import in your application entry point as shown in the example below:


```javascript {filename:instrument.js} {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "3-8, 13-21, 24-30", "session-replay": "22, 31-35"}}
import { useEffect } from "react";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";
import {
  createRoutesFromChildren,
  matchRoutes,
  useLocation,
  useNavigationType,
} from "react-router-dom";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    // See docs for support of different versions of variation of react router
    // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/react/configuration/integrations/react-router/
    Sentry.reactRouterV6BrowserTracingIntegration({
      useEffect,
      useLocation,
      useNavigationType,
      createRoutesFromChildren,
      matchRoutes,
    }),
    Sentry.replayIntegration(),
  ],

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for tracing.
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,

  // Set `tracePropagationTargets` to control for which URLs trace propagation should be enabled
  tracePropagationTargets: [/^\//, /^https:\/\/yourserver\.io\/api/],

  // Capture Replay for 10% of all sessions,
  // plus for 100% of sessions with an error
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

Include the Sentry initialization file as the first import statement:

```javascript
// Sentry initialization should be imported first!
import "./instrument";
import App from "./App";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

const container = document.getElementById(“app”);
const root = createRoot(container);
root.render(<App />);
```

Once this is done, all unhandled exceptions will be automatically captured by Sentry.

### React 19 Error Reporting

Starting with React 19, the `createRoot` and `hydrateRoot` methods from `react-dom` will expose error hooks that are used to capture errors automatically. To customize how errors are handled in specific error hooks, use the `Sentry.reactErrorHandler` function.

```javascript
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

const container = document.getElementById(“app”);
const root = createRoot(container, {
  // Callback called when an error is thrown and not caught by an ErrorBoundary.
  onUncaughtError: Sentry.reactErrorHandler((error, errorInfo) => {
    console.warn('Uncaught error', error, errorInfo.componentStack);
  }),
  // Callback called when React catches an error in an ErrorBoundary.
  onCaughtError: Sentry.reactErrorHandler(),
  // Callback called when React automatically recovers from errors.
  onRecoverableError: Sentry.reactErrorHandler(),
});
root.render();
```

These hooks apply to all React components that are mounted to the container which is passed onto `createRoot`/`hydrateRoot`. For more precise control over error handling, we recommend adding an `ErrorBoundary` component to your application.

### Add Error Boundary

If you're using React 16 or above, you can use the [Error Boundary](features/error-boundary/) component to automatically send Javascript errors from inside a component tree to Sentry, and set a fallback UI.

### Set Up React Router

The React Router integration is designed to work with our tracing package. Learn more about set up for our [React Router Integration](configuration/integrations/react-router/).

### Apply Redux

To apply Sentry to Redux, learn more about the [Redux Integration](configuration/integrations/redux/) and its options.
