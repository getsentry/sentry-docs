To capture all errors, even the one during the startup of your application, you should initialize the Sentry PHP SDK as soon as possible.


```php
\Sentry\init([
    'dsn' => '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
    // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ logs

    // Enable logs to be sent to Sentry
    'enable_logs' => true,
    // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ logs
]);
```
