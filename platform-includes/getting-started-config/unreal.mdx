The minimum configuration required is the [DSN](/product/sentry-basics/dsn-explainer/) of your project:


```json {tabTitle: Public DSN}
{
  "public-dsn": "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
}
```

<Alert>

If you are logged in, you can also go to your project settings and copy its DSN directly from there.

Sentry can be configured using the Sentry configuration window.
The window can be accessed by going to editor's menu: **Project Settings > Plugins > Sentry**.

By default, the SDK is automatically initialized on application startup. Alternatively, the `Initialize SDK automatically` option can be disabled and in this case, explicit SDK initialization is required.

To override SDK settings at runtime, use the `InitializeWithSettings` method of the `SentrySubsystem` class.
