In addition to capturing errors, you can monitor interactions between multiple services or applications by [enabling tracing](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/).

Select which Sentry features you'd like to install in addition to Error Monitoring to get the corresponding installation and configuration instructions below.

<OnboardingOptionButtons options={["error-monitoring", "performance"]} />

```javascript {tabTitle: Deno}  {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "5-9" }}
import * as Sentry from "npm:@sentry/deno";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for performance monitoring.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  // Learn more at
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/options/#traces-sample-rate
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

```javascript {tabTitle:npm} {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "5-9" }}
import * as Sentry from "npm:@sentry/deno";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for performance monitoring.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  // Learn more at
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/options/#traces-sample-rate
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

To ensure the SDK can send events, you should enable network access for your
ingestion domain:

```bash
deno run --allow-net=___ORG_INGEST_DOMAIN___ index.ts
```
