You should `init` the SDK in the `main` process and every `renderer` process you spawn.

<SignInNote />

In the Electron `main` process:
```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/electron/main";

Sentry.init({ dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___" });
```

In the Electron `renderer` process:
```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/electron/renderer";

Sentry.init();
```
