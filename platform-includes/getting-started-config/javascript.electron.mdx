You should `init` the SDK in the `main` process and every `renderer` process you spawn.

<SignInNote />

In the Electron `main` process:

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/electron/main";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
});
```

In the Electron `renderer` process:

```javascript {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "5, 8-12", "session-replay": "6, 13-17"}}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/electron/renderer";

Sentry.init({
  integrations: [
    Sentry.browserTracingIntegration(),
    Sentry.replayIntegration(),
  ],

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for performance monitoring.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,

  // Capture Replay for 10% of all sessions,
  // plus for 100% of sessions with an error
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```
