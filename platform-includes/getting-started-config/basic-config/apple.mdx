## Experimental features

Want to play with some new features? Try out our experimental features for [View Hierarchy](/platforms/apple/guides/ios/enriching-events/viewhierarchy/), [Time to Full Display (TTFD)](/platforms/apple/guides/ios/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#time-to-full-display), [MetricKit](/platforms/apple/guides/watchos/configuration/metric-kit/), [Prewarmed App Start Tracing](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/apple/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#prewarmed-app-start-tracing), [Swift Async Stack Traces](/platforms/apple/guides/ios/#stitch-together-swift-concurrency-stack-traces) and [App Launch Profiling](/platforms/apple/profiling/#enable-launch-profiling). Experimental features are still a work-in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.

Let us know if you have feedback through [GitHub issues](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/issues).

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    // ...

    // Enable all experimental features
    options.attachViewHierarchy = true
    options.enableMetricKit = true
    options.enableTimeToFullDisplayTracing = true
    options.swiftAsyncStacktraces = true
    options.enableAppLaunchProfiling = true
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    // ...

    // Enable all experimental features
    options.attachViewHierarchy = YES;
    options.enableMetricKit = YES;
    options.enableTimeToFullDisplayTracing = YES;
    options.swiftAsyncStacktraces = YES;
    options.enableAppLaunchProfiling = YES;
}];
```

## Stitch Together Swift Concurrency Stack Traces

<Note>This feature is experimental and may have bugs.</Note>

If you use Swift concurrency, this feature will stitch your stack traces together. That means you will be able to see the full stack trace of your async code.
For this to happen you need to enable the `swiftAsyncStacktraces` option.
You can also enable this in your Objective-C project, however, only async code written in Swift will be stitched together.

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    // ...
    options.swiftAsyncStacktraces = true
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    // ...
    options.swiftAsyncStacktraces = YES;
}];
```

## Use Sentry with SwiftUI

If you want to find out the performance of your Views in a SwiftUI project, [try the SentrySwiftUI library](/platforms/apple/performance/instrumentation/swiftui-instrumentation).

## Provide Debug Information

To capture crashes, you need to provide debug information to Sentry. You can also use our source context feature to display code snippets next to the event stack traces by enabling the `include-sources` option when uploading your debug information files. Debug information is provided by <PlatformLink to="/dsym">uploading dSYM files</PlatformLink>.
