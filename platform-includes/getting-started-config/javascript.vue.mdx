To initialize Sentry in your Vue application, add the following code snippet to your `main.js`:

### Vue 3


```javascript {filename:main.js} {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "16, 19-26", "session-replay": "17, 27-31"}}
import { createApp } from "vue";
import { createRouter } from "vue-router";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/vue";

const app = createApp({
  // ...
});
const router = createRouter({
  // ...
});

Sentry.init({
  app,
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    Sentry.browserTracingIntegration({ router }),
    Sentry.replayIntegration(),
  ],

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for tracing.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,

  // Set `tracePropagationTargets` to control for which URLs trace propagation should be enabled
  tracePropagationTargets: ["localhost", /^https:\/\/yourserver\.io\/api/],

  // Capture Replay for 10% of all sessions,
  // plus for 100% of sessions with an error
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,
});

app.use(router);
app.mount("#app");
```

### Vue 2


```javascript {filename:main.js} {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "15, 18-25", "session-replay": "16, 26-30"}}
import Vue from "vue";
import Router from "vue-router";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/vue";

Vue.use(Router);

const router = new Router({
  // ...
});

Sentry.init({
  Vue,
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    Sentry.browserTracingIntegration({ router }),
    Sentry.replayIntegration(),
  ],

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for tracing.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,

  // Set `tracePropagationTargets` to control for which URLs trace propagation should be enabled
  tracePropagationTargets: ["localhost", /^https:\/\/yourserver\.io\/api/],

  // Capture Replay for 10% of all sessions,
  // plus for 100% of sessions with an error
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,
});

// ...

new Vue({
  router,
  render: (h) => h(App),
}).$mount("#app");
```

If you're creating more than one Vue 3 app within your application, check out how to initialize the SDK for [multiple apps](./features/multiple-apps).

### Vue-Specific configuration

The SDK accepts a few Vue-specific `Sentry.init` configuration options:

- `attachProps` (defaults to `true`) - Includes all Vue components' props with the events.
- `logErrors` (defaults to `true`) - Decides whether SDK should call Vue's original `logError` function as well.
- `trackComponents` (defaults to `false`) - Track your app's components. Learn more about [component tracking](./features/component-tracking) and all its options.


### Late-Defined Vue Apps

If the Vue application is not defined from the start, you can add error monitoring for Vue-specific errors later on.
To manually add the integration for late-defined Vue applications check out the docs for the <PlatformLink to="/configuration/integrations/vue/">Vue Integration</PlatformLink>.

### Pinia Plugin

Sentry Vue SDK provides a Pinia plugin to capture Pinia action and state data. Learn more about the [Pinia Plugin](./features/pinia) and its options.
