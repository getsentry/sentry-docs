Once this is done, Sentry's PowerShell SDK can be used to capture errors.


```powershell
# You may need to import the module if you've just installed it.
Import-Module Sentry

Start-Sentry {
    # You can set it in the SENTRY_DSN environment variable, or you can set it in code here.
    $_.Dsn = '___PUBLIC_DSN___'

    # If you'd like to include data that potentially includes PII, such as Machine Name
    $_.SendDefaultPii = true
}
```
