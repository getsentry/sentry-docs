To use the SDK, you'll need to set either the `nodejs_compat` or `nodejs_als` compatibility flags in your `wrangler.toml`. This is because the SDK
needs access to the `AsyncLocalStorage` API to work correctly.

```toml {filename:wrangler.toml}
compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]
# compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_als"]
```

Then you can install the SDK and add it to your project:

You can either setup up the SDK for [Cloudflare Pages](#setup-cloudflare-pages) or
[Cloudflare Workers](#setup-cloudflare-workers).

### Setup (Cloudflare Pages)

To use this SDK, add the `sentryPagesPlugin` as
[middleware to your Cloudflare Pages application](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/middleware/).

We recommend adding a `functions/_middleware.js` for the middleware setup so that Sentry is initialized for your entire
app.

```javascript {filename:functions/_middleware.js}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/cloudflare";

export const onRequest = [
  // Make sure Sentry is the first middleware
  Sentry.sentryPagesPlugin((context) => ({
    dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100% of spans for tracing.
    tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  })),
  // Add more middlewares here
];
```

### Setup (Cloudflare Workers)

To use this SDK, wrap your handler with the `withSentry` function. This will initialize the SDK and hook into the
environment. Note that you can turn off almost all side effects using the respective options.

```javascript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/cloudflare';

export default withSentry(
  env => ({
    dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100% of spans for tracing.
    tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  }),
  {
    async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
      return new Response('Hello World!');
    },
  } satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>,
);
```
