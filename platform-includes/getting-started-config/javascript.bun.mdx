Sentry should be initialized as early in your app as possible. It is essential that you call `Sentry.init` before you require any other modules in your application—otherwise, auto-instrumentation of these modules will _not_ work.

Once this is done, Sentry's Bun SDK captures unhandled exceptions as well as tracing data for your application.

You need to create a file named `instrument.js` that imports and initializes Sentry:

```javascript {filename: instrument.js} {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "7-11"}}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/bun";

// Ensure to call this before importing any other modules!
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // Add Performance Monitoring by setting tracesSampleRate
  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100% of transactions
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  // Learn more at
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/options/#traces-sample-rate
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

Once you set a `tracesSampleRate`, performance instrumentation is automatically enabled for you. See <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation">Automatic Instrumentation</PlatformLink> to learn about all the things that the SDK automatically instruments for you.

You can also manually capture performance data - see <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation">Custom Instrumentation</PlatformLink> for details.
