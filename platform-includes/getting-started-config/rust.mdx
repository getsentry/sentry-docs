`sentry.init()` will return you a guard that when freed, will prevent process exit until all events have been sent (within a timeout):


```rust
let _guard = sentry::init(("___PUBLIC_DSN___", sentry::ClientOptions {
    release: sentry::release_name!(),
    // Capture user IPs and potentially sensitive headers when using HTTP server integrations
    // see https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/rust/data-management/data-collected for more info
    send_default_pii: true,
    ..Default::default()
}));
```
