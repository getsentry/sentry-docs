To use the SDK, initialize it in your Solid entry point before bootstrapping your app. In a typical Solid project, that is your `index.jsx` file.

<Note>
  We currently support Solid 1.8.4 and up.

```javascript {filename: index.jsx} {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "2, 12, 15-22", "session-replay": "13, 23-27"}}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/solid";
import { solidRouterBrowserTracingIntegration } from "@sentry/solid/solidrouter";
import { render } from "solid-js/web";
import { DEV } from "solid-js";
import App from "./app";

// this will only initialize your Sentry client in production builds.
if (!DEV) {
  Sentry.init({
    dsn: "__PUBLIC_DSN__",
    integrations: [
      solidRouterBrowserTracingIntegration(),
      Sentry.replayIntegration(),
    ],

    // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    // of transactions for tracing.
    // We recommend adjusting this value in production
    tracesSampleRate: 1.0,

    // Set `tracePropagationTargets` to control for which URLs trace propagation should be enabled
    tracePropagationTargets: ["localhost", /^https:\/\/yourserver\.io\/api/],

    // Capture Replay for 10% of all sessions,
    // plus 100% of sessions with an error
    replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
    replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,
  });
}

const app = document.getElementById("app");

if (!app) throw new Error("No #app element found in the DOM.");

render(() => <App />, app);
```

Once you've done this, the SDK will automatically capture unhandled errors and promise rejections, and monitor performance in the client. You can also [manually capture errors](/platforms/javascript/guides/solid/usage).
