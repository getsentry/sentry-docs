To use the SDK, initialize it in your Solid entry point before bootstrapping your app. (In a typical Solid project that's the render-client.js, or render-client.tsx.)

<SignInNote />

```javascript {filename: render-client.jsx} {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "11, 14-21", "session-replay": "12, 22-26"}}
import { render } from "solid-js/web";
import App from "./app";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";
import { DEV } from "solid-js";

// this will only initialize your Sentry client in production builds.
if (!DEV) {
  Sentry.init({
    dsn: "<Sentry DSN>",
    integrations: [
      Sentry.browserTracingIntegration(),
      Sentry.replayIntegration(),
    ],

    // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    // of transactions for performance monitoring.
    // We recommend adjusting this value in production
    tracesSampleRate: 1.0,

    // Set `tracePropagationTargets` to control for which URLs distributed tracing should be enabled
    tracePropagationTargets: ["localhost", /^https:\/\/yourserver\.io\/api/],

    // Capture Replay for 10% of all sessions,
    // plus 100% of sessions with an error
    replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
    replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,
  });
}

const app = document.getElementById("app");

if (!app) throw new Error("No #app element found in the DOM.");

render(() => <App />, app);
```

Once you've done this, the SDK will automatically capture unhandled errors and promise rejections, and monitor performance in the client.

It's also possible to add Client-Side routing to your app with [Solid-Router](https://docs.solidjs.com/guides/how-to-guides/routing-in-solid/solid-router) without changing any additional settings. As long as you use the default HTML History API to handle routing.

Once you've done this, the SDK will automatically capture unhandled errors and promise rejections, and monitor performance in the client. You can also [manually capture errors](/platforms/javascript/guides/solid/usage).
