In PHP, a closure can be used to modify the event or return a completely new one. If you return `null`, the event will be discarded.


```php
\Sentry\init([
    'dsn' => '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
    'before_send_transaction' => function (\Sentry\Event $transaction): ?\Sentry\Event {
        return $transaction;
    },
]);
```
