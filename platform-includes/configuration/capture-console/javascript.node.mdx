This integration requires you to install `@sentry/integrations` next to your main SDK package.

<SignInNote />

```javascript {tabTitle: JavaScript}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/node";
import { captureConsoleIntegration } from "@sentry/integrations";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [captureConsoleIntegration()],
});
```
