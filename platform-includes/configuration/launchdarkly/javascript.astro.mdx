Before using this integration, you need to install and instrument the [LaunchDarkly SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/launchdarkly-js-client-sdk) in your app. Learn more by reading [LaunchDarkly's docs](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk/client-side/javascript).

```javascript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/astro';
import * as LaunchDarkly from 'launchdarkly-js-client-sdk';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
  integrations: [Sentry.launchDarklyIntegration()]
});

const ldClient = LaunchDarkly.initialize(
    'my-client-ID',
    {kind: 'user', key: 'my-user-context-key'},
    {inspectors: [Sentry.buildLaunchDarklyFlagUsedHandler()]}
);

// Evaluate a flag with a default value. You may have to wait for your client to initialize first.
ldClient?.variation('test-flag', false);

Sentry.captureException(new Error('Something went wrong!'))
```
