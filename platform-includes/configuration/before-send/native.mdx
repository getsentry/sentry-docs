```c
#include <sentry.h>

sentry_value_t strip_sensitive_data(sentry_value_t event, void *hint) {
  /* modify event here or return NULL to discard the event */
  return event;
}

int main(void) {
  sentry_options_t *options = sentry_options_new();
  sentry_options_set_before_send(options, strip_sensitive_data, NULL);
  sentry_init(options);

  /* ... */
}
```

The callback is executed in the same thread as the call to `sentry_capture_event`. Work performed by the function may thus block the executing thread. For this reason, consider avoiding heavy work in `before_send`.

#### Using `on_crash`

The `before_send` callback implementation in `sentry-native` makes it hard to distinguish between normal events and crashes. For this reason, we introduced another callback, `on_crash`, which - at this point - only exists in `sentry_native`:

```c
#include <sentry.h>

static sentry_value_t
crash_cleanup(
    const sentry_ucontext_t *uctx, // provides the user-space context of the crash
    sentry_value_t event,          // used the same way as in `before_send`
    void *closure                  // user-data that you can provide at configuration time
)
{
    // Do contextual clean-up before the crash is sent to sentry's backend infrastructure

    /* ... */

    // tell the backend to retain the event (+ dump)
    // or to discard it, you could free the event and return a `null`:
    //       sentry_value_decref(event);
    //       return sentry_value_new_null();
    return event;
}

int main(void) {
  sentry_options_t *options = sentry_options_new();
  sentry_options_set_on_crash(options, crash_cleanup, NULL);
  sentry_init(options);

  /* ... */
}
```

The `on_crash` callback replaces `before_send` as a callback for crash events only. They can be defined simultaneously, where the SDK prevents `before_send` from being invoked for crash events. This allows for better differentiation between crashes and other events and gradual migration from existing `before_send` implementations:

- If you have a `before_send` implementation and do not define an `on_crash`
  callback `before_send` will receive both normal and crash events as before
- If you only want to pre-process normal events with `before_send`, then
  you can define an "empty" `on_crash` callback that returns the
  passed-in event and does nothing else.
- If you are not interested in pre-processing normal events but only want
  to act on crashes, then only define an `on_crash` callback with the option
  to filter (available for all backends) or enrich (only for `inproc`) the
  crash event.

<Alert level="warning" title="Not Supported in Crashpad on macOS">

The Crashpad backend on macOS doesn't currently support notifying the crashing process and thus can't correctly terminate sessions or call the registered `before_send` or `on_crash` hooks. It will also lose any events queued for sending at the time of the crash.

</Alert>

<Alert level="warning" title="Limitations in Crashpad on Windows for Fast-fail Crashes">

The Crashpad backend on Windows supports fast-fail crashes, which bypass SEH (Structured Exception Handling) primarily for security reasons. `sentry-native` registers a WER (Windows Error Reporting) module, which signals the `crashpad_handler` to send a minidump when a fast-fail crash occurs. However, since this process bypasses SEH, the application local exception handler is no longer invoked, which also means that for these kinds of crashes, `before_send` and `on_crash` will not be invoked before sending the minidump and thus have no effect.
