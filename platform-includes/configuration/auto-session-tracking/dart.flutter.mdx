#### Mobile

By default, the session is terminated once the application is in the background for more than `30 seconds`. You can change this default by setting the `autoSessionTrackingInterval` option to a `Duration` of your choosing.

```dart {2}
await SentryFlutter.init((options) {
  options.autoSessionTrackingInterval = const Duration(seconds: 60)
});
```

#### Web

<Alert>

Requires SDK version `9.0.0` or higher.

</Alert>

On web it's required to use the `SentryNavigatorObserver` since sessions are tied to navigation events, and for your navigation routes to have names, for example using `RouteSettings`.
Read more [here](/platforms/dart/guides/flutter/integrations/routing-instrumentation/#1-add-sentrynavigationobserver) on how to add the `SentryNavigatorObserver` to your app.

<Alert>

If you don't use the `SentryNavigatorObserver` then sessions will not be tracked in your application.
Once you have set up the `SentryNavigatorObserver` make sure every route has a unique name otherwise the release health could be inconsistent and inaccurate.

</Alert>

#### Disable Auto Session Tracking

If you'd like to opt out of capturing sessions, set the `enableAutoSessionTracking` option to `false`. If you disable this feature, release health will not be available.

```dart {2}
await SentryFlutter.init((options) {
  options.enableAutoSessionTracking = false;
});
```
