#### Mobile

By default, the session is terminated once the application is in the background for more than `30 seconds`. You can change this default by setting the `autoSessionTrackingInterval` option to a `Duration` of your choosing.

```dart {2}
SentryFlutter.init((options) {
  options.autoSessionTrackingInterval = const Duration(seconds: 60)
});
```

#### Web

<Alert>

Requires SDK version `9.0.0` or higher.

</Alert>

On web you're required to use the `SentryNavigatorObserver` since sessions are tied to navigation events.
Read more [here](/platforms/dart/guides/flutter/integrations/routing-instrumentation/#1-add-sentrynavigationobserver) on how to add the `SentryNavigatorObserver` to your app.
If the `SentryNavigatorObserver` is not used in your app, sessions will not be tracked for web.

#### Disable Auto Session Tracking

If you'd like to opt out of capturing sessions, set the `enableAutoSessionTracking` option to `false`. If you disable this feature, release health will not be available.

```dart {2}
SentryFlutter.init((options) {
  options.enableAutoSessionTracking = false;
});
```
