{/* TODO(v9): Update this for the new behaviour (sessions are persisted in sessionStorage or memory) */}

We create a session for every page load. For single-page applications, we will create a new session for every navigation change (History API).

We mark the session as:

- crashed if an _unhandled error_ or _unhandled promise rejection_ bubbled up to the global handler.
- errored if the SDK captures an event that contains an exception (this includes manually captured errors).

To receive data on user adoption, such as users crash free rate percentage, and the number of users that have adopted a specific release, set the user on the [`initialScope`](/platforms/javascript/configuration/options/#initial-scope) when initializing the SDK.

By default, the JavaScript SDKs are sending sessions. To disable sending sessions, set the `autoSessionTracking` flag to `false`:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  autoSessionTracking: false, // default: true
});
```

<Alert title="Deprecation Notice">

{/* We don't use platform links here because we always have to link to node and browser here and doing a conditional just for that feels overkill. */}

Starting with SDK version 8.43.0 and up, the `autoSessionTracking` option has been deprecated. You can use the [BrowserSession integration](/platforms/javascript/configuration/integrations/browsersession/) in browser environments and the [Http integration](/platforms/javascript/guides/node/configuration/integrations/http/) (via the `trackIncomingRequestsAsSessions` option) in Node.js runtime.
