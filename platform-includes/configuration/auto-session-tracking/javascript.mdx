<PlatformCategorySection supported={['browser']}>

By default, the JavaScript Browser SDKs are sending sessions.
We create a session for every page load. For single-page applications, we will create a new session for every navigation change (History API).

To disable sending sessions, disable the `BrowserSession` integration:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  defaultIntegrations: (integrations) => {
    return integrations.filter(
      (integration) => integration.name !== "BrowserSession"
    );
  },
});
```

</PlatformCategorySection>

<PlatformCategorySection supported={['server']}>
<PlatformSection notSupported={['javascript.cloudflare', 'javascript.bun', 'javascript.deno']}>

By default, the Node.js-based SDKs are sending sessions.
Sessions are created for every incoming request.
To disable sending sessions, set `trackIncomingRequestsAsSessions: false` in the `httpIntegration`:

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/node";

Sentry.init({
  integrations: [httpIntegration({ trackIncomingRequestsAsSessions: false })],
});
```

</PlatformSection >
</PlatformCategorySection>

Sesisons are marked as:

- crashed if an _unhandled error_ or _unhandled promise rejection_ bubbled up to the global handler.
- errored if the SDK captures an event that contains an exception (this includes manually captured errors).

To receive data on user adoption, such as users crash free rate percentage, and the number of users that have adopted a specific release, set the user on the [`initialScope`](/platforms/javascript/configuration/options/#initial-scope) when initializing the SDK.
