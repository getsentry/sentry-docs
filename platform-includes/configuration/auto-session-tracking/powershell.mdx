We mark the session as:

- Healthy
- Abnormal
- Errored: if the SDK captures an event that contains an exception (this includes manually captured errors).
- Crashed

To enable sending sessions, set the `AutoSessionTracking` flag to `$true`. When enabled, the SDK is creating a session on application startup and ending it on shut down.

```powershell
Start-Sentry {
    $_.AutoSessionTracking = $true
}
```
