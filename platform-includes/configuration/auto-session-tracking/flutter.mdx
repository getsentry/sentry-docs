To benefit from the health data, you must use at least version 4.0.0 of the Flutter SDK.

#### Session Timeout

By default, the session is terminated once the application is in the background for more than `30 seconds`. You can change this default by setting the `autoSessionTrackingInterval` option to a `Duration` of your choosing.

```dart {2}
SentryFlutter.init((options) {
  options.autoSessionTrackingInterval = const Duration(seconds: 60)
});
```

#### Disable Auto Session Tracking

If you'd like to opt out of capturing sessions, set the `enableAutoSessionTracking` option to `false`. If you disable this feature, release health will not be available.

```dart {2}
SentryFlutter.init((options) {
  options.enableAutoSessionTracking = false;
});
```
