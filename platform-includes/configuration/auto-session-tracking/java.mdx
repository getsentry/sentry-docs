To benefit from the health data, you must manually instrument your application by calling the public APIs `Sentry.startSession()` and `Sentry.endSession()` at the appropriate times. For example, in a desktop application, you can start the session when the application launches and end it when the application terminates (or when it is sent to the background for longer than a certain period of time).

Additionally, to display the Crash Free Users percentage, you must also specify a `distinctId`. We recommend setting this to a user id (or an equivalent identifier) for your application:

```java
import io.sentry.Sentry;

Sentry.init(options -> {
  options.setDistinctId(userId);
});
```

```kotlin
import io.sentry.Sentry

Sentry.init { options ->
  options.distinctId = userId
}
```
