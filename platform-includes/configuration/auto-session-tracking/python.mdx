We create a session for every request and response cycle, and mark the session as:

- `crashed` if an _unhandled error_ is raised.
- `an error` if the SDK captures an event that contains an exception (this includes manually captured errors).

Currently, web socket connections don't create sessions.

By default, the Python SDK sends sessions. To disable sending sessions, set the `auto_session_tracking` flag to `False`:

```python
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    # ...

    auto_session_tracking=False,
)
```
