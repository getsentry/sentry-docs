```c
#include <sentry.h>

sentry_close();
```

Calling `sentry_close()` (formerly `sentry_shutdown()`) before exiting the application is critical to avoid
data loss.

After closing, the client cannot be used anymore. It's important to only call
`sentry_close()` immediately before shutting down the application.
