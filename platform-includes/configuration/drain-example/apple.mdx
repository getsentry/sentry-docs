The Apple SDK automatically stores the Sentry events on the device's disk before shutdown.

There are times where you may need to manually call `close()` to ensure that events are sent before the app terminates. For example, if an app user revokes some privacy consent and the app can't use Sentry anymore, calling `close()` will still send the events to Sentry.

```swift
SentrySDK.close()
```
