For example, initialize with `Start-Sentry` in your PowerShell script:


```powershell
Start-Sentry {
    # A Sentry Data Source Name (DSN) is required.
    # See https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-basics/dsn-explainer/
    # You can set it in the SENTRY_DSN environment variable, or you can set it in code here.
    $_.Dsn = '___PUBLIC_DSN___'

    # When debug is enabled, the Sentry client will emit detailed debugging information to the console.
    # This might be helpful, or might interfere with the normal operation of your application.
    # We enable it here for demonstration purposes when first trying Sentry.
    # You shouldn't do this in your applications unless you're troubleshooting issues with Sentry.
    # Alternatively, you can pass `-Debug` to the `Start-Sentry` command.
    $_.Debug = $true

    # This option is recommended. It enables Sentry's "Release Health" feature.
    $_.AutoSessionTracking = $true

    # This option will enable Sentry's tracing features. You still need to start transactions and spans.
    # Example sample rate for your transactions: captures 10% of transactions
    $_.TracesSampleRate = 0.1
}
```
