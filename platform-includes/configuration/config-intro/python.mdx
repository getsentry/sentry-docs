Options are passed to the `init()` function as optional keyword arguments:


```python
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    max_breadcrumbs=50,
    debug=True,
    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for tracing.
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
    # Add request headers and IP for users,
    # see https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/data-management/data-collected/ for more info
    send_default_pii=True,

    # By default the SDK will try to use the SENTRY_RELEASE
    # environment variable, or infer a git commit
    # SHA as release, however you may want to set
    # something more human-readable.
    # release="myapp@1.0.0",
)
```
