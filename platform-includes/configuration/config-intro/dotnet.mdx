For example, initialize with `SentrySdk.Init` in your `Program.cs` file:


```csharp
SentrySdk.Init(options =>
{
    // A Sentry Data Source Name (DSN) is required.
    // See https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-basics/dsn-explainer/
    // You can set it in the SENTRY_DSN environment variable, or you can set it in code here.
    options.Dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___";

    // When debug is enabled, the Sentry client will emit detailed debugging information to the console.
    // This might be helpful, or might interfere with the normal operation of your application.
    // We enable it here for demonstration purposes when first trying Sentry.
    // You shouldn't do this in your applications unless you're troubleshooting issues with Sentry.
    options.Debug = true;

    // This option is recommended. It enables Sentry's "Release Health" feature.
    options.AutoSessionTracking = true;

    // Enabling this option is recommended for client applications only. It ensures all threads use the same global scope.
    options.IsGlobalModeEnabled = false;

    // Example sample rate for your transactions: captures 10% of transactions
    options.TracesSampleRate = 0.1;
});
```

<Note>

After you have configured Sentry in your code, you can also configure the
[MSBuild setup](/platforms/dotnet/configuration/msbuild/) for your project. While this step is optional,
it can greatly improve your Sentry experience.
