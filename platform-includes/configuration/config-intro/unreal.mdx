In order to provide native crash support, the Sentry SDK for Unreal Engine includes platform-specific SDKs, such as [Android](/platforms/android/), [Apple](/platforms/apple/), and [Native](/platforms/native/). Those SDKs share the options with which they get initialized.

The UE layer self-initializes through the use of the custom [UEngineSubsystem](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.3/en-US/API/Runtime/Engine/Subsystems/UEngineSubsystem/).

<Note>

Different options won't always be compatible with all platforms. Be sure to read the UE editor notices specifying which platforms the specific option works with.
