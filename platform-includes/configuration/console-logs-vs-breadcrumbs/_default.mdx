<Alert level="warning" title="Did you mean logs instead?">

This integration captures console logs as breadcrumbs (great for error context!). But if you need to search and query your logs across your entire application, use <PlatformLink to="/logs/">Sentry Logs</PlatformLink> instead. Set `enableLogs: true`, and add the <PlatformLink to="/logs/#integrations">Sentry console logging integration</PlatformLink> in your SDK config.
