import * as Sentry from '@sentry/browser';
import { OpenFeature } from '@openfeature/web-sdk';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
  integrations: [Sentry.openFeatureIntegration()]
});

OpenFeature.setProvider(new MyProviderOfChoice());
OpenFeature.addHooks(new Sentry.OpenFeatureIntegrationHook());

const client = OpenFeature.getClient();
const result = client.getBooleanValue('test-flag', false); // evaluate with a default value
Sentry.captureException(new Error('Something went wrong!'));
