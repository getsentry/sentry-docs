```javascript {filename: main.ts} {3, 7-8}
Sentry.init({
  // Note, replayIntegration is NOT instantiated below:
  integrations: [],

  // Replay sample rates still have to be set in `Sentry.init`:
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,
});

// Sometime later
Sentry.lazyLoadIntegration("replayIntegration").then((replayIntegration) => {
  Sentry.addIntegration(replayIntegration());
});
```
