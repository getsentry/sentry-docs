The default scrubber implementation will run automatically and filter anything in the [`denylist`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/blob/4b361c5c008aec1a33cf521014edc0297fbf89c1/sentry_sdk/scrubber.py#L15-L56) from [potentially sensitive interfaces](/platforms/python/data-collected/) in the event payload. These are typically security values such as passwords, authentication, sessions, cookies, and CSRF tokens.

Additionally, if <PlatformIdentifier name="send-default-pii" /> is set to `False`, the scrubber will also filter from a separate `pii_denylist` that typically has PII values such as IP addresses.

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.scrubber import EventScrubber

sentry_sdk.init(
    # ...
    send_default_pii=False,
    event_scrubber=EventScrubber(),  # this is set by default
)
```

You can also pass in a custom `denylist` or `pii_denylist` to the `EventScrubber` class and filter additional fields that you want. Make sure you extend the current lists if you want to use the default lists as well.

```python
from sentry_sdk.scrubber import EventScrubber, DEFAULT_DENYLIST, DEFAULT_PII_DENYLIST

# custom denylist
denylist = DEFAULT_DENYLIST + ["my_sensitive_var"]
pii_denylist = DEFAULT_PII_DENYLIST + ["my_private_var"]

sentry_sdk.init(
    # ...
    send_default_pii=False,
    event_scrubber=EventScrubber(denylist=denylist, pii_denylist=pii_denylist),
)
```

The scrubber will check parts of the event that are most likely to contain data from the denylist, like user and request data. However, by default, it will not search these recursively for performance reasons. If you want the scrubber to be recursive, initialize it with `recursive=True`.

```python
from sentry_sdk.scrubber import EventScrubber

sentry_sdk.init(
    # ...
    send_default_pii=False,
    event_scrubber=EventScrubber(recursive=True),
)
```
