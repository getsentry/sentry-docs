<Include name="migration/javascript-v8/v7-deprecation/browser-tracing" />

Browser tracing is automatically set up for you in these packages so you do not need to change you code unless you were using the `BrowserTracing` class directly.

```JavaScript {sentry.client.config.js} diff
 import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

 Sentry.init({
   dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
-  integrations: [new Sentry.BrowserTracing()],
+  integrations: [Sentry.browserTracingIntegration()],
 });
```
