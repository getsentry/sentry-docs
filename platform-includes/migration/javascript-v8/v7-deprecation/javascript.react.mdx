For react, we provide multiple integrations to cover different router integrations:

### React Router v6

```JavaScript diff
 import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react';

 Sentry.init({
   integrations: [
-    new Sentry.BrowserTracing({
-      routingInstrumentation: Sentry.reactRouterV6Instrumentation({
-        useEffect,
-        useLocation,
-        useNavigationType,
-        createRoutesFromChildren,
-        matchRoutes,
-        stripBasename,
-      }),
-    }),
+    Sentry.reactRouterV6BrowserTracingIntegration({
+      useEffect,
+      useLocation,
+      useNavigationType,
+      createRoutesFromChildren,
+      matchRoutes,
+      stripBasename,
+    }),
   ],
 });
```

### React Router v4/v5

```JavaScript diff
 import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react';

 Sentry.init({
   integrations: [
-    new Sentry.BrowserTracing({
-      routingInstrumentation: Sentry.reactRouterV5Instrumentation({
-        history,
-      }),
-    }),
+    Sentry.reactRouterV5BrowserTracingIntegration({
+      history,
+    }),
   ],
 });
```

### React Router v3

```JavaScript diff
 import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react';

 Sentry.init({
   integrations: [
-    new Sentry.BrowserTracing({
-      routingInstrumentation: Sentry.reactRouterV3Instrumentation({
-        history,
-        routes,
-        match,
-      }),
-    }),
+    Sentry.reactRouterV3BrowserTracingIntegration({
+      history,
+      routes,
+      match,
+    }),
   ],
 });
```

### No React Router

```JavaScript diff
 import * as Sentry from "@sentry/svelte";

 Sentry.init({
   dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
-  integrations: [new Sentry.BrowserTracing()],
+  integrations: [Sentry.browserTracingIntegration()],
 });
```
