## Summary of Changes

If you only use basic features of Sentry, or you simply copy & pasted the setup examples from our docs, here's what changed for you:

- If you installed additional Sentry packages, such as`@sentry/profiling-node` alongside your Sentry SDK (e.g. `@sentry/react` or `@sentry/node`), make sure to upgrade all of them to version 8. In addition, the `@sentry/hub`, `@sentry/tracing`, `@sentry/integrations`, `@sentry/serverless`, and `@sentry/replay` package have all been removed.

- Our SDKs now generate ES2018+ compatible code. This means we now only support Node 14.18 or higher and ES2018 compatible browsers. New minimum supported browsers:

  - Chrome 63
  - Edge 79
  - Safari/iOS Safari 12
  - Firefox 58
  - Opera 50
  - Samsung Internet 8.2

For IE11 support please transpile your code to ES5 using babel or similar and add required polyfills.

- Integrations are now functional instead of class based. For example, the import for session replay uses `Sentry.replayIntegration` instead of `new Sentry.Replay`.

- The SDK's Performance API has been revamped. More details can be found in documentation about the [new Performance Monitoring APIs](./v8-new-performance-api/)

- Initializing the Node SDK has been vastly simplified. You no longer need to use `autoDiscoverNodePerformanceMonitoringIntegrations` or use `Sentry.Handlers`, as these are now automatically included by the SDK without configuration. To make this work, you now have to ensure `Sentry.init` is initialized **before any other code is imported and used**.

```JavaScript
// In v7, this was fine:
const Sentry = require("@sentry/node");
const express = require("express");

Sentry.init({
  // ...
});

const app = express();

// ...

// In v8, in order to ensure express is instrumented,
// you have to initialize before you import:
const Sentry = require("@sentry/node");
Sentry.init({
  // ...
});

const express = require("express");
const app = express();

Sentry.setupExpressErrorHandler(app);
```
