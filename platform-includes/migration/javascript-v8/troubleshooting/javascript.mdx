### Conflicting Dependency Versions with Bundler Plugins

If you are getting errors from within the Sentry SDK that it is trying to access certain functions that are not available, for example "... is not a function", it is possible that there are misaligned versions installed.

The Sentry JavaScript Bundler Plugins (`@sentry/webpack-plugin`, `@sentry/vite-plugin`, `@sentry/esbuild-plugin`, `@sentry/rollup-plugin`) used to depend on certain Sentry SDK packages on version 7 wich may clash with version 8 of the SDK.

The recommendation is to upgrade the JavaScript Bundler Plugin packages to at least version `2.14.2` which will no longer include dependencies on v7 of the Sentry JavaScript SDK.
