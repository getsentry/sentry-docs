### Removal of `@sentry/integrations` package

`@sentry/integrations` has been removed and will no longer be published. We moved pluggable integrations from their own package (`@sentry/integrations`) to `@sentry/browser`. In addition they are now functions instead of classes.

<Note>

Integrations will still be available via the CDN, but they will exposed as functions not classes as is shown below.

</Note>

Integrations that are now exported from `@sentry/browser` for client-side init:

- `httpClientIntegration` (`HTTPClient`)
- `contextLinesIntegration` (`ContextLines`)
- `reportingObserverIntegration` (`ReportingObserver`)
- `captureConsoleIntegration` (`CaptureConsole`)
- `debugIntegration` (`Debug`)
- `extraErrorDataIntegration` (`ExtraErrorData`)
- `rewriteFramesIntegration` (`RewriteFrames`)
- `sessionTimingIntegration` (`SessionTiming`)
- `dedupeIntegration` (`Dedupe`) - Note: enabled by default, not pluggable

The `Transaction` integration has been removed from `@sentry/integrations`. There is no replacement API.
