### Removal of `@sentry/integrations` package

`@sentry/integrations` has been removed and will no longer be published. We moved pluggable integrations from their own package (`@sentry/integrations`) to `@sentry/remix`. In addition they are now functions instead of classes.

Integrations that are now exported from `@sentry/remix` for client-side init:

- `httpClientIntegration` (`HTTPClient`)
- `contextLinesIntegration` (`ContextLines`)
- `reportingObserverIntegration` (`ReportingObserver`)

Integrations that are now exported from `@sentry/remix` for client-side and server-side init:

- `captureConsoleIntegration` (`CaptureConsole`)
- `debugIntegration` (`Debug`)
- `extraErrorDataIntegration` (`ExtraErrorData`)
- `rewriteFramesIntegration` (`RewriteFrames`)
- `sessionTimingIntegration` (`SessionTiming`)
- `dedupeIntegration` (`Dedupe`) - Note: enabled by default, not pluggable

The `Transaction` integration has been removed from `@sentry/integrations`. There is no replacement API.
