### Supported versions

Sentry Remix SDK `8.x` supports Node `14.18.0` or higher

If you need to support older versions of Node.js, please use Sentry Remix SDK `7.x`.

<Include name="migration/javascript-v8/compatible-browsers" />

### Updated SDK initialization

To migrate your Remix app to Sentry Node SDK `8.x`, you need to make the following changes:

1. Move your server-side `Sentry.init` call so that it is called before any other `require`/`import` statements in `entry.server.tsx`.

Due to the way that auto instrumentation works in `8.x` of the Sentry Remix SDK, it is required that you initialize Sentry before you require or import any other package. Any package that is required/imported before Sentry is initialized may not be correctly auto-instrumented.

```JavaScript {filename:entry.server.tsx}
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/remix';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

export const handleError = Sentry.wrapRemixHandleError;

// rest of your code and imports
```

<Note>
  Since
  [8.10.0](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/releases/tag/8.10.0),
  you can also setup `@sentry/remix` with a new `autoInstrumentRemix: true`
  option. See <PlatformLink to="/manual-setup">Manual Setup</PlatformLink> for
  details on how to use this option.
</Note>

2. Remove any performance related integrations from your server-side init in `entry.server.tsx`.

All performance auto-instrumentation will be automatically enabled if the package is found. You do not need to add any integration yourself, and `autoDiscoverNodePerformanceMonitoringIntegrations()` has also been removed.

```JavaScript {filename:entry.server.tsx}
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/remix';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

With 8.x, `@sentry/remix` on the server has been completely overhauled. It is now powered by [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) under the hood. You do not need to know or understand what OpenTelemetry is in order to use Sentry. We set up OpenTelemetry under the hood. If you use OpenTelemetry-native APIs to start spans, Sentry will pick up everything automatically.

We now support the following integrations out of the box with 0 configuration:

- `httpIntegration`: Automatically instruments Node http and https standard libraries
- `nativeNodeFetchIntegration`: Automatically instruments top level fetch and undici
- `graphqlIntegration`: Automatically instruments GraphQL
- `mongoIntegration`: Automatically instruments MongoDB
- `mongooseIntegration`: Automatically instruments Mongoose
- `mysqlIntegration`: Automatically instruments MySQL
- `mysql2Integration`: Automatically instruments MySQL2
- `postgresIntegration`: Automatically instruments PostgreSQL

3. Move your client-side `Sentry.init` call so that it is called before any other `require`/`import` statements in `entry.client.tsx`.

```JavaScript diff
 import { useLocation, useMatches } from "@remix-run/react";
 import * as Sentry from "@sentry/remix";
 import { useEffect } from "react";

 Sentry.init({
   dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
   integrations: [
-    new Sentry.BrowserTracing({
-      routingInstrumentation: Sentry.remixRouterInstrumentation(
-        useEffect,
-        useLocation,
-        useMatches
-      ),
-    }),
+     Sentry.browserTracingIntegration({
+      useEffect,
+      useLocation,
+      useMatches,
+    }),
   ],
 });
```

### Ensure Request Isolation

For any non-HTTP scenarios (e.g. websockets or a scheduled job), you'll have to manually ensure request isolation by wrapping the function with `Sentry.withIsolationScope()`. Previously we recommended you use `Sentry.runWithAsyncContext` for this but that has been removed in `8.x`.

```JavaScript
const Sentry = require('@sentry/node');

function myScheduledJob() {
  return Sentry.withIsolationScope(async () => {
    await doSomething();
    await doSomethingElse();
    return { status: 'DONE' };
  });
}
```

This way, anything happening inside of this function will be isolated, even if they run concurrently.
