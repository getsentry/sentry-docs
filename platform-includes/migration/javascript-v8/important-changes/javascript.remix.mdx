### Supported versions

Sentry Remix SDK `8.x` supports Node `14.18.0` or higher

If you need to support older versions of Node.js, please use Sentry Remix SDK `7.x`.

<Include name="migration/javascript-v8/compatible-browsers" />

### Updated SDK initialization

To migrate your Remix app to Sentry Node SDK `8.x`, you need to make the following changes:

1. Move your server-side `Sentry.init` call so that it is called before any other `require`/`import` statements in `entry.server.tsx`.

Due to the way that auto instrumentation works in `8.x` of the Sentry Remix SDK, it is required that you initialize Sentry before you require or import any other package. Any package that is required/imported before Sentry is initialized may not be correctly auto-instrumented.

```JavaScript {filename:entry.server.tsx}
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/remix';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

export const handleError = Sentry.wrapRemixHandleError;

// rest of your code and imports
```

2. Remove any performance related integrations from your server-side init in `entry.server.tsx`.

All performance auto-instrumentation will be automatically enabled if the package is found. You do not need to add any integration yourself, and `autoDiscoverNodePerformanceMonitoringIntegrations()` has also been removed.

```JavaScript {filename:entry.server.tsx}
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/remix';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

With 8.x, `@sentry/remix` on the server has been completely overhauled. It is now powered by [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) under the hood. You do not need to know or understand what OpenTelemetry is in order to use Sentry. We set up OpenTelemetry under the hood, though if you use OpenTelemetry-native APIs to start spans, Sentry will pick up everything automatically.

We now support the following integrations out of the box with 0 configuration:

- `httpIntegration`: Automatically instruments Node http and https standard libraries
- `nativeNodeFetchIntegration`: Automatically instruments top level fetch and undici
- `graphqlIntegration`: Automatically instruments GraphQL
- `mongoIntegration`: Automatically instruments MongoDB
- `mongooseIntegration`: Automatically instruments Mongoose
- `mysqlIntegration`: Automatically instruments MySQL
- `mysql2Integration`: Automatically instruments MySQL2
- `postgresIntegration`: Automatically instruments PostgreSQL
- `prismaIntegration`: Automatically instruments Prisma

3. Move your client-side `Sentry.init` call so that it is called before any other `require`/`import` statements in `entry.client.tsx`.

```JavaScript diff
 import * as Sentry from "@sentry/angular";

 Sentry.init({
   dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
-  integrations: [
-    new Sentry.BrowserTracing({
-      routingInstrumentation: Sentry.routingInstrumentation(router),
-    })
-  ],
+  integrations: [Sentry.browserTracingIntegration({ router })],
 });
```

### Ensure Request Isolation

For any non-HTTP scenarios (e.g. websockets or a scheduled job), you'll have to manually ensure request isolation by wrapping the function with `Sentry.withIsolationScope()`. Previously we recommended you use `Sentry.runWithAsyncContext` for this but that has been removed in `8.x`.

```JavaScript
const Sentry = require('@sentry/node');

function myScheduledJob() {
  return Sentry.withIsolationScope(async () => {
    await doSomething();
    await doSomethingElse();
    return { status: 'DONE' };
  });
}
```

This way, anything happening inside of this function will be isolated, even if they run concurrently.
