### Supported versions

Sentry Serverless SDK for AWS Lambda `8.x` supports Node `14.18.0` or higher. In addition the SDK now supports AWS SDK v3.

If you need to support older versions of Node.js, please use Sentry Serverless SDK for AWS Lambda `7.x`.

### Updated SDK initialization

With 8.x, the Sentry Serverless SDK for AWS Lambda has been completely overhauled. It is now powered by [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) under the hood. You do not need to know or understand what OpenTelemetry is in order to use Sentry. We set up OpenTelemetry under the hood. If you use OpenTelemetry-native APIs to start spans, Sentry will pick up everything automatically.

With this change, `@sentry/serverless` has been removed and will no longer be published. The AWS related code now lives in `@sentry/aws-serverless`.

Here's an example of instrumentating your AWS Lambda with Sentry Serverless SDK `8.x`:

```JavaScript
const Sentry = require('@sentry/aws-serverless');

Sentry.init({
  dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
  tracesSampleRate: 1,
});

// async (recommended)
exports.handler = Sentry.wrapHandler(async (event, context) => {
  throw new Error('oh, hello there!');
});

// sync also works
// exports.handler = Sentry.wrapHandler((event, context, callback) => {
//   throw new Error('oh, hello there!');
// });
```

To migrate your AWS Lambda handlers to Sentry Serverless SDK for AWS Lambda `8.x`, you need to make the following changes:

1. Move your `Sentry.init` call so that it is called before any other `require`/`import` statements.

Due to the way that auto instrumentation works in `8.x` of the Sentry Serverless SDK for AWS Lambda, it is required that you initialize Sentry before you require or import any other package. Any package that is required/imported before Sentry is initialized may not be correctly auto-instrumented.

In addition, instead of using a a namespace import, `Sentry.AWSLambda`, directly import the methods from the SDK.

```JavaScript diff
const Sentry = require('@sentry/aws-serverless');

- Sentry.AWSLambda.init({ dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___' });
+ Sentry.init({ dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___' });
```

2. Remove any performance related integrations

All performance auto-instrumentation will be automatically enabled if the package is found. You do not need to add any integration yourself, and `autoDiscoverNodePerformanceMonitoringIntegrations()` has also been removed.

We now support the following integrations out of the box with 0 configuration:

- `httpIntegration`: Automatically instruments Node http and https standard libraries
- `nativeNodeFetchIntegration`: Automatically instruments top level fetch and undici
- `expressIntegration`: Automatically instruments Express.js
- `graphqlIntegration`: Automatically instruments GraphQL
- `mongoIntegration`: Automatically instruments MongoDB
- `mongooseIntegration`: Automatically instruments Mongoose
- `mysqlIntegration`: Automatically instruments MySQL
- `mysql2Integration`: Automatically instruments MySQL2
- `postgresIntegration`: Automatically instruments PostgreSQL
- `prismaIntegration`: Automatically instruments Prisma

We also automatically instrument AWS SDK v2 and AWS SDK v3.
