### Supported versions

Sentry Gatsby SDK `8.x` supports React version `16.0.0` or higher.

If you need to support older versions of React, please use Sentry Gatsby SDK `7.x`.

<Include name="migration/javascript-v8/compatible-browsers" />

### Updated error types to be `unknown` instead of `Error`

In v8, we are changing the `ErrorBoundary` error types returned from `onError`, `onReset`, `onUnmount`, and
`beforeCapture` to be `unknown` instead of `Error`. This more accurately matches the behavior of `componentDidCatch`, which is the
lifecycle method Sentry's `ErrorBoundary` component uses.

As per the [React docs on error boundaries](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#componentdidcatch):

> error: The `error` that was thrown. In practice, it will usually be an instance of `Error` but this is not guaranteed
> because JavaScript allows to throw any value, including strings or even `null`.

This means you will have to use `instanceof Error` or similar to explicitly make sure that the error thrown was an
instance of `Error`.

The Sentry SDK maintainers also went ahead and made a PR to update the
[TypeScript definitions of `componentDidCatch`](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/69434) for the
React package. This will be released with React 20.

### Removal of Gatsby Initialization via plugin options

In `8.x`, we are removing the ability to initialize the Gatsby SDK via plugin options.

Previously you could use the `gatsby-config.js` file to initialize the SDK like this:

```JavaScript {filename:gatsby-config.js}
module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: '@sentry/gatsby',
      options: {
        dsn: process.env.SENTRY_DSN,
      },
    },
    // ...
  ],
};
```

Now you still use the `gatsby-config.js`:

```JavaScript {filename:gatsby-config.js}
module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: '@sentry/gatsby',
    },
    // ...
  ],
};
```

But you should also create a `sentry.config.js` file in the root of your project and initialize the SDK there:

```JavaScript {filename:sentry.config.js}
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/gatsby';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
});
```
