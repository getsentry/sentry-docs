### Supported versions

Sentry SvelteKit SDK `8.x` supports Node `14.18.0` or higher

If you need to support older versions of Node.js, please use Sentry SvelteKit SDK `7.x`.

<Include name="migration/javascript-v8/compatible-browsers" />

### Updated SDK initialization

With `8.x` the Server-side Setup of the SvelteKit SDK now needs to be initialized before anything else runs in `hooks.server.js|ts`. Make sure to move `Sentry.init` to the top of the file.

```JavaScript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/sveltekit";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

// rest of your code and imports
```

With 8.x, `@sentry/sveltekit` on the server has been completely overhauled. It is now powered by [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) under the hood. You do not need to know or understand what OpenTelemetry is in order to use Sentry. We set up OpenTelemetry under the hood, no knowledge of it is required in order to get started, though if you use OpenTelemetry-native APIs to start spans, and Sentry will pick up everything automatically.

We now support the following integrations out of the box with 0 configuration:

- `httpIntegration`: Automatically instruments Node http and https standard libraries
- `nativeNodeFetchIntegration`: Automatically instruments top level fetch and undici
- `graphqlIntegration`: Automatically instruments GraphQL
- `mongoIntegration`: Automatically instruments MongoDB
- `mongooseIntegration`: Automatically instruments Mongoose
- `mysqlIntegration`: Automatically instruments MySQL
- `mysql2Integration`: Automatically instruments MySQL2
- `postgresIntegration`: Automatically instruments PostgreSQL
- `prismaIntegration`: Automatically instruments Prisma

### Breaking `sentrySvelteKit()` changes

Under the hood, the SvelteKit SDK uses [Sentry Vite Plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/vite-plugin) to upload sourcemaps and automatically associate add releases to your events. In `8.x`, the SDK now uses `2.x` of the Sentry Vite Plugin which brings many improvements and bug fixes. Sourcemaps uploading with the SvelteKit SDK now uses <Link to="/platforms/javascript/sourcemaps/troubleshooting_js/artifact-bundles/">Debug IDs</Link>.

To allow future upgrades of the Vite plugin without breaking stable and public APIs in `sentrySvelteKit`, we modified the `sourceMapsUploadOptions` to remove the hard dependency on the API of the plugin. While you previously could specify all [version 0.x Vite plugin options](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/vite-plugin/v/0.6.1), we now reduced them to a subset of [2.x options](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/vite-plugin/v/2.14.2#options).

Previously configuring your options looked like this:

```JavaScript {filename:vite.config.js}
// SvelteKit SDK 7.x
sentrySvelteKit({
  sourceMapsUploadOptions: {
    org: process.env.SENTRY_ORG,
    project: process.env.SENTRY_PROJECT,
    authToken: process.env.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN,
    release: '1.0.1',
    injectRelease: true,
    include: ['./build/*/**/*'],
    ignore: ['**/build/client/**/*']
  },
}),
```

Now they look like this:

```JavaScript {filename:vite.config.js}
// SvelteKit SDK 8.x
sentrySvelteKit({
  sourceMapsUploadOptions: {
    org: process.env.SENTRY_ORG,
    project: process.env.SENTRY_PROJECT,
    authToken: process.env.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN,
    release: {
	    name: '1.0.1',
	    inject: true
    },
    sourcemaps: {
	    assets: ['./build/*/**/*'],
	    ignore: ['**/build/client/**/*'],
	    filesToDeleteAfterUpload: ['./build/**/*.map']
    },
  },
}),
```

In the future, we might add additional [options](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/vite-plugin/v/2.14.2#options)
from the Vite plugin but if you would like to specify some of them directly, you can do this by passing in an
`unstable_sentryVitePluginOptions` object:

```JavaScript {filename:vite.config.js}
sentrySvelteKit({
  sourceMapsUploadOptions: {
    // ...
    release: {
	    name: '1.0.1',
    },
    unstable_sentryVitePluginOptions: {
      release: {
        setCommits: {
          auto: true
        }
      }
    }
  },
}),
```

Important: we DO NOT guarantee stability of `unstable_sentryVitePluginOptions`. They can be removed or updated at any
time, including breaking changes within the same major version of the SDK.
