### Supported versions

Sentry SvelteKit SDK `8.x` supports Node `14.18.0` or higher

If you need to support older versions of Node.js, please use Sentry SvelteKit SDK `7.x`.

<Include name="migration/javascript-v8/compatible-browsers" />

### Updated SDK initialization

With `8.x` the Server-side Setup of the SvelteKit SDK now needs to be initialized before anything else runs in `hooks.server.js|ts`. Make sure to move `Sentry.init` to the top of the file.

```JavaScript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/sveltekit";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

// rest of your code and imports
```

### Breaking `sentrySvelteKit()` changes

Under the hood, the SvelteKit SDK uses [Sentry Vite Plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/vite-plugin) to upload sourcemaps and automatically associate add releases to your events. In `8.x`, the SDK now uses `2.x` of the Sentry Vite Plugin which brings many improvements and bug fixes. Sourcemaps uploading with the SvelteKit SDK now uses <Link to="/platforms/javascript/sourcemaps/troubleshooting_js/artifact-bundles/">Debug IDs</Link>.

To allow future upgrades of the Vite plugin without breaking stable and public APIs in `sentrySvelteKit`, we modified the `sourceMapsUploadOptions` to remove the hard dependency on the API of the plugin. While you previously could specify all [version 0.x Vite plugin options](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/vite-plugin/v/0.6.1), we now reduced them to a subset of [2.x options](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/vite-plugin/v/2.14.2#options).

Previously configuring your options looked like this:

```JavaScript {filename:vite.config.js}
// SvelteKit SDK 7.x
sentrySvelteKit({
  sourceMapsUploadOptions: {
    org: process.env.SENTRY_ORG,
    project: process.env.SENTRY_PROJECT,
    authToken: process.env.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN,
    release: '1.0.1',
    injectRelease: true,
    include: ['./build/*/**/*'],
    ignore: ['**/build/client/**/*']
  },
}),
```

Now they look like this:

```JavaScript {filename:vite.config.js}
// SvelteKit SDK 8.x
sentrySvelteKit({
  sourceMapsUploadOptions: {
    org: process.env.SENTRY_ORG,
    project: process.env.SENTRY_PROJECT,
    authToken: process.env.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN,
    release: {
	    name: '1.0.1',
	    inject: true
    },
    sourcemaps: {
	    assets: ['./build/*/**/*'],
	    ignore: ['**/build/client/**/*'],
	    filesToDeleteAfterUpload: ['./build/**/*.map']
    },
  },
}),
```

In the future, we might add additional [options](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/vite-plugin/v/2.14.2#options)
from the Vite plugin but if you would like to specify some of them directly, you can do this by passing in an
`unstable_sentryVitePluginOptions` object:

```JavaScript {filename:vite.config.js}
sentrySvelteKit({
  sourceMapsUploadOptions: {
    // ...
    release: {
	    name: '1.0.1',
    },
    unstable_sentryVitePluginOptions: {
      release: {
        setCommits: {
          auto: true
        }
      }
    }
  },
}),
```

Important: we DO NOT guarantee stability of `unstable_sentryVitePluginOptions`. They can be removed or updated at any
time, including breaking changes within the same major version of the SDK.
