### Supported versions

Sentry React SDK `8.x` supports React version `16.14.0` or higher.

If you need to support older versions of React, please use Sentry Next.js SDK `7.x`.

<Include name="migration/javascript-v8/compatible-browsers" />

### Updated error types to be `unknown` instead of `Error`

In v8, we are changing the `ErrorBoundary` error types returned from `onError`, `onReset`, `onUnmount`, and
`beforeCapture` to be `unknown` instead of `Error`. This more accurately matches the behavior of `componentDidCatch`, which is the
lifecycle method Sentry's `ErrorBoundary` component uses.

As per the [React docs on error boundaries](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#componentdidcatch):

> error: The `error` that was thrown. In practice, it will usually be an instance of `Error` but this is not guaranteed
> because JavaScript allows to throw any value, including strings or even `null`.

This means you will have to use `instanceof Error` or similar to explicitly make sure that the error thrown was an
instance of `Error`.

The Sentry SDK maintainers also went ahead and made a PR to update the
[TypeScript definitions of `componentDidCatch`](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/pull/69434) for the
React package. This will be released with React 20.
