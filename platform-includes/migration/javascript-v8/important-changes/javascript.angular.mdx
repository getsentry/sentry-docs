### Supported versions

Sentry Angular SDK `8.x` supports Angular Ivy by default and supports Angular version `14.0.0` or higher.

As a result, `@sentry/angular-ivy` has been removed in favor of `@sentry/angular`. If you are using Angular 13 or lower, we suggest upgrading your Angular version before migrating to `8.x`. If you can't upgrade your Angular version to at least Angular 14, you can also continue using the `7.x` of `@sentry/angular-ivy` SDK.

In addition the SDK now only works with ES2018 compatible browsers. The minimum supported browser versions are:

- Chrome 63
- Edge 79
- Safari/iOS Safari 12
- Firefox 58
- Opera 50
- Samsung Internet 8.2

For IE11 support please transpile your code to ES5 using babel or similar and add required polyfills.
