### Supported versions

Sentry Angular SDK `8.x` supports Angular Ivy by default and supports Angular version `14.0.0` or higher.

As a result, `@sentry/angular-ivy` has been removed in favor of `@sentry/angular`. If you are using Angular 13 or lower, we suggest upgrading your Angular version before migrating to `8.x`. If you can't upgrade your Angular version to at least Angular 14, you can also continue using the `7.x` of the `@sentry/angular-ivy` SDK.
