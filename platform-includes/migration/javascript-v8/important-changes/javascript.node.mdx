### Supported versions

Sentry Node SDK `8.x` supports Node `14.18.0` or higher

If you need to support older versions of Node.js, please use Sentry Node SDK `7.x`.

### Updated SDK initialization

With 8.x, @sentry/node has been completely overhauled. It is now powered by [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) under the hood. You do not need to know or understand what OpenTelemetry is in order to use Sentry. We set up OpenTelemetry under the hood. If you use OpenTelemetry-native APIs to start spans, Sentry will pick up everything automatically.

To migrate your Node.js app to Sentry Node SDK `8.x`, you need to make the following changes:

1. Create an external file called `instrument.js` and move your `Sentry.init` call to it.

Due to the way that auto instrumentation works in `8.x` of the Sentry Node SDK, it is required that you initialize Sentry before you require or import any other package. Any package that is required/imported before Sentry is initialized may not be correctly auto-instrumented.

```javascript {tabTitle:CommonJS} {filename: instrument.js}
const Sentry = require('@sentry/node');

Sentry.init({
  // ...
});
```

```javascript {tabTitle:ESM} {filename: instrument.mjs}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/node";

Sentry.init({
  // ...
});
```


2. Remove any performance related integrations

All performance auto-instrumentation will be automatically enabled if the package is found. You do not need to add any integration yourself, and `autoDiscoverNodePerformanceMonitoringIntegrations()` has also been removed.

```javascript {tabTitle:CommonJS} {filename: instrument.js}
const Sentry = require('@sentry/node');

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

```javascript {tabTitle:ESM} {filename: instrument.mjs}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/node";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

We now support the following integrations out of the box with 0 configuration:

- `httpIntegration`: Automatically instruments Node `http` and `https` standard libraries
- `nativeNodeFetchIntegration`: Automatically instruments top level fetch and undici
- `expressIntegration`: Automatically instruments Express.js
- `fastifyIntegration`: Automatically instruments Fastify
- `hapiIntegration`: Automatically instruments Hapi
- `graphqlIntegration`: Automatically instruments GraphQL
- `mongoIntegration`: Automatically instruments MongoDB
- `mongooseIntegration`: Automatically instruments Mongoose
- `mysqlIntegration`: Automatically instruments MySQL
- `mysql2Integration`: Automatically instruments MySQL2
- `nestIntegration`: Automatically instruments Nest.js
- `postgresIntegration`: Automatically instruments PostgreSQL
- `prismaIntegration`: Automatically instruments Prisma
- `connectIntegration`: Automatically instruments Connect

3. Require `instrument.js` before any other module in your application

```javascript {tabTitle:CommonJS} {filename: app.js}
// Require this first!
require("./instrument");

// Now require other modules
const http = require("http");

// Your application code goes here
```

```javascript {tabTitle:ESM} {filename: app.mjs}
// Import this first!
import "./instrument";

// Now import other modules
import http from "http";

// Your application code goes here
```

<Alert level="warning" title="Running with ESM">

If you run your application with ESM, you need to import the Sentry Initialization file before importing any other modules. See <PlatformLink to="/install/esm">running Sentry with ESM</PlatformLink>.
If you are unsure how you are running your application, see <PlatformLink to="/install">Installation Methods</PlatformLink> for more information.

</Alert>

### Ensure Request Isolation

For any non-HTTP scenarios (e.g. websockets or a scheduled job), you'll have to manually ensure request isolation by wrapping the function with `Sentry.withIsolationScope()`. Previously we recommended you use `Sentry.runWithAsyncContext` for this but that has been removed in `8.x`.

```javascript {tabTitle:CommonJS}
const Sentry = require('@sentry/node');

function myScheduledJob() {
  return Sentry.withIsolationScope(async () => {
    await doSomething();
    await doSomethingElse();
    return { status: 'DONE' };
  });
}
```

```javascript {tabTitle:ESM}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/node";

function myScheduledJob() {
  return Sentry.withIsolationScope(async () => {
    await doSomething();
    await doSomethingElse();
    return { status: 'DONE' };
  });
}
```

This way, anything happening inside of this function will be isolated, even if they run concurrently.
