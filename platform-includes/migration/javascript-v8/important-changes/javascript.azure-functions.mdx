### Supported versions

Sentry Node SDK `8.x` supports Node `14.18.0` or higher

If you need to support older versions of Node.js, please use Sentry Node SDK `7.x`.

### Updated SDK initialization

With 8.x, @sentry/node has been completely overhauled. It is now powered by [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) under the hood. You do not need to know or understand what OpenTelemetry is in order to use Sentry. We set up OpenTelemetry under the hood, no knowledge of it is required in order to get started, though if you use OpenTelemetry-native APIs to start spans, and Sentry will pick up everything automatically.

If you want to customize the OpenTelemetry setup, see the docs about using [OpenTelemetry with `8.x`](./v8-opentelemetry)

Here's an example of instrumentating your Azure Function with Sentry Node SDK `8.x`:

```JavaScript
const Sentry = require('@sentry/node');

Sentry.init({
  dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
  tracesSampleRate: 1,
});

module.exports = async function (context, req) {
  return Sentry.withIsolationScope(async () => {
    getCurrentScope().setSDKProcessingMetadata({ request: ctx.request });
    try {
      await notExistFunction();
    } catch (e) {
      Sentry.captureException(e);
      await Sentry.flush(2000);
    }

    context.res = {
      status: 200,
      body: "Hello from Azure Cloud Function!",
    };
  });
};
```

To migrate your Google Cloud Function handlers to Sentry Serverless SDK for Azure Functions `8.x`, you need to make the following changes:

1. Move your `Sentry.init` call so that it is called before any other `require`/`import` statements.

Due to the way that auto instrumentation works in `8.x` of the Sentry Serverless SDK for Azure Functions, it is required that you initialize Sentry before you require or import any other package. Any package that is required/imported before Sentry is initialized may not be correctly auto-instrumented.

2. Remove any performance related integrations

All performance auto-instrumentation will be automatically enabled if the package is found. You do not need to add any integration yourself, and `autoDiscoverNodePerformanceMonitoringIntegrations()` has also been removed.

We now support the following integrations out of the box with 0 configuration:

- `httpIntegration`: Automatically instruments Node http and https standard libraries
- `nativeNodeFetchIntegration`: Automatically instruments top level fetch and undici
- `expressIntegration`: Automatically instruments Express.js
- `graphqlIntegration`: Automatically instruments GraphQL
- `mongoIntegration`: Automatically instruments MongoDB
- `mongooseIntegration`: Automatically instruments Mongoose
- `mysqlIntegration`: Automatically instruments MySQL
- `mysql2Integration`: Automatically instruments MySQL2
- `postgresIntegration`: Automatically instruments PostgreSQL
- `prismaIntegration`: Automatically instruments Prisma
