### Supported versions

Sentry Node SDK `8.x` supports Node `14.18.0` or higher

If you need to support older versions of Node.js, please use Sentry Node SDK `7.x`.

### Updated SDK initialization

With 8.x, @sentry/node has been completely overhauled. It is now powered by [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) under the hood. You do not need to know or understand what OpenTelemetry is in order to use Sentry. We set up OpenTelemetry under the hood, no knowledge of it is required in order to get started, though if you use OpenTelemetry-native APIs to start spans, and Sentry will pick up everything automatically.

Here's an example of instrumentating a Fastify application with Sentry Node SDK `8.x`:

```javascript {tabTitle:CommonJS}
require("./instrument");
const { fastify } = require("fastify");
const Sentry = require("@sentry/node");
const app = fastify();

Sentry.setupFastifyErrorHandler(app);

// Add your routes, etc.

app.listen({ port: 3030 });
```

```javascript {tabTitle:ESM}
import "./instrument";
import { fastify } from "fastify";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/node";
const app = fastify();

Sentry.setupFastifyErrorHandler(app);

// Add your routes, etc.

app.listen({ port: 3030 });
```

To migrate your Fastify app to Sentry Node SDK `8.x`, you need to make the following changes:

1. Create an external file called `instrument.js` and move your `Sentry.init` call to it.

Due to the way that auto instrumentation works in `8.x` of the Sentry Node SDK, it is required that you initialize Sentry before you require or import any other package. Any package that is required/imported before Sentry is initialized may not be correctly auto-instrumented.

```JavaScript {tabTitle:CommonJS} {filename: instrument.js}
const Sentry = require('@sentry/node');

Sentry.init({
  // ...
});
```

```JavaScript diff {tabTitle:ESM} {filename: instrument.mjs}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/node";

Sentry.init({
  // ...
});
```

2. Remove any performance related integrations

All performance auto-instrumentation will be automatically enabled if the package is found. You do not need to add any integration yourself, and `autoDiscoverNodePerformanceMonitoringIntegrations()` has also been removed. This means you can remove all custom `requestHandler` and `tracingMiddleware` Sentry code.

We now support the following integrations out of the box with 0 configuration:

- `httpIntegration`: Automatically instruments Node http and https standard libraries
- `nativeNodeFetchIntegration`: Automatically instruments top level fetch and undici
- `koaIntegration`: Automatically instruments Koa
- `graphqlIntegration`: Automatically instruments GraphQL
- `mongoIntegration`: Automatically instruments MongoDB
- `mongooseIntegration`: Automatically instruments Mongoose
- `mysqlIntegration`: Automatically instruments MySQL
- `mysql2Integration`: Automatically instruments MySQL2
- `postgresIntegration`: Automatically instruments PostgreSQL
- `prismaIntegration`: Automatically instruments Prisma

3. Require `instrument.js` before any other module in your application

```JavaScript diff {tabTitle:CommonJS}
+require('./instrument');
 const { fastify } = require("fastify");
 const Sentry = require("@sentry/node");
 const app = fastify();
```

```JavaScript diff {tabTitle:ESM}
+import './instrument';
 import { fastify } from "fastify";
 import * as Sentry from "@sentry/node";
 const app = fastify();
```

<Alert level="warning" title="Running with ESM">

If you run your application with ESM, you need to import the Sentry Initialization file before importing any other modules. See <PlatformLink to="/install/esm">running Sentry with ESM</PlatformLink>.
If you are unsure how you are running your application, see <PlatformLink to="/install">Installation Methods</PlatformLink> for more information.

</Alert>

### Ensure Request Isolation

For any non-HTTP scenarios (e.g. websockets or a scheduled job), you'll have to manually ensure request isolation by wrapping the function with `Sentry.withIsolationScope()`. Previously we recommended you use `Sentry.runWithAsyncContext` for this but that has been removed in `8.x`.

```javascript {tabTitle:CommonJS}
const Sentry = require("@sentry/node");

function myScheduledJob() {
  return Sentry.withIsolationScope(async () => {
    await doSomething();
    await doSomethingElse();
    return { status: "DONE" };
  });
}
```

```javascript {tabTitle:ESM}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/node";

function myScheduledJob() {
  return Sentry.withIsolationScope(async () => {
    await doSomething();
    await doSomethingElse();
    return { status: "DONE" };
  });
}
```

This way, anything happening inside of this function will be isolated, even if they run concurrently.
