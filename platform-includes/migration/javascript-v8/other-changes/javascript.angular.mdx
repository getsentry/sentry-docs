### Renaming Angular Tracing Decorator

The usage of `TraceClassDecorator` and the `TraceMethodDecorator` already implies that those are decorators. The word Decorator is now removed from the names to avoid multiple mentioning.

Additionally, the `TraceClass` and `TraceMethod` decorators accept an optional name parameter to set the transaction name. This was added because Angular minifies class and method names, and you might want to set a more descriptive name. If nothing provided, the name defaults to 'unnamed'.

```TypeScript
// Before (7.x)
@Sentry.TraceClassDecorator()
export class HeaderComponent {
  @Sentry.TraceMethodDecorator()
  ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges) {}
}

// After (8.x)
@Sentry.TraceClass({ name: 'HeaderComponent' })
export class HeaderComponent {
  @Sentry.TraceMethod({ name: 'ngOnChanges' })
  ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges) {}
}
```
