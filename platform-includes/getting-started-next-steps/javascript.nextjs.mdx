## Next Steps

At this point, you should have integrated Sentry into your Next.js application and should already be sending error and performance data to your Sentry project.

Now's a good time to customize your setup and look into more advanced topics.
Our next recommended steps for you are:

- Learn how to [manually capture errors](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/usage/)
- Continue to [customize your configuration](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/configuration/)
- Get familiar with [Sentry's product features](/product) like tracing, insights, and alerts
- Learn more about our [Vercel integration](/organization/integrations/deployment/vercel/)
