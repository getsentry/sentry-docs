## Advanced Configuration Options

### Changing Config Files Location

Sentry automatically detects configuration files named `sentry.(client|server).config.js` in the root of your project. You can rename these files or move them to a custom folder within your project.
To change their location or names, specify the paths in the Sentry Astro integration options in your `astro.config.mjs`:

```javascript {filename:astro.config.mjs}
export default defineConfig({
  // Other Astro project options
  integrations: [
    sentry({
      clientInitPath: ".config/sentryClientInit.js",
      serverInitPath: ".config/sentryServerInit.js",
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Server Instrumentation

<Alert>

Auto instrumentation only works for Astro 3.5.2 or newer. If you're using an older version, you need to [manually add the Sentry middleware](#manually-add-server-instrumentation) instead.

</Alert>

In SSR or hybrid mode configured Astro apps, the Sentry Astro integration will automatically add an [Astro middleware](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/middleware/) request handler to your server code. This middleware enhances the data collected by Sentry on the server side by:

- Collecting performance spans for incoming requests
- Enabeling distributed tracing between client and server
- Enhancing captured errors with additional information

### Manually Add Server Instrumentation

For Astro versions below 3.5.2, you need to manually add the Sentry middleware to your `src/middleware.js` file:

```javascript {filename:src/middleware.(js|ts)}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/astro";
import { sequence } from "astro:middleware";

export const onRequest = sequence(
  Sentry.handleRequest()
  // other middleware handlers
);
```

If you have multiple request handlers, make sure to add the Sentry middleware as the first handler in the sequence.

### Customize Server Instrumentation

Sentry's Astro middleware gives you control over what additional data should be added to the recorded request spans.

To customize the server instrumentation, add the Sentry middleware to your `src/middleware.js` file:

```javascript {filename:src/middleware.(js|ts)}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/astro";
import { sequence } from "astro:middleware";

export const onRequest = sequence(
  Sentry.handleRequest({
    trackClientIp: true, // defaults to false
    trackHeaders: true, // defaults to false
  })
  // other middleware handlers
);
```

If you're using Astro 3.5.2 or newer, make sure to also disable auto instrumentation as shown below.

### Disable Auto Server Instrumentation

For Astro 3.5.2 or newer, you can disable the automatic server instrumentation by turning off the `requestHandler` auto instrumentation option:

```javascript {filename:astro.config.mjs}
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
import sentry from "@sentry/astro";

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    sentry({
      autoInstrumentation: {
        requestHandler: false,
      },
    }),
  ],
  output: "server",
});
```
