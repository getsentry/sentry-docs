The Sentry middleware for this framework **automatically creates transactions** for all incoming HTTP requests when tracing is enabled. Each transaction includes:

- **Transaction name**: HTTP method and route path (e.g., `GET /users/:id`)
- **HTTP status code**: Captured when the response is sent
- **Distributed tracing**: Continues traces from upstream services via Sentry trace headers
- **Request context**: Hub attached for additional error capture and custom spans

You can add custom child spans within your handlers to track specific operations.
