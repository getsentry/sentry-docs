If you don't already have an account and a Sentry project established, sign up for [Sentry](https://sentry.io/signup/) for free, then return to this page.

## Install

In addition to capturing errors, you can monitor interactions between multiple services or applications by [enabling tracing](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/). You can also collect and analyze performance profiles from real users with [profiling](/product/explore/profiling/).

Select which Sentry features you'd like to install in addition to Error Monitoring to get the corresponding installation and configuration instructions below.

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your applicationâ€™s runtime.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-install" />

## Configure

Sentry should be initialized in your app as early as possible. It's essential that you call `Sentry.init` before you require any other modules in your application, otherwise, auto-instrumentation won't work for these modules.

Once this is done, Sentry's Node SDK will capture unhandled exceptions as well as tracing data for your application.

To import and initialize Sentry, you'll need to create a file named `instrument.js`:

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-config" />

<OnboardingOption optionId="performance">

Once you set a `tracesSampleRate`, performance instrumentation will be automatically enabled. Read about <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation">Automatic Instrumentation</PlatformLink> to learn more about what the SDK can automatically instrument for you.

You can also manually capture performance data - see <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation">Custom Instrumentation</PlatformLink> for details.

</OnboardingOption>

## Use

To ensure that Sentry can automatically instrument all modules in your application, you'll need to require or import the `instrument.js` file before requiring any other modules in your application:

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-use" />

<Alert level="warning" title="Running with ESM">

If you run your application with ESM, you'll need to import the Sentry Initialization file before importing any other modules. Read about <PlatformLink to="/install/esm">running Sentry with ESM</PlatformLink>.
If you're not sure about how you're running your application, see <PlatformLink to="/install">Installation Methods</PlatformLink> for more information.

## Verify

This snippet includes an intentional error, so you can test to make sure that everything is working as soon as you set it up.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-verify" />

<Note>

Learn more about manually capturing an error or message in our <PlatformLink to="/usage/">Usage documentation</PlatformLink>.

</Note>

To view and resolve the recorded error, log into [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and select your project. Clicking on the error's title will open a page where you can see detailed information and mark it as resolved.
