## Install

<OnboardingOptionButtons
  options={["error-monitoring", "performance", "profiling"]}
/>

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your application’s runtime. This means that you have to add `@sentry/node` as a runtime dependency to your application:

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-install" />

## Configure

Sentry should be initialized as early in your app as possible. It is essential that you call `Sentry.init` before you require any other modules in your application—otherwise, auto-instrumentation of these modules will _not_ work.

Once this is done, Sentry's Node SDK captures unhandled exceptions as well as tracing data for your application.

You need to create a file named `instrument.js` that imports and initializes Sentry:

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-config" />

<OnboardingOption optionId="performance">

Once you set a `tracesSampleRate`, performance instrumentation is automatically enabled for you. See <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation">Automatic Instrumentation</PlatformLink> to learn about all the things that the SDK automatically instruments for you.

You can also manually capture performance data - see <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation">Custom Instrumentation</PlatformLink> for details.

</OnboardingOption>

## Use

You need to require or import the `instrument.js` file before requiring any other modules in your application. This is necessary to ensure that Sentry can automatically instrument all modules in your application:

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-use" />

<Alert level="warning" title="Running with ESM">

If you run your application with ESM, you need to import the Sentry Initialization file before importing any other modules. See <PlatformLink to="/install/esm">running Sentry with ESM</PlatformLink>.
If you are unsure how you are running your application, see <PlatformLink to="/install">Installation Methods</PlatformLink> for more information.

## Verify

This snippet includes an intentional error, so you can test that everything is working as soon as you set it up.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-verify" />

<Note>

Learn more about manually capturing an error or message in our <PlatformLink to="/usage/">Usage documentation</PlatformLink>.
