## Step 1: Install

Choose the features you want to configure, and this guide will show you how:

<OnboardingOptionButtons
  options={["error-monitoring", "performance", "profiling", "logs"]}
/>

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-features-expandable" />

### Install the Sentry SDK

Run the command for your preferred package manager to add the Sentry SDK to your application:

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-install" />

## Step 2: Configure

### Initialize the Sentry SDK

To import and initialize Sentry, create a file named `instrument.(js|mjs)` in the root directory of your project and add the following code:

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-config" />

### Apply Instrumentation to Your App

Make sure to initialize Sentry before you require or import any other modules in your app. Otherwise, auto-instrumentation won't work for these modules.

<Alert level="info" title="Which module system are you using?">

The method for applying instrumentation depends on whether your application uses CommonJS (CJS) or ECMAScript Modules (ESM). If you're unsure which system you're using or if you're looking for alternative installation methods, see <PlatformLink to="/install">here</PlatformLink>.

</Alert>

#### CommonJS

Require the `instrument.js` file before any other modules:

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-use" />

#### ESM

When running your application in ESM mode, use the [--import](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--importmodule) command line option and point it to `instrument.mjs` to load the module before the application starts:

```bash
# Note: This is only available for Node v18.19.0 onwards.
node --import ./instrument.mjs app.mjs
```

## Step 3: Add Readable Stack Traces With Source Maps (Optional)

The stack traces in your Sentry errors probably won't look like your actual code. To fix this, upload your source maps to Sentry.
The easiest way to do this is by using the Sentry Wizard:

```bash
npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i sourcemaps
```

## Step 4: Verify Your Setup

Let's test your setup and confirm that Sentry is working correctly and sending data to your Sentry project.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-verify" />

### View Captured Data in Sentry

Now, head over to your project on [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io/) to view the collected data (it takes a couple of moments for the data to appear).

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-verify-locate-data" />

## Next Steps

At this point, you should have integrated Sentry into your Node.js application and should already be sending data to your Sentry project.

Now's a good time to customize your setup and look into more advanced topics.
Our next recommended steps for you are:

- Extend Sentry to your frontend using one of our [frontend SDKs](/)
- Learn how to [manually capture errors](/platforms/javascript/guides/node/usage/)
- Continue to [customize your configuration](/platforms/javascript/guides/node/configuration/)
- Get familiar with [Sentry's product features](/product) like tracing, insights, and alerts
