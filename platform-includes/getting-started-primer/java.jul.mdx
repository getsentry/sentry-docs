<Alert>

The `sentry-jul` library provides a [java.util.logging Handler](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/logging/Handler.html) that sends logged exceptions to Sentry.

<Alert level="info" title="Sentry Logs">

  Enable the Sentry Logs feature to unlock Sentry's full logging power. With Sentry Logs, you can search, filter, and analyze logs from across your entire application in one place.

</Alert>

Once this integration is configured you can _also_ use Sentry’s static API, <PlatformLink to="/usage/">as shown on the usage page</PlatformLink>, in order to do things like record breadcrumbs, set the current user, or manually send events. The source can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/tree/master/sentry-jul).
