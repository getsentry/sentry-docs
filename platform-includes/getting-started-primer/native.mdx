The Sentry Native SDK is intended for C and C++. However, since it builds as a dynamic library and exposes C-bindings, it can be used by any language that supports interoperability with C, such as the Foreign Function Interface (FFI).

<Note>

Using the `sentry-native` SDK in a standalone use case is currently an experimental feature. The SDK’s primary function is to fuel our other SDKs, like [`sentry-java`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java) or [`sentry-unreal`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-unreal). Support from our side is best effort and we do what we can to respond to issues in a timely fashion, but please understand if we won’t be able to address your issues or feature suggestions.

</Note>

Sentry also offers higher-level SDKs for platforms with built-in support for native crashes:

- [_Android_](/platforms/android/)
- [_Apple (Cocoa)_](/platforms/apple/)
- [_Electron_](/platforms/javascript/guides/electron/)
