Sentry's Nuxt SDK enables automatic reporting of errors and performance data.

## Compatibility

The Sentry Nuxt SDK supports Nuxt version `3.7.0` and above. For best results, we recommend
using Nuxt `3.14.0` or later, which includes updated dependencies critical to the SDK's functionality.

In case you are using Nuxt before version `3.14.0`, add the following overrides:

```json {tabTitle:npm} {filename:package.json}
"overrides": {
  "ofetch": "^1.4.0"
  "@vercel/nft": "^0.27.4"
}
```

```json {tabTitle:yarn} {filename:package.json}
"resolutions": {
  "ofetch": "^1.4.0"
  "@vercel/nft": "^0.27.4"
}
```

```json {tabTitle:pnpm} {filename:package.json}
"pnpm": {
  "overrides": {
    "ofetch": "^1.4.0"
    "@vercel/nft": "^0.27.4"
  }
}
```
