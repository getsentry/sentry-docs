Sentry's Nuxt SDK enables automatic reporting of errors and performance data.

## Compatibility

The minimum supported Nuxt version is `3.7.0`.

<Note>
  We are currently investigating an issue where the server-side is not correctly initialized with a recent update of Nitro (the server-side toolkit in Nuxt).

  We are working on figuring this out ([see issue here](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/14514)). For the time being, you can add the following overrides to your application:

  <br/>

  ```json {tabTitle:npm} {filename:package.json}
  "overrides": {
    "nitropack": "2.9.7"
    "@vercel/nft": "^0.27.4"
  }
  ```

  ```json {tabTitle:yarn} {filename:package.json}
  "resolutions": {
    "nitropack": "2.9.7"
    "@vercel/nft": "^0.27.4"
  }
  ```

  ```json {tabTitle:pnpm} {filename:package.json}
  "pnpm": {
    "overrides": {
      "nitropack": "2.9.7"
      "@vercel/nft": "^0.27.4"
    }
  }
  ```
