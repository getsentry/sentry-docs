Our SDK for Godot Engine builds on top of existing Sentry SDKs, extending them with Godot-specific features. It gives developers helpful hints for where and why an error or performance issue might have occurred.

**Features:**

- Native support for automatic crash and error reporting for:
  - Windows and Linux using the [Native SDK](/platforms/native/) to support C and C++ with minidumps
  - macOS using the [macOS SDK](/platforms/apple/guides/macos/) to support Objective-C, Swift, C and C++
  - iOS using the [iOS SDK](/platforms/apple/guides/ios/) to support Objective-C, Swift, C and C++
  - Android using the [Android SDK](/platforms/android/) to support Java, Kotlin, C and C++
- Automatically capture Godot errors, such as script and shader error
- GDScript stack traces with optional [local and member variable](/platforms/godot/configuration/options/#logger-include-variables) information
- Include surrounding script source code with events when available at runtime
- Automatic breadcrumbs for console output, such as `print()` statements
- [Enrich events](/platforms/godot/enriching-events/) with tags, breadcrumbs, contexts, and attachments
- Information about user configuration like GPU, CPU, platform and such
- [Filter and customize events](/platforms/godot/data-management/sensitive-data/#scrubbing-data) in `before_send` callback (in GDScript)
- [Log-file attachments](/platforms/godot/configuration/options/#attach-log) for events
- [Scene tree data attachments](/platforms/godot/enriching-events/view-hierarchy/) for events
- [Screenshot attachments](/platforms/godot/enriching-events/screenshots/) for events (experimental)
- [Release Health](/platforms/godot/configuration/releases/) to keep track of crash-free users and sessions
- [Event throttling](/platforms/godot/configuration/options/#logger-limits) to handle spammy errors
- Configure options in the Project Settings and/or in GDScript
