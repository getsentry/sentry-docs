Our SDK for Godot Engine builds on top of existing Sentry SDKs, extending them with Godot-specific features. It gives developers helpful hints for where and why an error or performance issue might have occurred.

**Features:**

- Native support for automatic crash error tracking on Windows, macOS and Linux using the [Native SDK](/platforms/native/) to support C and C++ with minidumps
- Enrich events with tags, breadcrumbs, contexts including custom ones
- Capture Godot errors, such as script and shader error
- Adding surrounding script source code if available
- Throttling options for spammy errors
- Filter and customize events in `before_send` callback (in GDScript)
- Attachment support for Godot logs
- Information about user configuration like GPU, CPU, platform and such
- Configure options in Project Settings and/or in GDScript
