<Expandable title="Are you developing with Turbopack?">

The Sentry SDK doesn't fully support `next dev --turbo` as Turbopack is still under development.

However, Sentry will work fine in your production builds.

Check the latest information on [Sentry's support for Turbopack on GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/8105).
