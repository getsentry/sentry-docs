Features:

- Automatic [Error Tracking](/product/issues/) with source maps for both JavaScript and TypeScript
- Automatic [Tracing](/product/performance/) for both the client and server
- Errors and Performance support for [Middleware](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-middleware) and [Edge routes](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions) in Vercel's edge runtime. Due to complexities with the runtime, some features of errors like stack traces may not be as expected. Requires <code>sentry.edge.config.js</code>, more info [here](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/manual-setup/#create-initialization-config-files)
- Events [enriched](/platforms/javascript/enriching-events/context/) with device data
- [Breadcrumbs](/platforms/javascript/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/) created for outgoing HTTP request with XHR and Fetch, and console logs
- [Release health](/product/releases/health/) for tracking crash-free users and sessions

<Note>

`next dev --turbo` is not supported while Turbopack is in beta. Running your devserver with Turbopack will cause the Sentry Next.js SDK not to be loaded in the browser. Data from serverside instrumentation will also be inaccurate or incomplete.
