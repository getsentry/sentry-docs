Features:

- Automatic [Error Tracking](/product/issues/) with source maps for both JavaScript and TypeScript
- Automatic [Tracing](/product/performance/) for both the client and server
- Errors and Performance support for [Middleware](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-middleware) and [Edge routes](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions) in Vercel's edge runtime. Due to complexities with the runtime, some features of errors like stack traces may not be as expected. Requires <code>sentry.edge.config.js</code>, more info [here](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/manual-setup/#create-initialization-config-files)
- Events [enriched](/platforms/javascript/enriching-events/context/) with device data
- [Breadcrumbs](/platforms/javascript/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/) created for outgoing HTTP request with XHR and Fetch, and console logs
- [Release health](/product/releases/health/) for tracking crash-free users and sessions

<Alert>

The Sentry SDK does not fully support `next dev --turbo` while Turbopack does not ship all the features required to run Sentry.

Currently, when you run your devserver with Turbopack, the Sentry Next.js SDK will not be loaded in the browser.
Keep this in mind when configuring the SDK.

Note that this only affects the devserver.
The Sentry SDK will run without issues when you do a production build, even if you develop locally with Turbopack.

To support the SDK in the browser with Turbopack, [follow the feature request for client-side instrumentation in the Next.js repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/69294).

You can track Sentry's Turbopack support in the [GitHub Issue in the Sentry SDK repository](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/8105).
