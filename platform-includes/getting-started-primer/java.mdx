Sentry's Java SDK enables capturing sessions for Release health as well as reporting messages and errors.

Sentry for Java is a collection of modules provided by Sentry; it supports Java 1.8 and above. At its core, Sentry for Java provides a raw client for sending events to Sentry. To begin, we **highly recommend** you use one of the logging libraries or framework integrations.
