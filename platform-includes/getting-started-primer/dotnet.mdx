The Sentry .NET SDK supports all recent versions of the .NET platform, and integrates well with a variety of popular frameworks and packages in the ecosystem. You can use it with applications written in C#, VB.NET, F#, and other .NET programming languages. It gives developers helpful hints for where and why an error or performance issue might have occurred.

This <PlatformLink to="/compatibility/">SDK is compatible</PlatformLink> with the latest .NET and .NET Core platforms, as well as .NET Standard 2.0 and .NET Framework 4.6.2 or newer. For older versions, such as .NET Framework 3.5, you may continue to use our <Link rel={`nofollow`} to={`/platforms/dotnet/legacy-sdk/`}>legacy SDK</Link>, until further notice.
