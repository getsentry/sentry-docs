Kotlin Multiplatform lets you write code once and use it on various platforms.
It makes building apps easier and more efficient by sharing common code, while still benefitting from native capabilities.

Sentry's Kotlin Multiplatform SDK builds on top of multiple Sentry SDKs, allowing developers to share code between platforms while being able to integrate Sentry's features into their applications.
Installing this SDK will enable native crash reporting and automatic breadcrumbs for app lifecycle and UI events.
