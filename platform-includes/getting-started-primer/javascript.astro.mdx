Sentry's Astro SDK enables automatic reporting of errors and performance data in your Astro application.
Our Astro integration instruments both the client as well as the server side of your Astro application.
This page walks you through adding Sentry to your Astro project, configuring it, adding readable stack traces, and verifying your setup.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following:

* You need a Sentry [account](https://sentry.io/signup/) and [project](/product/projects/)
* An Astro project that uses Astro `3.0.0` or newer.
* A Node runtime:
  - This SDK currently only works on Node runtimes (e.g. Node adapter, Vercel with Lambda functions).
    Non-Node runtimes, like Vercel's Edge runtime or Cloudflare Pages, are currently not supported.
* If you're using Astro's Netflify adapter (`@astrojs/netlify`), you need version `5.0.0` or newer.
