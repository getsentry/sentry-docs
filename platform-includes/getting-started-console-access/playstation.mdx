You can get started using Sentry in your PlayStation 5 games without any code changes or new releases, on both devkit and retail crashes.

It can be done directly inside of a Sentry project settings, once the middleware verification process is done.

Even though crash collection doesn't require a Sentry SDK, if you want to add additional context on your crash dumps,
or you want to capture non-fatal events, Sentry offers SDK support specifically for PlayStation.
It allows for adding additional context such as [breadcrumbs](/product/issues/issue-details/breadcrumbs/) and [tags](/product/issues/issue-details/#tags).

To start using Sentry in your PS5 games head over to the [Sentry page inside PlayStation Partners](https://game.develop.playstation.net/tm/verify/functionalsw) and confirm your developer status by clicking on *Confirm status*. We'll receive your request and get back to you with the next steps.
