## Add Readable Stack Traces to Errors

By default, React Router will minify your JavaScript and CSS files in production. This makes it difficult to debug errors. To make debugging easier, you can generate source maps and upload them to Sentry.

We recommend using [Sentry's Vite plugin](/platforms/javascript/sourcemaps/uploading/vite/) to upload sourcemaps.

Please refer to the <PlatformLink to="/sourcemaps">Source Maps Documentation</PlatformLink>, for more information.

For more advanced configuration, you can use [`sentry-cli`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cli) directly to upload source maps.
