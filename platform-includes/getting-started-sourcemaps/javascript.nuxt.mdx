## Add Readable Stack Traces to Errors

The Sentry Nuxt Module uses the [Sentry Vite Plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/vite-plugin) to upload source maps for both server and client builds.
This means that when you run a production build (`nuxt build`), source maps will be generated and uploaded to Sentry, so that you get readable stack traces in your Sentry issues.

To upload source maps, specify your Sentry auth token as well as your org and project slugs. Set them in the `sourceMapsUploadOptions` option
inside the `sentry` options of your `nuxt.config.ts`.

<Alert level="info">
  The module options inside `sentry` are only affecting the **build-time** of the SDK.

```javascript {filename:nuxt.config.ts} {3-9}
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ["@sentry/nuxt/module"],
  sentry: {
    sourceMapsUploadOptions: {
      org: "___ORG_SLUG___",
      project: "___PROJECT_SLUG___",
      authToken: "___ORG_AUTH_TOKEN___"
    }
  }
});
```
