## Add Readable Stack Traces to Errors

The Sentry Nuxt Module uses the [Sentry Vite Plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/vite-plugin) to upload source maps for both server and client builds.
This means that when you run a production build (`nuxt build`), source maps will be generated and uploaded to Sentry, so that you get readable stack traces in your Sentry issues.

To upload source maps, specify your Sentry auth token as well as your org and project slugs. Set them in the `sourceMapsUploadOptions` option
inside the `sentry` options of your `nuxt.config.ts`.

  The module options inside `sentry` are only affecting the **build-time** of the SDK.

```javascript {filename:nuxt.config.ts} {3-9}
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ["@sentry/nuxt/module"],
  sentry: {
    sourceMapsUploadOptions: {
      org: "___ORG_SLUG___",
      project: "___PROJECT_SLUG___",
      authToken: "___ORG_AUTH_TOKEN___"
    }
  }
});
```

To upload source maps, the Sentry Nuxt Module will automatically enable source map generation in your project if it is not already enabled.
However, you need to explicitly enable source map generation on the client-side. To do this, add the following code to your Nuxt configuration:

```javascript {filename:nuxt.config.ts} {2}
export default defineNuxtConfig({
    sourcemap: { client: true }
});
```

This step is necessary because Nuxt sets default values for source maps ([Nuxt docs](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/nuxt-config#sourcemap)), and the Sentry Nuxt Module keeps these settings when they are explicitly defined.
