## Add Readable Stack Traces to Errors

The Remix SDK provides a script that automatically creates a release and uploads sourcemaps. To generate sourcemaps with Remix, you need to call remix build with the `--sourcemap` option.

On release, call `sentry-upload-sourcemaps` to upload source maps and create a release. To see more details on how to use the command, call `sentry-upload-sourcemaps --help`.

For more advanced configuration, you can use [`sentry-cli`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cli) directly to upload sourcemaps.
