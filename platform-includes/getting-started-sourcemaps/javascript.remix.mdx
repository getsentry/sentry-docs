## Add Readable Stack Traces to Errors

By default, Remix will minify your JavaScript and CSS files in production. This makes it difficult to debug errors in production. To make debugging easier, you can generate source maps and upload them to Sentry.

Depending on your build setup, you can either use [Sentry's Vite plugin](/platforms/javascript/sourcemaps/uploading/vite/) or `sentry-upload-sourcemaps` script to upload sourcemaps.

Please refer to the <PlatformLink to="/sourcemaps">Sourcemaps Documentation</PlatformLink>, for more information.

For more advanced configuration, you can use [`sentry-cli`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cli) directly to upload sourcemaps.
