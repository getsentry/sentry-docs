```javascript {9,13,15-21}
// import Sentry from your framework SDK (e.g. @sentry/react) instead of @sentry/browser
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // This sets the sample rate to be 10%. You may want this to be 100% while
  // in development and sample at a lower rate in production
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,

  // If the entire session is not sampled, use the below sample rate to sample
  // sessions when an error occurs.
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,

  integrations: [
    Sentry.replayIntegration({
      // Additional SDK configuration goes in here, for example:
      maskAllText: true,
      blockAllMedia: true,
    }),
  ],
});
```

With the settings above, session replays with errors are always captured.
You can verify this by adding the following snippet anywhere in your code and running it:

```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
  throw new Error("Sentry Test Error");
});
```
### PII & Privacy Considerations

Personally identifiable information (PII), and privacy are important considerations when enabling Session Replay. There are several ways in which Sentry helps you avoid collecting PII:
- [Masking](/platforms/javascript/session-replay/privacy/#masking), which replaces the text content with something else (the default behavior being to replace each character with a *).
- Making [Network request, response bodies, and headers](/platforms/javascript/session-replay/privacy/#network-request-and-response-bodies-and-headers) an opt-in feature, because the best way to avoid getting PII into Sentry is by not adding URLs of endpoints that may contain PII.

While we have certain privacy considerations in place, Sentry's Session Replays allow you to set up the [privacy configurations](/platforms/javascript/session-replay/privacy/#privacy-configuration) that work best for your use case. For example, if you're working on a static website that's free of PII or other types of private data, you can opt out of the default text masking and image blocking settings.
To learn more about session replay privacy, [read our docs.](/platforms/javascript/session-replay/privacy/)

### Lazy-loading Replay

Once you've added the integration, Replay will start automatically. If you don't want to start it immediately (lazy-load it), you can use `addIntegration`:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  // Note, Replay is NOT instantiated below:
  integrations: [],
});

// Sometime later
const { replayIntegration } = await import("@sentry/browser");
Sentry.addIntegration(replayIntegration());
```
