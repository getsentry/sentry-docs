```javascript {8,14-20}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/angular-ivy";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // This sets the sample rate to be 10%. You may want this to be 100% while
  // in development and sample at a lower rate in production
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,

  // If the entire session is not sampled, use the below sample rate to sample
  // sessions when an error occurs.
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,

  integrations: [
    Sentry.replayIntegration({
      // Additional SDK configuration goes in here, for example:
      maskAllText: true,
      blockAllMedia: true,
    }),
  ],
});
```

With the settings above, session replays with errors are always captured.
You can verify this by triggering a test error somewhere in your Angular app, for example in your main app component:

```html {filename: app.component.html}
<button (click)="throwTestError()">Test Sentry Error</button>
```

Then, in your `app.component.ts` add:

```javascript {filename: app.component.ts}
public throwTestError(): void {
  throw new Error("Sentry Test Error");
}
```

### Lazy-loading Replay

Once you've added the integration, Replay will start automatically. If you don't want to start it immediately (lazy-load it), you can use `addIntegration`:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  // Note, Replay is NOT instantiated below:
  integrations: [],
});

// Sometime later
const { replayIntegration } = await import("@sentry/angular-ivy");
Sentry.addIntegration(replayIntegration());
```
