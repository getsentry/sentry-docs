Session replay is enabled by default if you use the SDK configuration in your `astro.config.mjs` file.

You can customize Replay sample rates like so:

```javascript {filename:astro.config.mjs} {8-9}
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
import sentry from "@sentry/astro";

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    sentry({
      dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
      replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.2, // defaults to 0.1
      replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0, // defaults to 1.0
    }),
  ],
});
```

If you have a <PlatformLink to="/manual-setup/#manual-sdk-initialization">custom SDK configuration file</PlatformLink> for the client side (`sentry.client.config.js`), add the Sentry `Replay` integration:

```javascript {filename:sentry.client.config.js} {5-7}
import * as sentry from "@sentry/astro";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,
  integrations: [Sentry.replayIntegration()],
});
```

<Alert level="warning">

Do not add the `Replay` integration to your server-side Sentry config file (`sentry.server.config.js`).
Session Replay can only be included on the client side.

### PII & Privacy Considerations

Personally identifiable information (PII) and privacy are important considerations when enabling Session Replay. There are multiple ways in which Sentry helps you avoid collecting PII, including:
- [Masking](/platforms/javascript/session-replay/privacy/#masking), which replaces the text content with something else -- the default behavior being to replace each character with a *.
- Making [network request, response bodies, and headers](/platforms/javascript/session-replay/privacy/#network-request-and-response-bodies-and-headers) an opt-in feature, because the best way to avoid getting PII into Sentry is by not adding URLs of endpoints that may contain PII.

While we have certain privacy considerations in place, Sentry's Session Replay allows you to set up the [privacy configurations](/platforms/javascript/session-replay/privacy/#privacy-configuration) that work best for your use case. For example, if you're working on a static website that's free of PII or other types of private data, you can opt out of the default text masking and image blocking settings.
To learn more about Session Replay privacy, [read our docs.](/platforms/javascript/session-replay/privacy/)

### Lazy-loading Replay

Once you've added the integration, Replay will start automatically. If you don't want to start it immediately (lazy-load it), you can use `addIntegration`:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  // Note, Replay is NOT instantiated below:
  integrations: [],
});

// Sometime later
import("@sentry/astro").then(lazyLoadedSentry => {
  Sentry.addIntegration(lazyLoadedSentry.replayIntegration());
});
```
