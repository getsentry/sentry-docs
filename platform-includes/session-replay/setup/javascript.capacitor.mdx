Several options are supported and passable using the integration constructor. See the [configuration documentation](/platforms/javascript/guides/capacitor/session-replay/configuration/) for more details. To set up the integration, add the following to your Sentry initialization:

<Note>
  The minimal supported version of Sentry's SDK for Capacitor is 0.11.0.
</Note>


```javascript {9,13,15-21}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/capacitor";
import { Replay } from "@sentry/replay";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // This sets the sample rate at 10%. You may want this to be 100% while
  // in development, then sample at a lower rate in production.
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,

  // If the entire session is not sampled, use the below sample rate to sample
  // sessions when an error occurs.
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,

  integrations: [
    replayIntegration({
      // Additional SDK configuration goes in here, for example:
      maskAllText: true,
      blockAllMedia: true,
    }),
  ],
});
```

Session replays with errors, will always be captured with the settings above.
You can verify this by adding the following snippet anywhere in your code and running it:

```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
  throw new Error("Sentry Test Error");
});
```

### PII & Privacy Considerations
Personally identifiable information (PII) and privacy are important considerations when enabling Session Replay. There are multiple ways in which Sentry helps you avoid collecting PII, including:
- [Masking](/platforms/javascript/session-replay/privacy/#masking), which replaces the text content with something else -- the default behavior being to replace each character with a *.
- Making [network request, response bodies, and headers](/platforms/javascript/session-replay/privacy/#network-request-and-response-bodies-and-headers) an opt-in feature, because the best way to avoid getting PII into Sentry is by not adding URLs of endpoints that may contain PII.

While we have certain privacy considerations in place, Sentry's Session Replay allows you to set up the [privacy configurations](/platforms/javascript/session-replay/privacy/#privacy-configuration) that work best for your use case. For example, if you're working on a static website that's free of PII or other types of private data, you can opt out of the default text masking and image blocking settings.
