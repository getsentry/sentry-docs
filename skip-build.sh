# This script is used to skip the build on Vercel process based on the changes in the repository.
# It depends on the `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEVELOPER_DOCS` environment variable to determine which app to check for changes.
# basically an exit code of 0 means the build will be skipped, and 1 means it will be built.
