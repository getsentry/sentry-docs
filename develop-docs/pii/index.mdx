title: PII and Data Scrubbing
---

**This document describes a configuration format that we would like to hide from the user eventually. The only reason this page still exists is because currently Relay accepts this format in alternative to regular data scrubbing settings.**

The following document explores the syntax and semantics of the configuration
for [Advanced Data Scrubbing] consumed and executed by [Relay]. Sometimes, this
is also referred to as PII scrubbing.

## A Basic Example

Say you have an exception message which, unfortunately, contains IP addresses
which are not supposed to be there. You'd write:

```json
{
  "applications": {
    "$string": ["@ip:replace"]
  }
}
```

It reads as "replace all IP addresses in all strings", or "apply `@ip:replace`
to all `$string` fields".

`@ip:replace` is called a rule, and `$string` is a <Link
to="/pii/selectors/">selector</Link>.

## Built-in Rules

The following rules exist by default:

- `@ip:replace` and `@ip:hash` for replacing IP addresses.
- `@imei:replace` and `@imei:hash` for replacing IMEIs
- `@mac:replace`, `@mac:mask` and `@mac:hash` for matching MAC addresses
- `@email:mask`, `@email:replace` and `@email:hash` for matching email addresses
- `@creditcard:mask`, `@creditcard:replace` and `@creditcard:hash` for matching
  creditcard numbers
- `@userpath:replace` and `@userpath:hash` for matching local paths (e.g.
  `C:/Users/foo/`)
- `@password:remove` for removing passwords. In this case we're pattern matching
  against the field's key, whether it contains `password`, `credentials` or
  similar strings.
- `@anything:remove`, `@anything:replace` and `@anything:hash` for removing,
  replacing or hashing any value. It is essentially equivalent to a
  wildcard-regex, but it will also match much more than strings.

## Writing Your Own Rules

Rules generally consist of two parts:

- _Rule types_ describe what to match. See <Link to="/pii/types/">PII Rule
  Types</Link> for an exhaustive list.
- _Rule redaction methods_ describe what to do with the match. See <Link
  to="/pii/methods/">PII Redaction Methods</Link> for a list.

Each page comes with examples. Try those examples out by pasting them into the
"PII config" column of [Piinguin] and clicking on fields to get suggestions.

## Interactive Editing

The easiest way to go about this is if you already have a raw JSON payload from
some SDK. Go to our PII config editor [Piinguin], and:

1. Paste in a raw event
2. Click on data you want eliminated
3. Paste in other payloads and see if they look fine, go to step **2** if
   necessary.

After iterating on the config, paste it back into the project config located at
`.relay/projects/<PROJECT_ID>.json`

For example:

```json
{
  "publicKeys": [
    {
      "publicKey": "___PUBLIC_KEY___",
      "isEnabled": true
    }
  ],
  "config": {
    "allowedDomains": ["*"],
    "piiConfig": {
      "rules": {
        "device_id": {
          "type": "pattern",
          "pattern": "d/[a-f0-9]{12}",
          "redaction": {
            "method": "hash"
          }
        }
      },
      "applications": {
        "freeform": ["device_id"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
