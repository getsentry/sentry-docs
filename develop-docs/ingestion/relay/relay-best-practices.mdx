title: Relay Best Practices
sidebar_order: 10
---

Relay is a critical component in Sentry's infrastructure handling hundreds of thousands of requests per second.
To make sure your changes to Relay go smoothly, there are some best practices to follow.

For general Rust development best practices, make sure you read the [Rust Development](/engineering-practices/rust/)
document.


## Forward Compatibility

Make sure changes to the event protocol and APIs are forward-compatible. Relay should not drop
or truncate data it does not understand. It is a supported use-case to have customers running
outdated Relays but up-to-date SDKs.


## Feature Gate new Functionality


Consider making your new feature conditional. Not only does this allow a gradual roll-out, but can also
function as a kill-switch when something goes wrong.


### Sentry Features

Sentry features are best used for new product features. They can be gradually rolled out to a subset
of organizations and projects.


### Global Config

Kill-switches, sample- and rollout-rates can also be configured via "global config". Global config
is a simple mechanism to propagate a dynamic configuration from Sentry to Relay.

Global config works very well for technical rollouts and kill-switches.


### Relay Config

The relay configuration file can also be used to feature gate functionality. This is best used
for configuration which is environment specific or fundamental to how Relay operates and should not
be used for product features.


## Regular expressions

Regular expressions are a powerful tool, they are well known and also extremely performant.
But they aren't always the right choice for Relay.

Some of the listed issues are specific to the [regex](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/) Rust crate Relay uses
and others apply to regular expressions in general.

<Alert title="Important">
Review the [Rust crate's documentation](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#overview) carefully before introducing a Regex.
</Alert>


### Compiling

Compiling a Regex is quite costly.

- Do not compile a regular expression for every element that is processed.
- Always cache regular expressions.

Static regular expressions can be cached using [`std::sync::LazyLock`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/std/sync/struct.LazyLock.html).


### User defined Regular Expressions

Avoid exposing regular expressions to users. Instead, consider using a targeted domain specific language or
glob like patterns for which Relay has good support.

<Alert level="warning" title="Important">
User-defined regexes are prone to leading to unexpected CPU or memory usage.
Review the [Untrusted Input](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#untrusted-input) section in the regex crate documentation
carefully.
</Alert>


### Avoid Unicode

When not strictly necessary, specify match groups without Unicode support. For example, `\w` matches around 140000
distinct code points, when you only need to match ASCII consider using explicit groups `[0-9A-Za-z_]` instead or disable Unicode `(?-u:\w)`
for the group.


## (De-)Serialization

(De-)Serialization of JSON, protobuf, message-pack uses a considerable amount of CPU and memory. Be mindful when and where
you (de-)serialize data.

Relay's architecture requires all CPU heavy operations to be done on a dedicated thread pool, which is used in the so called
[processor service](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/blob/master/relay-server/src/services/processor.rs).


## Data Structures

All data structures come with a cost, consider using the correct data structure for your workload.

- A `BTreeMap` may be more performant than a `HashMap` for small amounts of data.
- Use `ahash` (through `hashbrown::HashMap`) as hasher for a `HashMap` to reduce the hashing overhead for high throughput
`HashMap`'s.
- Use `smallvec` over `Vec` when your data is likely to be small.
- Avoid iterating through large collections in regular intervals, consider using a [priority queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue) or
[heap](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.BinaryHeap.html) instead.


## CPU and Memory constraints

Relay operates on untrusted user input, make sure there are enough precautions taken to avoid a denial of service
attack.

- Apply size limits to payloads.
- Limit memory consumption in Relay. For example, also apply size limits to decompression, not just the incoming compressed data.
- Avoid exponential algorithms, often there are better data structures and algorithms available. If this is not possible, set a limit.


## Don't panic

Relay needs to be able to handle any user input without a [panic](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.panic.html).
Always return useful errors when encountering unexpected or malformed inputs. This improves debuggability,
guarantees stability and generates the necessary outcomes.
