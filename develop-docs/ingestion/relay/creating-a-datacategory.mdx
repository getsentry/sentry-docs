Adding a new data category to Sentry requires a modification to [Relay](https://github.com/getsentry/relay).
Relay provides a Python library `sentry-relay`, which must be updated before a new data category can be imported
in Sentry.


## Adding the new Data Category to Relay


You need to be able to develop on Relay, the [README](https://github.com/getsentry/relay?tab=readme-ov-file#development),
describes how to setup a local development environment for Relay.


1. Modify `relay-base-schema/src/data_category.rs` and add your data category. Make sure to give it a good name
and document the purpose of the data category. Don't forget to fill out `DataCategory::name`  and `DataCategory::from_name`.
2. Define how your data category should be rate limited in `relay-quotas/src/quota.rs`, by modifying `CategoryUnit::from`.
3. Update `sentry-relay` by running `make header` in the `relay-cabi/` directory.
4. Add your data category to the Relay `CHANGELOG.md`.
5. Add your data category to the Python `py/CHANGELOG.md`.

You can also use this [Example PR](https://github.com/getsentry/relay?tab=readme-ov-file#development) as a reference.


## Creating a `sentry-relay` Release


To release a new version of `sentry-relay` you have to trigger the [Release Library](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/actions/workflows/release_library.yml)
workflow with the next version.

New data categories are always released as a new patch version, for example if the current version is `0.7.12` you
would trigger the workflow with version `0.7.13`.

Double and tripple check the version before triggering the workflow.

## Updating Sentry

After the library has been published you can update `sentry-relay` in Sentry and use your new data category!
