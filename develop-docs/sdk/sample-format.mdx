title: Sample format
sidebar_order: 20

This document defines the Sample format used by Sentry to ingest profiles. This
document is meant for Sentry SDK developers and maintainers of the profile
ingestion pipeline.

This format is meant to be cross platform and allow to represent samples
collected by a profiler.

A profile should always be associated with a transaction.

## Data Model

### Profile metadata

`debug_meta`

: *Object, required on native platforms.* This carry the same payload as <Link
to="/sdk/event-payloads/sdk/">`debug_meta` interface</Link>. It is required to
have it for native platforms in order to symbolicate, otherwise you can omit it.

`device`

: *Object, required.* This contains a few fields to describe the device the
profiler is running on.

It can have the following attributes:
- `architecture`: *String, required.*
- `is_emulator`: *Boolean, optional.* Indicates if the application is running in an emulator. Usually only set for mobile platforms.
- `locale`: *String, optional.* Contains the local of the system. Usually only set for a mobile platforms.
- `manufacturer`: *String, optional.* Contains the manufacturer of the device. Usually only set for a mobile platforms.
- `model`: *String, optional.* Contains the model of the device. Usually only set for a mobile platforms.

```json
{
  "device": {
    "architecture": "arm64e",
    "is_emulator": true,
    "locale": "en_US",
    "manufacturer": "Apple",
    "model": "iPhone14,8"
  }
}
```

`environment`

: *String, recommended.* The environment name, such as `production` or
`staging`. The default value should be `production`.

`event_id`

: *String, required.* Hexadecimal string representing a uuid4 value. The length
is exactly 32 characters. Dashes are not allowed. Has to be lowercase.

`measurements`

: *Object, optional.* This field contains various metrics measured during the profile collection.

A measurement is a collection of measurement values and a unit for those values.
It will only be shown in the UI if it's been integrated. Right now, we only
support 2 metrics:
- `frozen_frame_renders`: when a frozen frame was detected.
- `slow_frame_renders`: when a slow frame was detected.

A measurement value can contain the following attributes:
- `elapsed_since_start_ns`: number of nanoseconds since the start of the profile
  (stored in `timestamp`).
- `value`: value for the measurement, as a `float64`. We accept `float64`
  formatted as `string` as well.

These are the values accepted for `unit`:
- `nanosecond`
- `ns`
- `hertz`
- `hz`
- `byte`
- `percent`

```json
{
  "cpu_0": {
    "unit": "percent",
    "values": {
      "elapsed_since_start_ns: "1234567890",
      "value": 12.64,
    }
  }
}
```

`os`

: *Object, required.* Contains information about the OS.


It can have the following attributes:
- `name`: *String, required.* Contains the OS name.
- `version`: *String, required.* Contains the OS version.
- `build_number`: *String, optional.* Only set it for `cocoa` platform.

```json
{
 "os": {
    "build_number": "20D47",
    "name": "iOS",
    "version": "16.3",
  }
}
```

`platform`

: *String, required.* This value represents the platform the SDK is submitting
from.

Acceptable values are:
- `cocoa`
- `node`
- `python`
- `rust`

`profile`

: *Object, required.* It contains all the raw data collected when profiling. See
[profile data](#profile-data).

`release`

: *String, required.* The release version of the application.

**Release versions must be unique across all projects in your organization**.
This value can be the git SHA for the given project, or a product identifier
with a semantic version (suggested format `my-project-name@1.0.0`).

`runtime`

: *Object, optional.* Contains information about the runtime. Usually only used
for platforms allowing several runtimes.

It can have the following attributes:
- `name`
- `version`

```json
{
  "runtime": {
    "name": "CPython",
    "version": "3.11.2"
  }
}
```

`timestamp`

: *String, recommended.* The timestamp when the profile was captured by the SDK
as [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) format. This is meant to be
the anchor for all relative timestamps captured for the profile.

Ideally, this will be the same as the field `start_timestamp` on the transaction
so all relative timestamps for transaction and profile can be both from the same
reference point and we don't need to correct relative timestamps.

If for some reasons, the profiler implementation doesn't allow that, set it to
the closest time to the profiler start (or to whatever the profiler gives you as
a profile start timestamp) and it will be used to align with the transaction
later on.

`transaction`

: *Object, required.* Contains information about the transaction it is
associated with.

It can have the following attributes:
- `id`: *String, required.* Contains the transaction ID.
- `name`: *String, required.* Contains the name of the transaction.
- `trace_id`: *String, required.* Contains the trace ID the transaction is part
  of.
- `active_thread_id`: *String, required.* Contains the thread ID the transaction
  was started on as `uint64` converted to a string. On mobile, this is usually
  the main thread.

`version`

: *String, required.* Represents the version of the Sample format.

Acceptable values are:
- `"1"`

### Profile data

The profile data consists of
- sample, which specifies the start time, their corresponding thread and a stack,
- stacks, which are lists of frames,
- frames, which identify the function and/or line of code for each item in a stacktrace,
- thread metadata, with info about threads.

The selected format is trying to keep the amount of data we transfer to the server as limited as possible.

```json
{
  "profile": {
    "samples": [
      { ... },
      ...
    ],
    "stacks": [
      [ ... ],
      ...
    ],
    "frames": [
      { ... },
      ...
    ],
    "thread_metadata": {
      "259": {
        ...
      }
    }
  }
}
```

When collecting a stack trace, you will:
1. Capture the stack trace.
2. Capture a timestamp relative to the start of the profile (set in the
`timestamp` field).
3. Capture the thread ID where this stack trace was captured.
4. Create a list of indices for each frames (add it to the frame list if needed
or use the existing frame's index).
5. Check if that stack exists in the list of stacks and if it doesn't, add it to the list of stacks
6. Create a sample containing the thread ID, the relative timestamp and the
stack ID.

You should collect samples at a frequency of 101 Hz, or roughly once every 10
milliseconds.

`samples`

: *List, required* Contains a list of sample object captured during execution.
Each sample can contain the following attributes:

- `elapsed_since_start_ns`: *String, required.* Contains the relative timestamp
  in nanoseconds since the value contained in the `timestamp` field when the
  sample was captured. It's meant to be a `uint64` formatted as a `string`, a `float` won't be accepted.
- `stack_id`: *Integer, required.* Contains the stack index from the `stacks` list.
- `thread_id`: *String, required.* Contains the thread ID on which the sample was captured.

```json
{
  "elapsed_since_start_ns": "1234567890",
  "stack_id": 1,
  "thread_id": "259",
}
```

`stacks`

: *List, required*. Contains a list of frame indices forming a stack trace.

Stacks should be ordered from outermost to innermost frame.

`frames`

: *List, required*. Contains a list of frame objects (see [Frame
Attributes](/sdk/event-payloads/stacktrace/#frame-attributes)).

Each object should contain at least a `filename`, `function` or
`instruction_addr` attribute. All values are optional, but recommended.

For native platforms (`cocoa` or `rust` for example), `instruction_addr` is
required in order to be able to symbolicate and get more info about the frame.

For the rest of the platforms, whatever is passed here will travel to the
frontend and whatever is available can be used to show more or less information.

`thread_metadata`

: *Object, required.* Contains an object with a field for each thread ID
detected during runtime.

This object can contain these attributes:
- `name`: name of the thread.
- `priority`: the priority of the thread.

This information will be used on the flamechart to power the thread selector.

```json
{
  "thread_metadata": {
    "259": {
      "name": "com.apple.main-thread",
      "priority": 31
    }
  }
}
```

## Validation

We will reject a profile in Relay for several reasons:
- profile data is missing (no frame, no sample, no stack)
- not enough samples (we need at least 2 samples)
- no transaction associated with the profile
- any of the metadata required is missing
- size of the profile exceeds 50MB

It is suggested to validate these conditions before sending the profile.

## Ingestion

After this payload is generated, serialize it as JSON, pack it into an
Envelope as an ItemType `"profile"` and send it to Relay.
