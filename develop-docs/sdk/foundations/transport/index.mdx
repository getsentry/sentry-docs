description: How SDKs send data to Sentry - envelope format, authentication, compression, and rate limiting.

The transport layer handles all communication between an SDK and the Sentry server. SDKs serialize data into [envelopes](envelopes/), [authenticate](authentication/) requests using DSN-derived credentials, optionally [compress](compression/) payloads, and respect [rate limits](rate-limiting/) communicated via response headers.

## Reading the Response

On success, you will receive an HTTP response from the server containing a JSON payload with information on the submitted payload:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id": "fc6d8c0c43fc4630ad850ee518f1b9d0"
}
```

**Always** check for a `200` response, which confirms the message was delivered. A small level of validation happens immediately that may result in a different response code (and message).

## Handling Server Errors

SDKs **MUST** honor the `429` status code and not attempt sending until the `Retry-After` kicks in. SDKs **SHOULD** drop events if Sentry is unavailable instead of retrying.

To debug an error during development, inspect the response headers and response body. For example, you may get a response similar to:

```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json
X-Sentry-Error: failed to read request body

{
  "detail":"failed to read request body",
  "causes":[
    "failed to decode zlib payload",
    "corrupt deflate stream"
  ]
}
```

The `X-Sentry-Error` header and response body will not always contain a message, but they can still be helpful in debugging clients. When emitted, they will contain a precise error message, which is useful to identify root cause.

<Alert title="Note">
We do not recommend that SDKs retry event submissions automatically on error — not even if `Retry-After` is declared in the response headers. If a request fails once, it is very likely to fail again on the next attempt. Retrying too often may cause further rate limiting or blocking by the Sentry server.
