title: Envelope Items
sidebar_order: 80
---

Each Envelope consists of headers and a potentially empty list of Items, each
with their own headers. Which Headers are required depends on the Items in an
Envelope. This section describes all Item types and their respective required
headers. It is worth noting that the list of Item types doesn't match the data
categories used for [rate limiting](/sdk/foundations/transport/rate-limiting/#definitions) and
client reports.

The type of an Item is declared in the `type` header, as well as the payload
size in `length`. See Serialization Format for a list of common Item headers.
The headers described in this section are **in addition to the common headers**.

### Event

Item type `"event"`. This Item contains an error or default [event payload](/sdk/foundations/transport/event-payloads/)
encoded in JSON.

**Constraints:**

- This Item may occur at most once per Envelope.
- This Item is mutually exclusive with `"transaction"` Items.

**Envelope Headers:**

`event_id`

: **UUID String, required.** Corresponds to the `event_id` field of the event
payload. Clients are required to generate an event identifier ahead of time
and set it at least in the Envelope headers. If the identifier mismatches
between the Envelope and payload, the Envelope header takes precedence.

**Additional Item Headers:**

_None_

### Transaction

Item type `"transaction"`. This Item contains a transaction payload encoded
in JSON.

**Constraints:**

- This Item may occur at most once per Envelope.
- This Item is mutually exclusive with `"event"` Items.

**Envelope Headers:**

`event_id`

: **UUID String, required.** Corresponds to the `event_id` field of the
transaction payload. Clients are required to generate an event identifier
ahead of time and set it at least in the Envelope headers. If the identifier
mismatches between the Envelope and payload, the Envelope header takes
precedence.

**Additional Item Headers:**

_None_

### Attachment

Item type `"attachment"`. See the [Attachments](/sdk/telemetry/attachments/) spec for full documentation of standard attachments, attachment placeholders, and trace attachments.


### Check-Ins

Item type `"check_in"` contains a check-in payload encoded as JSON.

See the <Link to="/sdk/telemetry/check-ins/">Check-Ins</Link> documentation for the payload
details.

**Constraints:**

- This Item may occur at most once per Envelope.
- This Item can either be included in an Envelope with other Items, or it may be sent by itself.

**Envelope Headers:**

_None_

**Additional Item Headers:**

_None_

### Reserved Types

Reserved types may not be written by any implementation. They are reserved for
future or internal use. This is the exhaustive list of reserved Item types:

- `security`
- `unreal_report`
- `form_data`
