## Overview

Integrations extend SDK functionality in a modular way. The [Client](/sdk/foundations/client/) **MUST** own integration instances and call their lifecycle methods.

Users configure integrations via the `integrations` option in `Sentry.init()`.

Related specs:
- [Client](/sdk/foundations/client/) — client lifecycle and event pipeline
- [HTTP Client Integration](/sdk/foundations/client/integrations/http-client) — HTTP client instrumentation guidelines
- [GraphQL Integration](/sdk/foundations/client/integrations/graphql) — GraphQL client instrumentation guidelines
- [Feature Flags Integration](/sdk/foundations/client/integrations/feature-flags) — feature flag tracking guidelines

## Behavior

<SpecSection id="integration-interface" status="stable" since="1.0.0">

### Integration Interface

The recommended integration interface (language-specific variations apply):

| Method | When Called | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `setupOnce()` | Once globally, for the first Client | Global side effects (monkey-patching, global handlers). |
| `setup(client)` | Per Client | Client-specific setup. Preferred over `setupOnce` for most work. |
| `afterAllSetup(client)` | After all integrations' `setup` | Work that depends on other integrations being set up. |
| `preprocessEvent(event, hint, client)` | Before event processors | Modify the event before other processing. |
| `processEvent(event, hint, client)` | During event pipeline | Process the event. Return `null` to discard. |

</SpecSection>

<SpecSection id="integration-configuration" status="stable" since="1.0.0">

### Integration Configuration

Users configure integrations via the `integrations` option:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  integrations: [Sentry.browserTracingIntegration()],
});
```

`Sentry.init()` **MUST** enable a set of default integrations that define baseline functionality. SDKs **MUST** expose a way to disable default integrations individually or entirely.

</SpecSection>

<SpecSection id="default-integration-guidelines" status="stable" since="1.0.0">

### Default Integration Guidelines

New default integrations **SHOULD**:
- Be lightweight — not add significant overhead
- Be well-tested across all supported environments
- Not create a high volume of new data (spans, transactions) without user opt-in

Integrations that create high data volume or have potential compatibility issues **SHOULD** be opt-in and only made default in a major version.
