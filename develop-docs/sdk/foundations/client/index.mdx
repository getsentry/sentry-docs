## Overview

The Client is the SDK component responsible for building Sentry events from captured data and dispatching them to the [Transport](/sdk/foundations/transport/). It is configured once during `Sentry.init()` and manages the [integration](/sdk/foundations/client/integrations/) lifecycle.

The Client is **stateless** with respect to contextual data — it receives the [Scope](/sdk/foundations/state-management/scopes/) at capture time and merges scope data into the event. The Client does hold configuration (options) and owns its transport and integrations.

In the [Hub & Scope](/sdk/foundations/state-management/hub-and-scope/) model, the Client was bound to a Hub. In the current [Scopes](/sdk/foundations/state-management/scopes/) model, the Client is resolved via the scope chain.

Related specs:
- [Configuration](/sdk/foundations/client/configuration/) — client options, environment variables, debug mode, sampling
- [Integrations](/sdk/foundations/client/integrations/) — integration interface, lifecycle, and defaults
- [Hooks](/sdk/foundations/client/hooks/) — lifecycle hooks, before_send, before_breadcrumb
- [Scopes](/sdk/foundations/state-management/scopes/) — scope chain and client resolution
- [Transport](/sdk/foundations/transport/) — envelope delivery
- [Envelopes](/sdk/foundations/transport/envelopes/) — wire format
- [Attributes](/sdk/foundations/state-management/scopes/attributes) — attribute type system

## Concepts

- **Stateless**: The Client does not hold contextual data (tags, breadcrumbs, user). All contextual data comes from scopes, which are passed to the Client at capture time.

- **Transport delegation**: The Client builds the event; the Transport sends it. The Client **MUST NOT** implement network I/O directly — it delegates to its Transport (or [TelemetryProcessor](/sdk/foundations/processing/telemetry-processor/), if present).

- **NoOpClient**: A Client that performs no operations. Present on the global scope before `Sentry.init()` is called, ensuring that `getClient()` never returns `null`.

- **Disabled SDK**: The SDK is considered disabled when the Client has no transport, or when no DSN is configured. In this state, event processors, `configure_scope` callbacks, and breadcrumb recording **SHOULD NOT** be invoked.

## Behavior

<SpecSection id="client-lifecycle" status="stable" since="1.0.0">

### Client Lifecycle

#### Initialization

`Sentry.init(options)` **MUST** create a Client, configure its transport, and set up integrations. The Client is then set on the global scope, replacing the NoOpClient.

Before `Sentry.init()` is called, a NoOpClient **MUST** be present on the global scope. (since 2.0.0)

SDKs **MUST** accept an empty DSN as valid configuration. If initialized with an empty or missing DSN, the SDK **MUST NOT** send any data over the network. Depending on the platform, the SDK **MAY** reduce its runtime footprint to a minimum.

Calling `Sentry.init()` multiple times is permitted for testing. Behavior in production beyond application startup is undefined.

#### Active State

The Client is considered **active** when it has a configured transport. When active, the Client processes captured events through the [event pipeline](#event-pipeline).

#### Shutdown

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `close(timeout)` | Flush the transport queue for up to `timeout` seconds. The Client **SHOULD** be disabled or disposed after close returns. |
| `flush(timeout)` | Flush the transport queue for up to `timeout` seconds. The Client remains usable. |

Both methods **MUST** block for at most `timeout` seconds. If the transport includes a [TelemetryProcessor](/sdk/foundations/processing/telemetry-processor/), flushing **MUST** first forward all buffered items to the transport, then flush the transport itself.

### Client Resolution

A Client **MUST** always be available — `getClient()` **MUST NOT** return `null`.

Client resolution walks the scope chain:

1. Check the current scope
2. Check the isolation scope
3. Check the global scope
4. Fall back to NoOpClient (should not happen if `init()` was called)

Users **MAY** bind a different Client to any scope via `scope.setClient(client)`.

See [Scopes: Client Resolution](/sdk/foundations/state-management/scopes/#client-resolution) for details.

</SpecSection>

<SpecSection id="event-pipeline" status="stable" since="1.0.0">

### Event Pipeline

When `captureEvent`, `captureException`, or `captureMessage` is called, the Client processes the event through the following pipeline. The event **MAY** be discarded at any stage, stopping further processing.

1. **Disabled check**: If the SDK is disabled (no transport / no DSN), discard immediately.
2. **Sampling**: Apply the configured `sample_rate`. Events **MAY** be randomly discarded. When discarded, the Client **MUST** record a [client report](/sdk/telemetry/client-reports/) with discard reason `sample_rate`.
3. **Scope application**: Obtain the current, isolation, and global scopes. Merge scope data onto the event in the [defined order](/sdk/foundations/state-management/scopes/#applying-scope-data-to-events). Invoke event processors in registration order. Any processor returning `null` discards the event (client report reason: `event_processor`).
4. **`before_send` hook**: Invoke the user-configured callback. Returning `null` discards the event (client report reason: `before_send`). This hook **MUST** only apply to error events. For transactions, use `before_send_transaction`. For logs, use `before_send_log`. See [Hooks](/sdk/foundations/client/hooks/) for details.
5. **Transport**: Pass the event to the transport (or TelemetryProcessor). The transport **MAY** discard due to missing DSN, full queue, or [rate limiting](/sdk/expected-features/rate-limiting/).
