## Overview

Scopes manage contextual data (tags, breadcrumbs, user, context) that the SDK attaches to events, spans, logs, and metrics. The current model uses three scope types with copy-on-write semantics, replacing the older [Hub](/sdk/foundations/data-model/hub/)-based scope stack.

Related specs:
- [Hub](/sdk/foundations/data-model/hub/) — the deprecated predecessor (v1)
- [Hub & Scope Refactoring](/sdk/miscellaneous/hub_and_scope_refactoring/) — migration guide
- [Attributes](/sdk/telemetry/attributes) — attribute structure and types

## Legacy: Hub-Based Scope (v1)

<SpecSection id="v1-hub-scope" status="deprecated" since="1.0.0" superseded_by="sdk/foundations/data-model/scopes#v2-three-scope-model">

In v1, the SDK used a single mutable `Scope` managed by a [Hub](/sdk/foundations/data-model/hub/). The Hub maintained a stack of `(Scope, Client)` pairs. Users called `pushScope()` / `popScope()` or `configureScope()` to manage context.

This model had problems with OpenTelemetry compatibility, async context propagation, and scope leaking. See the [Hub](/sdk/foundations/data-model/hub/) spec for details.

</SpecSection>

---

## Three-Scope Model (v2)

<SpecSection id="v2-three-scope-model" status="stable" since="2.0.0">

The implementation in each SDK **MUST** consist of three types of scopes:

- The global scope
- The isolation scope
- The current scope

Users **MUST** be able to add data such as `tags`, `breadcrumbs`, and `context` to any scope, regardless of its type.

</SpecSection>

### Global Scope

<SpecSection id="global-scope" status="stable" since="2.0.0">

The global scope functions as a persistent global variable throughout the application's execution. Any data assigned to this scope is automatically applied to **all** events emitted by the SDK.

It is typically used to store application-wide data, such as the `release`, `environment`, and similar context.

</SpecSection>

### Isolation Scope

<SpecSection id="isolation-scope" status="stable" since="2.0.0">

The isolation scope **MUST** contain data specific to the current execution context: a single request (on a server), a single tab (in a browser), or a single user session (on mobile). Top-level SDK APIs, such as `sentry.setTag()` and `sentry.setContext()` **MUST** write to the isolation scope.

The isolation scope **SHOULD** be implemented using a context variable, thread-local storage, async-local storage, or an equivalent mechanism appropriate for the platform.

SDK integrations **MUST** handle the forking of isolation scopes automatically. Users **MUST NOT** need to manage or be concerned with the details of scope isolation or its forking process.

</SpecSection>

### Current Scope

<SpecSection id="current-scope" status="stable" since="2.0.0">

The current scope **MUST** maintain data for the active span. When a new span is started, the current scope of the parent span is forked (i.e., duplicated), transferring all data from the parent span to the new span. This allows modifications or additions specific to the new span without affecting the parent span. This behavior aligns with a "copy-on-write" model.

Any changes made to the current scope after forking **MUST NOT** impact the forked scope.

The current scope **SHOULD** be implemented using a context variable, thread-local storage, async-local storage, or an equivalent mechanism appropriate for the platform.

Users **MAY** fork the current scope explicitly by invoking `sentry.withScope()` or implicitly by starting a new span.

</SpecSection>

---

## Applying Scope Data to Events

<SpecSection id="scope-data-merge" status="stable" since="2.0.0">

Data from all three scope types **MUST** be merged in a specific order before being applied to an event. The process is as follows:

1. data from the global scope is...
2. merged with data from the isolation scope, which is...
3. merged with data from the current scope, which is ...
4. applied to the event

## Scope Methods

### Setting Attributes

<SpecSection id="scope-set-attributes" status="stable" since="2.2.0">

Users **MUST** be able to attach attributes to any scope using a dedicated method (e.g., `scope.setAttributes()` or `scope.setAttribute()`). These attributes follow the structure defined in the [Attributes](/sdk/telemetry/attributes) documentation.

Attributes are key-value pairs where each value is either an attribute value or an object containing:

- `value`: The actual attribute value, which **MUST** match the specified type
- `unit` (optional): The unit of measurement. See [Units](/sdk/telemetry/attributes#units) for the full list of supported units.
  - SDKs **MAY** delay adding support for units for the moment, but **MUST** be able to do so at a later date without a breaking change.
- `type` (optional): The type of the attribute. See [Attributes](/sdk/telemetry/attributes) for the full list. SDKs **SHOULD NOT** expose this to users if they can reliably infer the type from the value. If not, SDKs **MAY** allow or require users to set the `type` explicitly.

#### Example Usage

```javascript
Sentry.getGlobalScope().setAttributes({
  "app.feature_flag.enabled": true,
  "app.session_duration": {
    value: 3600,
    unit: "second"
  }
});
```

```python
sentry_sdk.get_global_scope().set_attributes({
    "app.feature_flag.enabled": True,
    "app.session_duration": {
        "value": 3600,
        "unit": "s"
    }
})
```

#### Method Signature

The method **SHOULD** accept a dictionary/map/object where:
- Keys are attribute names (strings)
- Values are either directly values or attribute objects/dictionaries with `value`, and optionally `unit` properties (see [example](#example-usage)).
- The SDK **SHOULD** infer the `type` of the attribute at serialization time to spare users from setting a (potentially incorrect) `type`. Depending on platform or constraints, the SDK **MAY** instead also allow or require users to set the `type` explicitly.

</SpecSection>

### Attribute Behavior

<SpecSection id="scope-attribute-behavior" status="stable" since="2.4.0">

- Attributes set on the global scope **MUST** be applied to all logs and metrics
- Attributes set on the isolation scope **MUST** be applied to all logs and metrics in that execution context
- Attributes set on the current scope **MUST** be applied only to the logs and metrics that are captured while that current scope is active
- When the same attribute key exists in multiple scopes, the more specific scope's value takes precedence (current > isolation > global)
- When the same attribute key exists on the current log or metric, it **MUST** take precedence over an attribute with the same key set on any scope (log/metric > current > isolation > global)
- The SDK **SHOULD** keep the attribute format consistent with the user-set format until user-provided processing callbacks like `before_send_log` have been called. This ensures compatibility with already existing callbacks and avoids unexpected changes to the attribute format.
- Calling `scope.clear()` **MUST** remove all attributes from the corresponding scope.

See [Attributes](/sdk/telemetry/attributes) for detailed information about attribute structure, supported types, units, and common attribute keys. Also see [Sentry Conventions](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-conventions/) for the complete attribute registry.

</SpecSection>

### Removing Attributes

<SpecSection id="scope-remove-attributes" status="stable" since="2.3.0">

Users **MUST** be able to remove attributes set on any scope using a dedicated method, e.g. `scope.removeAttribute()`.

#### Example Usage

```javascript
Sentry.getGlobalScope().removeAttribute('app.feature_flag.enabled');
```

```python
sentry_sdk.get_global_scope().remove_attribute('app.feature_flag.enabled')
```

</SpecSection>
