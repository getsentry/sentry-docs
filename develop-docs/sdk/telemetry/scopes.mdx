The implementation in each SDK MUST consist of three types of scopes:

- The global scope
- The isolation scope
- The current scope

Users MUST be able to add data such as `tags`, `breadcrumbs`, and `context` to any scope, regardless of its type.

## Choosing the Right Scope

### Global Scope

The global scope functions as a persistent global variable throughout the application's execution. Any data assigned to this scope is automatically applied to **all** events emitted by the SDK.

It is typically used to store application-wide data, such as the `release`, `environment`, and similar context.

### Isolation Scope

The isolation scope MUST contain data specific to the current execution context: a single request (on a server), a single tab (in a browser), or a single user session (on mobile). Top-level SDK APIs, such as `sentry.setTag()` and `sentry.setContext()` MUST write to the isolation scope.

The isolation scope SHOULD be implemented using a context variable, thread-local storage, async-local storage, or an equivalent mechanism appropriate for the platform.

SDK integrations MUST handle the forking of isolation scopes automatically. Users MUST NOT need to manage or be concerned with the details of scope isolation or its forking process.

### Current Scope

The current scope MUST maintain data for the active span. When a new span is started, the current scope of the parent span is forked (i.e., duplicated), transferring all data from the parent span to the new span. This allows modifications or additions specific to the new span without affecting the parent span. This behavior aligns with a "copy-on-write" model.

Any changes made to the current scope after forking MUST NOT impact the forked scope.

The current scope SHOULD be implemented using a context variable, thread-local storage, async-local storage, or an equivalent mechanism appropriate for the platform.

Users MAY fork the current scope explicitly by invoking `sentry.withScope()` or implicitly by starting a new span.

## Applying Scope Data to Events

Data from all three scope types MUST be merged in a specific order before being applied to an event. The process is as follows:

1. data from the global scope is...
2. merged with data from the isolation scope, which is...
3. merged with data from the current scope, which is ...
4. applied to the event
