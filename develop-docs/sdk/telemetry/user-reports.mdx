## Overview

User reports are a deprecated way of submitting user feedback. They associate user information and comments with an existing error event. New implementations **MUST** use the [`feedback` item type](/sdk/telemetry/feedbacks/) instead.

User reports continue to work so older SDKs won't break. If both the item and its associated event are accepted, the backend converts the report into a feedback event.

## Wire Format

### Envelope Item

<SpecSection id="envelope-item" status="deprecated" since="1.0.0">

Item type `"user_report"`. The item contains a JSON payload:

```json
{"event_id":"9ec79c33ec9942ab8353589fcb2e04dc","email":"john@example.com","name":"John Me","comments":"It broke."}
```

#### Payload Attributes

| Field | Type | Required | Since | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `event_id` | String | **REQUIRED** | 1.1.0 | The identifier of the associated event, ideally an error. (since 1.2.0) Updated from "identifier of the event or transaction" to clarify this refers to an associated error event. |
| `email` | String | **RECOMMENDED** | 1.1.0 | The email of the user. |
| `name` | String | **RECOMMENDED** | 1.1.0 | The name of the user. |
| `comments` | String | **RECOMMENDED** | 1.1.0 | Comments of the user about what happened. (since 1.2.0) Max length: **4096 characters**. |

#### Constraints

- This Item **MAY** occur once per Envelope.
- User Reports can be ingested separately from their events. However, SDKs **SHOULD** send them in the same Envelope.
- (since 1.2.0) SDKs **MUST NOT** associate multiple User Reports to the same event.
- (since 1.2.0) The event can not be more than 30 minutes old.
- (since 1.2.0) If the event does not exist in the same project or was never ingested, the report is discarded and never converted to feedback.

#### Envelope Headers

`event_id`

: **UUID String, required.** Corresponds to the `event_id` field of the payload. (since 1.2.0) If the identifier mismatches between the Envelope and payload, the Envelope header takes precedence.

#### Additional Item Headers

_None_

## Public API

### Capture User Feedback (Deprecated)

<SpecSection id="capture-user-feedback" status="deprecated" since="1.1.0">

```
captureUserFeedback(userFeedback) -> void
```

**Parameters:**
- `userFeedback` — Object containing `event_id` (required), and optionally `email`, `name`, `comments`.

(since 1.2.0) SDKs that still expose this function **SHOULD** mark it as deprecated and direct users to [`captureFeedback`](/sdk/telemetry/feedbacks/#capture-feedback) instead.
