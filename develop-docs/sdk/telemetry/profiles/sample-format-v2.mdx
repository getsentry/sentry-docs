The *Sample Format V2* is designed for use in continuous profiling. Therefore, a profile can exist independently and be sent in the envelope on its own.

## Data Model

### Example

```json
{
  "debug_meta": {
    "images": [
      {
        "debug_id": "5819FF25-01CB-3D32-B84F-0634B37D3BBC",
        "image_addr": "0x00000001023a8000",
        "type": "macho",
        "image_size": 16384,

        "stack_id": 0,
        "timestamp": 1724777211.5037799

      }
    ],
    "thread_metadata": {

      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Profile metadata

`debug_meta`

: *Object, required on native platforms.* This carries the same payload as the [`debug_meta` interface](/sdk/data-model/event-payloads/sdk/).
  It is required to have it for native platforms in order to symbolicate, otherwise you can omit it.
  For non-native platforms, you can omit this.

`profiler_id`

: *String, required.* Hexadecimal string representing a uuid4 value. The length must be exactly 32 characters. Dashes and uppercase letters are not allowed. Random UUID for each profiler session.

`chunk_id`

: *String, required.* Hexadecimal string representing a uuid4 value. The length must be exactly 32 characters. Dashes and uppercase letters are not allowed. This is a Random UUID identifying a chunk.

`client_sdk`

: *Object, optional.* Contains information about the client *SDK*.

It can have the following attributes:
- `name`
- `version`

`measurements`

: *Object, optional.* This field contains various metrics measured during the profile collection.

A measurement is a collection of measurement values and a unit for those values.
It will only be shown in the UI if it's been integrated. Right now, we only
support 2 metrics:
- `frozen_frame_renders`: when a frozen frame was detected.
- `slow_frame_renders`: when a slow frame was detected.

A measurement value can contain the following attributes:
- `timestamp`: UNIX timestamp in seconds with microseconds precision as a `float64`.
- `value`: value for the measurement, as a `float64`. We accept `float64`
  formatted as `string` as well.

These are the values accepted for `unit`:
- `nanosecond`
- `ns`
- `hertz`
- `hz`
- `byte`
- `percent`

```json
{
  "cpu_0": {
    "unit": "percent",
    "values": {
      "timestamp": 1724777211.6403089,
      "value": 12.64,
    }
  }
}
```

`platform`

: *String, required.* This value represents the platform the SDK is submitting from.

`release`

: *String, required.* The release version of the application.

**Release versions must be unique across all projects in your organization**.
This value can be the git SHA for the given project, or a product identifier
with a semantic version (suggested format `my-project-name@1.0.0`).

`environment`

: *String, recommended.* The environment name, such as `production` or `staging`. The default value is `production`.

`version`

: *String, required.* Represents the version of the Sample format.

Acceptable values are:
- `"2"`

`profile`

: *Object, required.* It contains all the raw data collected when profiling. See [profile data](#profile-data).


### Profile data

The profile data consists of
- sample, which specifies the start time, their corresponding thread and a stack,
- stacks, which are lists of frames,
- frames, which identify the function and/or line of code for each item in a stacktrace,
- thread metadata, with info about threads.

The selected format is trying to keep the amount of data we transfer to the server as limited as possible.

```json
{
  "profile": {
    "samples": [
      { ... },
      ...
    ],
    "stacks": [
      [ ... ],
      ...
    ],
    "frames": [
      { ... },
      ...
    ],
    "thread_metadata": {
      "259": {
        ...
      }
    }
  }
}
```

When collecting a stack trace, you will:
1. Capture the stack trace.
2. Capture an absolute timestamp of when the stack trace was "captured".
3. Capture the thread ID where this stack trace was captured.
4. Create a list of indices for each frames (add it to the frame list if needed
or use the existing frame's index).
5. Check if that stack exists in the list of stacks and if it doesn't, add it to the list of stacks
6. Create a sample containing the thread ID, the timestamp and the
stack ID.

You should collect samples at a frequency of 101Hz, or roughly once every 10
milliseconds.

`samples`

: *List, required* Contains a list of sample object captured during execution.
Each sample can contain the following attributes:

- `timestamp`: *64-bit floating point, required.* Contains the Unix timestamp in seconds with microseconds precision.
  in seconds with millisecond precision when the sample was captured.
- `stack_id`: *Integer, required.* Contains the stack index from the `stacks` list.
- `thread_id`: *String, required.* Contains the thread ID on which the sample was captured.

```json
    {
        "timestamp": 1724762625.5756555,
        "thread_id": "6154596352",
        "stack_id": 0
    }
```

`stacks`

: *List, required*. Contains a list of frame indices forming a stack trace.

Frames in a stack should be ordered from leaf to root. It means your main frame
should be at the end of the list.

It's encouraged to deduplicate stacks by only storing it once and referring to
the same `stack_id` for each sample that needs it.

`frames`

: *List, required*. Contains a list of frame objects (see [Frame Attributes](/sdk/data-model/event-payloads/stacktrace/#frame-attributes)).

Each object should contain at least a `filename`, `function` or
`instruction_addr` attribute. All values are optional, but recommended.

For native platforms (`cocoa` for example), `instruction_addr` is
required in order to be able to symbolicate and get more info about the frame.

For the rest of the platforms, whatever is passed here will travel to the
frontend and whatever is available can be used to show more or less information.

We will use `module` or `package` (in that order) to group frames when needed.

Some attributes are not used at the moment:
- `raw_function`
- `pre_context`
- `post_context`
- `stack_start`
- `vars`
- `addr_mode`
- `platform`

`thread_metadata`

: *Object, required.* Contains an object with a field for each thread ID detected during runtime.

This object can contain these attributes:
- `name`: name of the thread.
- `priority`: the priority of the thread.

This information will be used on the flamechart to power the thread selector.

```json
{
  "thread_metadata": {
    "259": {
      "name": "com.apple.main-thread",
      "priority": 31
    }
  }
}
```

## Validation

We will reject a chunk (profile) in Relay for several reasons:
- chunk data is missing (no frame, no sample, no stack)
- any of the metadata required is missing
- size of the chunk exceeds 50MB

It is suggested to validate these conditions before sending the chunk.

It's suggested to remove unnecessary data like thread data without samples from
`thread_metadata`.

## Ingestion

After this payload is generated, serialize it as JSON, pack it into an

[Envelope](/sdk/data-model/envelopes/) with the item type [`profile_chunk`](/sdk/data-model/envelope-items/#profile-chunk) and send

it to Relay.

This envelope should look like this:

```json
{"event_id":"a229377b82ad4898be7c3a6272d052d9"}
{"type":"profile_chunk"}
{ /* profile_chunk JSON payload */}
````

## Modifying Transactions Payload

Additional context needs to be attached to the *transactions/spans* payloads for continuous profiling to be connected to tracing.

1. Profile Context:

The profile context for a transaction needs to be updated to contain the profiler id so it can be associated back to the transaction.
The context at `.contexts.profile` should look like:

```json
{
  "profiler_id": "42928c7ee9174231956f077581145489"
}
```

2. Trace Context

The trace context for a transaction needs to be updated to contain the active `thread id` so we know which thread is associated with the transaction. This is often implemented as the thread that the transaction was started in.

The context at `.contexts.trace` should look like:

```json
{
	"data": {
		"thread.id": "thread id",
		"thread.name": "thread name",
	},
	// existing trace context
}
```

`thread.id`

*String, required.* This should be a string that matches the thread id in the *thread_metadata* of the profile chunk.

`thread.name`

*String, optional.* This should be a string that matches the thread name in the *thread_metadata* of the profile chunk.

3. Span Data

Span data needs to be updated in order for a span to contain the active *thread id* so we know which thread is associated with the transaction.
This is often implemented as the thread that the transaction was started in.

The data at `.spans[].data` should look like:

```json
{
  "thread.id": "thread id",
	"thread.name": "thread name",
	"profiler_id": "42928c7ee9174231956f077581145489"
}
```

`thread.id`

*String, required.* This should be a string that matches the thread id in the *thread_metadata* of the profile chunk.

`thread.name`

*String, optional.* This should be a string that matches the thread name in the *thread_metadata* of the profile chunk.

`profiler_id`

*String, optional.* To override the one from the trace context but should not be necessary.
