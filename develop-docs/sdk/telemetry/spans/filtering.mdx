The SDK MUST implement a mechanism for users to filter out spans.
The result MUST be binary (`true` or `false`).
Any APIs exposed to the user to filter spans MUST adhere to the following design principles:

- The APIs are optimized for trace completeness
- The APIs are optimized for conclusive sampling decisions

## Filter with `ignoreSpans`

The `ignoreSpans` option accepts a glob pattern or string.

```js
Sentry.init({
  ignoreSpans: [
    'GET /about',
    'events.signal *',
  ]
})
```

## Filter with `integrations`

The `integrations` option MAY perform in similar fashion as the `ignoreSpans` option, or make explicit opt-out possible via a boolean flag.

```js
Sentry.init({
  integrations: [
    fsIntegration: {
      ignoreSpans: [
        'fs.read',
      ],
      readSpans: true,
      writeSpans: false,
    }
  ]
})
```

## Other approaches

If both options mentioned above are not feasible to be implemented in certain SDKs, other approaches MUST be explored that have the same outcome.
