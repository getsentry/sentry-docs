## Scrubbing data with `beforeSendSpans`

This callback MUST NOT allow the removal of any spans from the span tree.
It receives a deep copy of all spans in the span tree and their attributes.

```
[
  {
    'name': 'GET /',
    'attributes': [
      'http.request.method': 'GET',
      'http.response.status_code': 200,
    ]
  },
]
```

Users MAY mutate any exposed properties to perform sanitation on sensitive data or PII.
The return value of `beforeSendSpans` MUST be merged with the original span tree prior to emission.
