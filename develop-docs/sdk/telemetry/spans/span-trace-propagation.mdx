<Alert level="info">
  This document uses key words such as "MUST", "SHOULD", and "MAY" as defined in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt) to indicate requirement levels.

## Continue an incoming trace

To continue a trace from an upstream service, the SDK must expose a method to extract the traceparent and baggage information and apply these to the applicable scope.

```js
scope.setPropagationContext({
    traceparent: request.headers.SENTRY_TRACE,
    baggage: request.headers.SENTRY_BAGGAGE,
})
```
Newly created root spans should now contain these properties, such as `trace_id` and `parent_span_id`.

## Continue an outgoing trace

To propagate a trace to a downstream service, the SDK must expose methods to fetch the required information to allow the next service to continue the trace.

```js
traceparent = scope.getTraceparent()
baggage = scope.getBaggage()
```
