This document defines the format used by Sentry to ingest replays. This
document is meant for Sentry SDK developers and maintainers of the Session Replay
ingestion pipeline.

A `"replay_event"` Item should always be sent with a `"replay_recording"` Item
in the same envelope.

## `"replay_event"` Item

### Replay Attributes

The following attributes are specific to the `"replay_event"` Item type.

| Key                    | Type                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| type                   | `"replay_event"`          | Must be `"replay_event"`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| replay_id              | string                    | A unique ID for the replay. Follows the [same requirements](/sdk/data-model/event-payloads/#required-attributes) as an `event_id`: Hexadecimal string representing a uuid4 value. The length is exactly 32 characters. Dashes are not allowed. Has to be lowercase.                |
| replay_type            | `"session"` \| `"buffer"` | Describes the type of replay. `buffer` means the replay is buffered while waiting for an error to occur or until a manual flush. `session` means the replay starts recording immediately and continues through the lifespan of the replay session.                                 |
| segment_id             | number                    | The segment id.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| replay_start_timestamp | number                    | UNIX timestamp of the start of the replay (in seconds). This is only required on the first segment.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| urls                   | list[string]              | List of URLs in order of visitation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| trace_ids              | list[string]              | List of trace ids that occurred during the replay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| error_ids              | list[string]              | **DEPRECATED **                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## `"replay_recording"` Item

The `"replay_recording"` item consists of two sub-items that are delimited by newlines. The first is a JSON of the replay recording's metadata. Currently, only `segment_id` is required.

```json
{"segment_id": 0}
```

The other sub-item is the replay recording's instructions set. This payload should be gzipped, but uncompressed payloads are also accepted. Read more about <Link to="/sdk/data-model/event-payloads/replay-recording/">replay recording events here</Link>.

```json
[
  {
    "type": 5,
    "timestamp": 1710861507579,
    "data": {}
  }
]
```

### Example

## SDK Behavior

### Session mode

When an SDK records Session Replay in `session` mode (`sessionSampleRate` is specified), the recording should start when the SDK is initialized and it should be continuously streamed to the Sentry servers. The SDK should send a replay envelope every 5 seconds. The maximum duration of the recording should not exceed 60 minutes (or 15 minutes without an activity on Web).

For the SDKs that support disk cache, the recording should pause when there's no internet connection or the SDK is getting rate-limited. This is necessary to prevent overflowing the disk cache, which can potentially result in losing more critical envelopes. When internet connection is restored or rate limit is lifted, the recording should resume.

### Buffer mode

When an SDK records Session Replay in `buffer` mode (`onErrorSampleRate` is specified), the recording should start when the SDK is initialized and should be buffered in-memory (and to disk if the SDK supports disk cache) in a ring buffer for up to 30 seconds back. The capturing of the recording may be triggered when one of the following conditions is met:

- A crash or error event occurs and is captured by the SDK
- `flush` API has been called manually on the replay (for SDKs that support manual API)

After the initial (buffered) segment has been captured, the SDK should continue recording in `session` mode. Note, however, that the `replay_type` field of the following segments should still be set to `buffer` to reflect the original `replay_type`.

If the crash or error event has been dropped in `beforeSend`, the replay should **not** be captured.
