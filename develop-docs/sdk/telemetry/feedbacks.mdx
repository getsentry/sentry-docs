## Overview

User feedback allows Sentry to collect qualitative input directly from users — free-form comments describing what happened, optionally accompanied by contact information, linked errors, replay recordings, and file attachments. An SDK sends feedback as a `feedback` envelope item containing an event payload with a `feedback` context object.

Related specs:
- [Envelopes](/sdk/foundations/data-model/envelopes/) — transport format
- [Envelope Items](/sdk/foundations/data-model/envelope-items/) — `feedback` item type constraints
- [Event Payloads](/sdk/foundations/data-model/event-payloads/) — base event attributes

## Concepts

### Feedback Events

A **feedback event** is an [event payload](/sdk/foundations/data-model/event-payloads/) with a `feedback` context object. The feedback context carries user-provided data (message, contact info, URLs), while the event payload carries standard attributes (timestamp, event_id, platform, user, tags, etc.).

### Attachments

Files of any type (screenshots, logs, documents) can accompany a feedback event by sending them as [attachment items](/sdk/foundations/data-model/envelope-items/#attachment) in the same envelope. Sentry uses the shared `event_id` to associate attachments with the feedback.

---

## Behavior

### SDK Pipeline

<SpecSection id="feedback-pipeline" status="stable" since="1.0.0">

A feedback captured by `capture_feedback` is processed through the SDK pipeline. The feedback event can be discarded at any stage, at which point no further processing happens.

SDKs **SHOULD** implement a `beforeSendFeedback` callback to allow users to modify or discard the feedback before it is sent. This callback **SHOULD** be similar to the existing [`beforeSend`](/sdk/expected-features/#before-send-hook) callback used for error events. Feedback events **MUST NOT** go through the `beforeSend` hook.

SDKs **MUST** apply scope data to the feedback event, including tags, user, trace, and contexts. The scope's event processors **MUST** also be invoked.

SDKs **MUST** apply [rate limiting](/sdk/expected-features/rate-limiting/) to feedbacks in the same way as it is applied to events.

There is no sample rate for feedbacks — they are always sent. However, a feedback can be discarded at any pipeline stage (rate limiting, invalid message, etc.). SDKs **SHOULD** report dropped feedbacks through [client reports](/sdk/telemetry/client-reports/).

</SpecSection>

### Session Replay Integration

<SpecSection id="session-replay-flush" status="stable" since="1.0.0">

When sending feedback, SDKs **SHOULD** flush the current Session Replay, if running. This ensures a meaningful replay recording exists and can be included in the `replay_id` attribute of the feedback context.

</SpecSection>

### Replay Sampling Timing for Feedback Widgets

<SpecSection id="replay-widget-sampling-timing" status="stable" since="1.1.0">

For feedback widgets specifically, when Session Replay's `onErrorSampleRate` is greater than 0, SDKs **MUST** sample and flush the replay when the widget **opens**, not when the user submits the feedback.

This timing is critical because:

- The replay buffer captures the user's session leading up to opening the feedback widget, providing context about what the user experienced before deciding to provide feedback.
- If sampling only occurs on submission, the buffer would primarily contain the user's interactions with the feedback form itself, which provides minimal debugging value.
- Early sampling ensures the complete user context is preserved regardless of whether the user ultimately submits the feedback.

</SpecSection>

## Wire Format

### Feedback Payload

<SpecSection id="feedback-payload" status="stable" since="1.0.0">

A feedback is sent as a `feedback` envelope item containing a JSON object. The object is an [event payload](/sdk/foundations/data-model/event-payloads/) with an additional `feedback` context object.

#### Event Attributes

Below is a recap of the [required attributes](/sdk/foundations/data-model/event-payloads/#required-attributes) for the event payload. For the full list of attributes, see [Event Payloads](/sdk/foundations/data-model/event-payloads/).

| Field | Type | Required | Since | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `event_id` | String | **REQUIRED** | 1.0.0 | Hexadecimal string representing a UUID v4 value. |
| `timestamp` | Number | **REQUIRED** | 1.0.0 | UNIX timestamp of the current time (in seconds). |
| `platform` | String | **REQUIRED** | 1.0.0 | Platform of the SDK. |

#### Feedback Context Attributes

The `contexts.feedback` object carries user-provided feedback data:

| Field | Type | Required | Since | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `message` | String | **REQUIRED** | 1.0.0 | Comments of the user, describing what happened and/or sharing feedback. Max length: **4096 characters**. |
| `contact_email` | String | **OPTIONAL** | 1.0.0 | Email of the user who submitted the feedback. If excluded, Sentry (not the SDK) attempts to fill this in from user context. Anonymous feedbacks (no name or email) are accepted. |
| `name` | String | **OPTIONAL** | 1.0.0 | Name of the user who submitted the feedback. If excluded, Sentry (not the SDK) attempts to fill this in from user context. |
| `url` | String | **OPTIONAL** | 1.0.0 | URL of the webpage the user was on when submitting feedback. May be used for search or alerts. |
| `associated_event_id` | String | **OPTIONAL** | 1.0.0 | Identifier of an error event in the same project. Links a related error in the feedback UI. |
| `replay_id` | String | **OPTIONAL** | 1.0.0 | Identifier of a related Session Replay in the same project. Sentry uses this to render a Replay clip in the feedback UI. |

</SpecSection>

### File Attachments

<SpecSection id="file-attachments" status="stable" since="1.0.0">

SDKs **MAY** attach files of any type to a feedback (screenshots, logs, documents, etc.) by sending them as [attachment items](/sdk/foundations/data-model/envelope-items/#attachment), with `event_id` corresponding to the feedback item. SDKs **SHOULD** send attachment items in the same envelope as the feedback item. (since 1.2.0) Attachments are not limited to screenshots — any file type is supported.

</SpecSection>

## Public API

### Capture Feedback

<SpecSection id="capture-feedback" status="stable" since="1.0.0">

SDKs **MUST** expose a top-level function to send a feedback:

```
captureFeedback(feedback) -> eventId
```

**Parameters:**
- `feedback` — Object containing at minimum `message`. Optionally includes `contact_email`, `name`, `url`, `associated_event_id`, and `replay_id`.

**Returns:** The `eventId` (string).

Naming **SHOULD** follow the SDK's language conventions:
- `captureFeedback` (JavaScript, Java)
- `capture_feedback` (Python, Ruby)
- `CaptureFeedback` (Go, .NET)

</SpecSection>
