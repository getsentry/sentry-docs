## Overview

Logs allow Sentry to ingest structured log data from SDKs. SDKs send log envelopes containing structured log payloads with severity levels, trace context, and arbitrary attributes. Sentry uses this data to provide searchable, correlated log views alongside errors and traces.

There are two wire protocols: the `log` envelope with the Sentry Log protocol (preferred), and the `otel_log` envelope with the OpenTelemetry Log protocol. All SDKs **MUST** send logs via the `log` envelope and Sentry Log protocol. The `otel_log` format is documented in [Appendix: `otel_log` Format](#otel_log-envelope-item-payload) for completeness.

Related specs:
- [Envelopes](/sdk/foundations/transport/envelopes/) — transport format
- [Attributes](/sdk/foundations/state-management/scopes/attributes) — attribute type system
- [Tracing without Performance](/sdk/foundations/trace-propagation/#default-propagation) — required for trace context
- [Trace Origin](/sdk/telemetry/traces/trace-origin/) — origin attribute format

---

## Concepts

### Structured Logging

Logs support parameterized message templates for structured logging. Instead of interpolating values into the message body directly, SDKs send the template and parameters separately. This enables Sentry to group similar log messages and perform efficient searching.

```
Template:    "User %s has logged in!"
Parameter 0: "John"
Body:        "User John has logged in!"
```

The SDK sends the interpolated `body`, the `sentry.message.template`, and `sentry.message.parameter.X` attributes.

### Severity Levels

Logs use a severity model with six levels (lowest to highest): `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`. These map exactly to [OpenTelemetry's Severity text field](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/logs/data-model/#field-severitytext).

Each level maps to a numeric severity range following the [OpenTelemetry Severity Number](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/logs/data-model/#field-severitynumber) specification:

| SeverityNumber range | Range name | Meaning |
| -------------------- | ---------- | ------- |
| 1-4 | Trace | A fine-grained debugging event. Typically disabled in default configurations. |
| 5-8 | Debug | A debugging event. |
| 9-12 | Info | An informational event. Indicates that an event happened. |
| 13-16 | Warn | A warning event. Not an error but is likely more important than an informational event. |
| 17-20 | Error | An error event. Something went wrong. |
| 21-24 | Fatal | A fatal error such as application or system crash. |

SDKs **SHOULD** set the lowest severity number for a given severity level (e.g., `warn` uses severity number `13`).

### Log Buffering

Logs are buffered before sending. SDKs collect logs into a buffer and flush them as a batch in a single `log` envelope item, rather than sending each log individually. This reduces network overhead and aligns with Relay, which is optimized for up to 100 logs per envelope.

---

## Behavior

<SpecSection id="log-processing-pipeline" status="candidate" since="1.3.0">

### Log Processing Pipeline

Log processing **MUST** follow this order:

1. Capture log via [Public APIs](#logger-module) (e.g. `Sentry.logger.info`) or via [SDK integrations](#sdk-integrations).
2. Check if logging is enabled via `enableLogs`/`enable_logs` — if not, skip remaining steps.
3. Pass the log to Hub/Scope, which **MUST** offer the same methods as the static API `Sentry.logger.X`.
4. Pass the log to the Client via a generic method (e.g., `captureLog(log, scope)`).
5. Process captured log (attach attributes per [Default Attributes](#default-attributes)).
6. Run `beforeSendLog`/`before_send_log` to filter or modify the log.
7. Add log to buffer/batch processor per [Buffering](#buffering).
8. At flush time, send array of logs to Sentry via `log` envelope, applying rate limiting per [Data Category and Rate Limiting](#data-category-and-rate-limiting).

<Alert title="Note" level="warning">

An SDK **SHOULD** implement [Tracing without Performance](/sdk/foundations/trace-propagation/#default-propagation) before adding support for logs. This is required to ensure logs are associated with traces and that the correct trace context is sent to Sentry.

</Alert>

</SpecSection>

<SpecSection id="default-attributes" status="candidate" since="1.0.0">

### Default Attributes

SDKs **MUST** attach the following attributes to every log:

| Attribute | Since | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `sentry.environment` | 1.0.0 | The environment set in the SDK, if defined. |
| `sentry.release` | 1.0.0 | The release set in the SDK, if defined. |
| `sentry.sdk.name` | 1.0.0 | The name of the SDK that sent the log. |
| `sentry.sdk.version` | 1.0.0 | The version of the SDK that sent the log. |
| `sentry.replay_id` | 1.8.0 | The replay ID of the active replay when the log was collected. **MUST NOT** be set if no replay is active. |
| `sentry.timestamp.sequence` | 1.16.0 | A monotonically incrementing integer counter used to determine correct ordering of logs when timestamps are identical. **MUST** be sent on runtimes with frozen or low-precision timers, **MAY** be omitted otherwise. See [Log Ordering](#log-ordering). |

For parameterized logs, SDKs **MUST** also attach:

| Attribute | Since | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `sentry.message.template` | 1.0.0 | The parameterized template string. |
| `sentry.message.parameter.X` | 1.0.0 | Parameters to the template. `X` is either the positional index (`0`, `1`, etc.) or the parameter name (`item_id`, `user_id`, etc.). |

If there are no `sentry.message.parameter.X` attributes, SDKs **MUST NOT** attach `sentry.message.template` (since 1.7.0). This reduces duplicate content and simplifies PII processing.

<Alert>

SDKs **SHOULD** minimize default attributes. Logs are charged per byte size. New default attributes **SHOULD** only be added after significant user feedback and discussion with the SDK and ingest teams.

</Alert>

</SpecSection>

<SpecSection id="sdk-integration-origin" status="candidate" since="1.0.0">

### SDK Integration Origin

If a log is generated by an SDK integration, the SDK **SHOULD** set the `sentry.origin` attribute per the [Trace Origin](/sdk/telemetry/traces/trace-origin/) documentation.

Since 1.9.0, logs follow these rules:

1. **User calls Sentry's Logging API directly:** SDKs **MUST NOT** send `sentry.origin`. This intentionally deviates from the Trace Origin spec to minimize log size.
2. **Captured from a logging library:** Use `auto.log.<name>` format (e.g., `"auto.log.serilog"`).
3. **Auto-emitted from other instrumented systems:** Use `auto.<category>.<integration-name>` format (e.g., `"auto.db.prisma"`).

</SpecSection>

<SpecSection id="user-attributes" status="candidate" since="1.5.0">

### User Attributes

SDKs **MAY** attach user information as attributes, guarded by `sendDefaultPii` (since 1.14.0):

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `user.id` | The user ID. Maps to `id` in the [User](/sdk/foundations/transport/event-payloads/user/) payload. |
| `user.name` | The username. Maps to `username` in the [User](/sdk/foundations/transport/event-payloads/user/) payload. |
| `user.email` | The email address. Maps to `email` in the [User](/sdk/foundations/transport/event-payloads/user/) payload. |

</SpecSection>

<SpecSection id="user-agent-parsing" status="candidate" since="1.5.0">

### User Agent Parsing

By default, Relay parses the user agent attached to an incoming log envelope to extract `browser` and `os` information. SDKs **MAY** attach these attributes if they do not forward a user agent:

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `browser.name` | Display name of the browser. Maps to `name` in [Browser Context](/sdk/foundations/transport/event-payloads/contexts/#browser-context). |
| `browser.version` | Version string of the browser. Maps to `version` in [Browser Context](/sdk/foundations/transport/event-payloads/contexts/#browser-context). |

</SpecSection>

<SpecSection id="backend-attributes" status="candidate" since="1.0.0">

### Backend SDK Attributes

Backend SDKs (Node.js, Python, PHP, etc.) **SHOULD** attach:

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `server.address` | The server address. Equivalent to [`server_name`](/sdk/foundations/transport/event-payloads/#optional-attributes) on errors and transactions. |

</SpecSection>

<SpecSection id="mobile-native-attributes" status="candidate" since="1.5.0">

### Mobile, Desktop, and Native SDK Attributes

Mobile, desktop, and native SDKs (Android, Apple, Electron, etc.) **SHOULD** attach:

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `os.name` | OS name. Maps to `name` in [OS Context](/sdk/foundations/transport/event-payloads/contexts/#os-context). |
| `os.version` | OS version. Maps to `version` in [OS Context](/sdk/foundations/transport/event-payloads/contexts/#os-context). |
| `device.brand` | Device brand. Maps to `brand` in [Device Context](/sdk/foundations/transport/event-payloads/contexts/#device-context). |
| `device.model` | Device model. Maps to `model` in [Device Context](/sdk/foundations/transport/event-payloads/contexts/#device-context). |
| `device.family` | Device family. Maps to `family` in [Device Context](/sdk/foundations/transport/event-payloads/contexts/#device-context). |

</SpecSection>

<SpecSection id="buffering" status="candidate" since="1.0.0">

### Buffering

SDKs **MUST** buffer logs before sending. A simple initial strategy is flushing when the buffer exceeds 100 items or 5 seconds have passed. The buffer **SHOULD** forward logs to the transport in the scenarios outlined in the [telemetry buffer data forwarding scenarios](/sdk/foundations/processing/telemetry-processor/#data-forwarding-scenarios).

SDKs **MUST NOT** send more than 100 logs per envelope (since 1.15.0). Relay is optimized for this limit.

SDKs **MUST** enforce a hard limit of 1000 queued log events to prevent out-of-memory issues (since 1.12.0). Logs added beyond this limit are dropped. SDKs **MAY** use a lower limit but **MUST NOT** exceed 1000.

SDKs **MUST NOT** release logging capabilities to users without a buffering implementation.

</SpecSection>

<SpecSection id="data-category-rate-limiting" status="candidate" since="1.0.0">

### Data Category and Rate Limiting

Logs use the `log_item` data category for rate limiting in Relay. Both `log` and `otel_log` envelopes are covered by this data category. SDKs **MUST** implement this data category. Rate limiting applies as usual with no special behavior for logs.

SDKs **MUST** track client outcomes for this data category to report how often logs are dropped.

</SpecSection>

<SpecSection id="sdk-integrations" status="candidate" since="1.0.0">

### SDK Integrations

SDKs **SHOULD** provide integrations that capture logs from platform logging libraries (e.g., JavaScript's `console`, Python's `logging`, Java's `Log4j`) when `enableLogs`/`enable_logs` is set to `true`.

SDKs **MAY** introduce additional options beyond `enableLogs`/`enable_logs` to gate integration-specific functionality (e.g., controlling log appenders added via external config).

</SpecSection>

<SpecSection id="tracing-association" status="candidate" since="1.0.0">

### Tracing Association

Logs **SHOULD** be associated with traces. If a log is recorded during an active span, SDKs **SHOULD** set the `span_id` property to the active span's ID.

</SpecSection>

<SpecSection id="replay-association" status="candidate" since="1.8.0">

### Replay Association

Logs **SHOULD** be associated with replays. If a log is recorded during an active replay, SDKs **SHOULD** set the `sentry.replay_id` attribute to the active replay's ID.

</SpecSection>

### Log Ordering

<SpecSection id="log-ordering" status="candidate" since="1.16.0">

Some runtimes (notably Cloudflare Workers) freeze timer APIs (`Date.now()`, `performance.now()`) during synchronous execution, causing multiple logs to share identical timestamps. SDKs that target runtimes where timestamps may be frozen or lack sub-millisecond precision **MUST** attach a `sentry.timestamp.sequence` integer attribute to every log. SDKs that only target runtimes with reliable sub-millisecond timestamps **MAY** omit it.

When sent, the sequence integer **MUST**:
- Start at `0` when the SDK initializes.
- Increment by `1` for each log that is captured.
- Reset to `0` when:
  - The SDK is re-initialized.
  - The current log's integer millisecond differs from the previous log's integer millisecond (i.e., `floor(timestamp_seconds * 1000)` changes).

The sequence provides deterministic ordering within a single SDK instance. It does not guarantee ordering across independent processes or workers, which have separate counters. The reset behavior ensures the sequence only increments for consecutive logs that share the same timestamp.

</SpecSection>

### Debug Mode

<SpecSection id="debug-mode" status="candidate" since="1.0.0">

### Debug Mode

If `debug` is set to `true` in SDK init, calls to the Sentry logger API **SHOULD** also print to the console with the appropriate log level. This aids debugging of logging setups.

</SpecSection>

<SpecSection id="client-reports" status="candidate" since="1.13.0">

### Client Reports

SDKs **MUST** report count (`log_item`) and size in bytes (`log_byte`) of discarded log messages. An approximation of log size is sufficient (e.g., by counting as if serialized).

</SpecSection>

## Wire Format

<SpecSection id="log-envelope-item" status="candidate" since="1.1.0">

### `log` Envelope Item

The `log` envelope item contains an array of log payloads encoded as JSON, allowing multiple logs per envelope item.

An envelope **MUST** contain at most one `log` envelope item — all log entries for a flush are batched into a single item's `items` array. Logs from different traces **MAY** be mixed into the same `log` item, but if they are, the envelope **MUST NOT** include a DSC (dynamic sampling context) header.

**Item Headers:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `type` | String | **REQUIRED** | **MUST** be `"log"`. |
| `item_count` | Integer | **REQUIRED** | The number of log entries in the `items` array. **MUST** match the actual count. |

## Public API

<SpecSection id="initialization-options" status="candidate" since="1.0.0">

### Initialization Options

SDKs **MUST** expose the following configuration options:

| Option | Type | Default | Since | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------|-------------|
| `enableLogs` / `enable_logs` | Boolean | `false` | 1.0.0 | Controls whether log envelopes are generated and sent. If `false`, the SDK **MUST NOT** send logs. |
| `beforeSendLog` / `before_send_log` | Function | — | 1.0.0 | **OPTIONAL** callback receiving a log object. Returns a modified log or `null` to drop it. |

While logs functionality is in an experimental state, SDKs **SHOULD** put these options in an experimental namespace:

```js
Sentry.init({
  _experiments: { enableLogs: true },
});
```

</SpecSection>

<SpecSection id="logger-api" status="candidate" since="1.0.0">

### Logger Module

SDKs **MUST** expose logging methods in a `logger` module or namespace, with one method per [severity level](#severity-levels):

- `Sentry.logger.trace`
- `Sentry.logger.debug`
- `Sentry.logger.info`
- `Sentry.logger.warn`
- `Sentry.logger.error`
- `Sentry.logger.fatal`

These methods accept a string template and parameters for structured logging. They **MAY** also accept arbitrary attributes.

The Hub/Scope **MUST** offer the same methods as the static `Sentry.logger.X` API (since 1.10.0). The Client **SHOULD** only offer one generic method (e.g., `captureLog(log, scope)`).

SDKs **MAY** add additional helpers (e.g., decorators, string template helpers) as appropriate for their platform.

</SpecSection>

<SpecSection id="threading-concurrency" status="candidate" since="1.0.0">

### Threading and Concurrency

The `Sentry.logger.X` methods are fire-and-forget (no return value). SDKs **MAY** run these methods on a separate thread or queue them for later processing, including evaluating the string template and running internal hooks like `beforeSendLog`.

SDKs **MUST** ensure logs are sent in the order they are received.

<Alert title="Note" level="warning">

Putting everything on a background thread risks losing logs that occur directly before a crash. Mobile SDKs will need a more robust mechanism. The individual SDK will need to determine the best approach for their platform.

</Alert>

</SpecSection>

## Examples

### SDK API Usage

<Alert>

These examples are illustrative, not normative. SDK authors **SHOULD** ensure the API best fits their platform.

</Alert>

```jsx
// Browser - tagged template literals
Sentry.logger.info(Sentry.logger.fmt`Adding item ${itemId} for user ${userId}`);

// Server-side - printf-like syntax
Sentry.logger.info("Adding item %s for user %s", [itemId, userId], {
  extra: 123,
});
```

```python
Sentry.logger.info('Adding item {item} for user {user}', item=item_id, user=user_id, attributes={ 'extra': 123 });
```

```php
use function Sentry\logger;

logger()->info('Adding item %s for user %s', [$item_id, $user_id], ['extra' => 123]);
```

```java
Sentry.logger().info("Adding item %s for user %s", itemId, userId);
```

```swift
SentrySDK.logger
  .info(message: "Adding item %s for user %s",
    params: [itemId, userId],
    attributes: ["extra": @"123"]
  )
```
