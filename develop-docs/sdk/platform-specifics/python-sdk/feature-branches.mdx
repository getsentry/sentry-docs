Sometimes we have long-running feature branches that can't be merged into `master` yet because they contain breaking changes (e.g. `sentry-sdk-2.0`, `potel-base`). They have to be kept in sync with `master` though.

You might be tempted to branch off the feature branch and do the merge there, maybe make a PR so that you can double check the changes in the UI and make sure CI is green. In that case you need to make sure you **don't actually commit the merge from another branch** â€” the merge commit needs to be directly on the feature branch, otherwise `git` doesn't set the parent commits for the merge commit properly and the feature branch will still have unresolved conflicts (even though you literally just resolved them).

## How to sync so that merge conflicts are recognized as resolved

If you still want the nice GH diff and have CI run on your changes:

- check out the feature branch and `git merge master` into it
- solve conflicts (while still on the feature branch)
- commit the merge (still on the feature branch)
- *(if you're already confident all is good, you can just short circuit and push now, otherwise:)*
- then open a new branch from your feature branch `git checkout -b sync-feature-with-master`
- push the new branch, make a PR, look at the nice diff in GitHub, see if the tests pass
- if everything looks ok: don't merge the PR! this will not mark the merge conflicts as solved
- instead, `git checkout` your feature branch (with the merge commit on top) and `push` it
