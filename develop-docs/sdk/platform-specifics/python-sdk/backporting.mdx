The last normal 1.x release was [1.45.0](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/releases/tag/1.45.0) in April 2024. Development on 1.x has stopped — we are not backporting any features or bugfixes outside of security fixes.

If there is a security issue in the SDK severe enough that it needs a backport to 1.x (see for example [1.45.1](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/releases/tag/1.45.1)):

- Checkout the `1.x` branch
- Port the fix into the `1.x` branch
- Trigger a release. Make sure to set both “Use workflow from” and “Target branch to merge into” to `1.x`
- Continue with the release process as usual
