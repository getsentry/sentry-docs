This Section contains JavaScript SDK-specific information that's useful for developing new or extending existing JS SDKs as well as for ingest and product teams to understanding how the JS SDKs works and what data it sends.

If you're looking to contribute new features to the SDK or want to understand what data you can consume from the JS SDK, this is the right place to start.
The JS SDK team encourages community or cross-team contributions to the SDK and is happy to help you get started.

Please reach out to the SDK team (on [GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript) or internally in Slack `#discuss-javascript`) if you have questions, concerns or plan on building a larger feature.
