title: 'Guidelines for Tracing Support'
---

This document covers how SDKs should add support for [Distributed
Tracing](https://docs.sentry.io/product/performance/distributed-tracing/).

This should give an overview of the APIs that SDKs need to implement, without
mandating internal implementation details.

Reference implementations:

- [`@sentry/tracing`
(JavaScript)](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/tree/master/packages/tracing)
- [Python SDK](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/blob/master/sentry_sdk/tracing.py)

## SDK Configuration

A new option `tracesSampleRate` must be added to `sentry.init`.

The type is a `float` and expected values are in the range `[0.0, 1.0]`.  
The default value is `0.0`.

A `tracesSampleRate` of `0.0` means no transactions should be sent to Sentry.
Conversely, `1.0` means all transactions should be sent.
Anything in between means the fraction of uniformly random samples that should
be sent. For example, `0.25` means send ~25% of all transactions.

The default value being `0.0` is such that tracing is an opt-in feature.

Transactions should be sampled only by `tracesSampleRate`. The `sampleRate`
configuration is used for error events and should not apply to transactions.

Pay special attention only evaluate the sampling decision once for transaction
events from their creation until their delivery to Sentry, and only based on
`tracesSampleRate`.

## `Event` Changes

As of writing, transactions are implemented as an extension of the `Event`
model.

The distinctive feature of a `Transaction` is `type: "transaction"`.

Apart from that, the `Event` gets new fields: `spans`, `contexts.TraceContext`.

## New `Span` and `Transaction` Classes

The [Span](/sdk/event-payloads/span/) class stores each individual span in a
trace.

The [Transaction](/sdk/event-payloads/transaction/) class is like a span, with a
few key differences:

- Transactions have `name`, spans don't.
- Calling the `finish` method on spans record the span's end timestamp. For
  transactions, the `finish` method additionally sends an event to Sentry.

The `Transaction` class may inherit from `Span`, but that's an implementation
detail. Semantically, transactions represent both the top-level span of a span
tree as well as the unit of reporting to Sentry.

- `Span` Interface
    - When a `Span` is created, set the `startTimestamp` to the current time
    - `SpanContext` is the attribute collection for a `Span` (Can be an implementation detail)
    - The relation between parent - child is captured in the property `parentSpanId`
    - `Span` should have a method called `toTraceparent` which returns a string `sentry-trace` that could be sent as a header
    - Similar `SpanContext` should have a static method called `fromTraceparent` which prefills a `SpanContext` with data received from a `sentry-trace` string
- `Transaction` Interface
    - A `Transaction` internally holds a flat list of child Spans (not a tree structure)
    - `Transaction` has additionally a `setName` method the set the name of the transaction
    - `Transaction` receives a `TransactionContext` on creation (new property vs. `SpanContext` is `name`)
    - Since a `Transaction` inherits a `Span` it has all functions available and can be interacted with like it was a `Span`

- `Span.finish()`
    - Just set `endTimestamp` to the current time (in payload `timestamp`)
- `Transaction.finish()`
    - `super.finish()` (call finish on Span)
    - Send it to Sentry only if `sampled == true`
    - A `Transaction` needs to be wrapped in an `Envelope` and sent to the [Envelope Endpoint](/sdk/envelopes/)
    - The `Transport` should use the same internal queue for `Transactions` / `Events`
    - The `Transport` should implement category-based rate limiting →
    - The `Transport` should deal with wrapping a `Transaction` in an `Envelope` internally

## Header `sentry-trace`

`sentry-trace = traceid-spanid-sampling`

With sampling being optional. So at a minimum, it's expected:

`sentry-trace = traceid-spanid`

To offer a minimal compatibility with W3C `traceparent` (without the version prefix) and `b3`  (which considers valid both 64 and 128 bits for `traceId`) headers the propagation header should have a `traceId` of 128 bits encoded in 32 hex chars and a `spanId` of 64 bits encoded in 16 hex chars.
To avoid confusion with W3C `traceparent` due to being similar but not the exactly an implementation of it, we call it simply `sentry-trace`.
No version is being defined in the header.

### Sampling

The sampling section is optional. The format is not `flags` to simplify processing it. It's a single char. The possible values are:

```
  - No value means defer

0 - Don't sample

1 - Sampled
```

Differently than `b3` a simple sampling decision as a value to `sentry-trace` should not be implemented. [There are reasons to always include](https://github.com/apache/incubator-zipkin-b3-propagation/blob/bc937b6854ea30e46b3e85fbf147d8f4de685dd5/README.md#why-send-trace-ids-with-a-reject-sampling-decision) the `trace-id` and `span-id` regardless of sampling having been decided by the caller. And also this will simplify the implementation.
Besides the [usual reasons to use *defer](https://github.com/apache/incubator-zipkin-b3-propagation/blob/bc937b6854ea30e46b3e85fbf147d8f4de685dd5/README.md#why-defer-a-sampling-decision),* in the case of Sentry, a reason would be if a downstream system captures an error event with Sentry. The decision could be done at that point to sample that trace in order to have tracing data available for the reported crash. 

`sentry-trace = sampled`

Which in reality is useful for proxies to set it to `0` and opt out of tracing.

## Static API Changes

The `Sentry.startTransaction` function should take the same arguments as the
`Transaction` constructor.

It creates a `Transaction` bound to the current hub and returns the instance.
Users interact with the instance for creating child spans and, thus, have to
keep track of it themselves.

## `Hub` Changes

- Introduce a method called `traceHeaders`
    - This function returns a header (string) `sentry-trace`
    - The value should be the trace header string of the `Span` that is currently on the `Scope`

- `Hub` → Introduce a method called `startTransaction`
    - Creates a new `Transaction` instance
    - This method deals with sampling, and therefore it should take the `tracesSampleRate` option into account:
        - Depending on the outcome, the sample decision should be stored in the `Transaction`'s `sampled` property and again forwarded to its children

<!--
NOTE: we may omit this as a deprecated API replaced by `startTransaction` and
`transaction.startChild`, or embrace it as a shortcut for creating a span that
is the child of an existing transaction in the current scope or otherwise an
orphan span (that will not be sent to Sentry on its own).

- `Hub` → Introduce a method called `startSpan`
    - Creates a new `Span` instance
    - If there is already a `Span` on the current `Scope`, the created `Span`
      should be its child
-->

## `Scope` Changes

The `Scope` holds a reference to the current `Span` or `Transaction`.

<!--
TODO: as of writing, the reference in the scope is only done for automatically
instrumented transactions and spans. It is yet-to-be-specified whether this
behavior applies to manual instrumentation as well.
-->

- `Scope` Introduce `setSpan`
    - This can be used internally to pass a `Span` / `Transaction` around so
      that integrations can attach children to it
    - Setting the `transaction` property on the `Scope` (legacy) should
      overwrite the name of the `Transaction` stored in the `Scope`, if there is
      one. With that we give users the option to change the transaction name
      even if they don't have access to the instance of the `Transaction`
      directly.

## Interaction with `beforeSend` and Event Processors

The `beforeSend` callback is a special Event Processor that we consider to be of
most prominent use. Proper Event Processors are often considered internal.

Transactions should **not** go through `beforeSend`. However, they are still
processed by Event Processors. This is a compromise between some flexibility in
dealing with the current implementation of transactions as events, and
leaving room for different lifetime hooks for transactions and spans.

Motivations:

1. Future-proofing: if users rely on `beforeSend` for transactions, that would
   complicate eventually implementing individual span ingestion without breaking
   user code. As of writing, a transaction is sent as an event, but that is
   considered an implementation detail.

2. API compatibility: users have their existing implementation of `beforeSend`
   that only ever had to deal with error events. We introduced transactions as a
   new type of event. As users upgrade to a new SDK version and start using
   tracing, their `beforeSend` would start seeing a new type that their code was
   not meant to handle. Before transactions, they didn't have to care about
   different event types at all. There are several possible consequences:
   breaking user apps; silently and unintentionally dropping transactions;
   transaction events modified in surprising ways.

3. In terms of usability, `beforeSend` is not a perfect fit for dropping
   transactions like it is for dropping errors. Errors are a point-in-time
   event. When errors happen, users have full context in `beforeSend` and can
   modify/drop the event before it goes to Sentry. With transactions the flow is
   different. Transactions are created and then they are open for some time
   while child spans are created and appended to it. Meanwhile outgoing HTTP
   requests include the sampling decision of the current transaction with other
   services. After spans and the transaction are finished, dropping the
   transaction in a `beforeSend`-like hook would leave orphan transactions from
   other services in a trace. Similarly, modifying the sampling decision to
   "yes" at this late stage would also produce inconsistent traces.
