title: 'Guideline for AM support'
---

This document covers how unified SDKs should implement AM.
Things listed here are in no specific order, cover the API shape and not how it should be internally implemented.
Read this fully before asking questions.

- New option for the SDK `tracesSampleRate`
    - Defaults to `0.0`, which means send no transactions (0% delivery rate)
    - `1.0` (100% delivery rate) means send all transactions
    - Value is expressed in `0.0` - `1.0` float, ranged from 0% to 100% rate
    - Default makes AM an opt-in feature
    - Transactions should be sampled only by `tracesSampleRate`.
      The `sampleRate` configuration is used for error events and should not
      apply to transactions. Pay special attention not to incur in evaluating
      the sampling decision twice for transaction events from their creation
      until their delivery to Sentry.
- Introduce `Sentry.startTransaction`
    - Internally this creates a `Transaction` and returns the instance
    - Users need to interact with the instance and keep track of it themselves
    - Internally we can use the `Scope` to hold on to a reference of the current `Transaction` if needed
- Introduce the new type [Span](/sdk/event-payloads/span/)
- Introduce new type [Transaction](/sdk/event-payloads/transaction/) which inherits from `Span`
- `Span` Interface
    - When a `Span` is created, set the `startTimestamp` to the current time
    - `SpanContext` is the attribute collection for a `Span` (Can be an implementation detail)
    - The relation between parent - child is captured in the property `parentSpanId`
- `Transaction` Interface
    - A `Transaction` internally holds a flat list of child Spans (not a tree structure)
    - `Transaction` has additionally a `setName` method the set the name of the transaction
    - `Transaction` receives a `TransactionContext` on creation (new property vs. `SpanContext` is `name`)
    - Since a `Transaction` inherits a `Span` it has all functions available and can be interacted with like it was a `Span`
- `Hub` → Introduce a method called `startTransaction`
    - Creates a new `Transaction` instance
    - This method deals with sampling, and therefore it should take the `tracesSampleRate` option into account:
        - Depending on the outcome, the sample decision should be stored in the `Transaction`'s `sampled` property and again forwarded to its children
- `Hub` → Introduce a method called `startSpan`
    - Creates a new `Span` instance
    - If there is already a `Span` on the current `Scope`, the created `Span` should be its child
- `Hub` → Introduce a method called `traceHeaders`
    - This function returns a header (string) `sentry-trace`
    - The value should be the trace header string of the `Span` that is currently on the `Scope`
- `Scope` Introduce `setSpan`
    - This can be used internally to pass a `Span` / `Transaction` around so that integrations can attach children to it
    - Setting the `transaction` property on the `Scope` (legacy) should overwrite the name of the `Transaction` stored in the `Scope`, if there is one. With that we give users the option to change the transaction name even if they don't have access to the instance of the `Transaction` directly.
- `Span.finish()`
    - Just set `endTimestamp` to the current time (in payload `timestamp`)
- `Transaction.finish()`
    - `super.finish()` (call finish on Span)
    - Send it to Sentry only if `sampled == true`
    - A `Transaction` needs to be wrapped in an `Envelope` and sent to the [Envelope Endpoint](/sdk/envelopes/)
    - The `Transport` should use the same internal queue for `Transactions` / `Events`
    - The `Transport` should implement category-based rate limiting →
    - The `Transport` should deal with wrapping a `Transaction` in an `Envelope` internally
- A `Transaction` should **not** go through `beforeSend` (but `EventProcessors` are fine for now, since they are considered internal)
    - The distinctive feature of a `Transaction` is `type: "transaction"`
    - **Motivation**: If we ever want to move to individual Span ingestion, we can't users rely on using this for Transaction.
