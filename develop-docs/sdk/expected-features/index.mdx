</Alert>

## Background Sending

Events should be transmitted in a background thread or similar system.  This queue must be flushed when the
application shuts down with a specific timeout.  This feature is typically user facing and explained
as part of [shutdown and draining](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/draining/).


## Uncaught Exception Handler

Ability for the SDK to be set as a hook to record any uncaught exceptions. At the language level this is typically a global hook provided by the language itself. For framework integrations this might be part of middleware or some other system.

This behavior is typically provided by a default integration that can be disabled.

## Scopes

Scopes should be provided by SDKs to set common attributes and context data on events sent to Sentry emitted from the current scope. They should be inherited to lower scopes so that they can be set "globally" on startup.  Note that some attributes can only be set in the client options (`release`, `environment`) and not on scopes.

What scope means depends on the application, for a web framework it is most likely a single request/response cycle. For a mobile application there is often just one single scope that represents the single user and their actions. Scoping can be difficult to implement because it often has to deal with threads or concurrency and can involve deep integration with frameworks. <Link to="/sdk/foundations/state-management/scopes/">see the Scopes spec</Link> for more information.

## Automatic Context Data

Automatic addition of useful attributes such as `flags` or `tags` or `extra` or specific `contexts`. Typically means the SDK hooks into a framework so that it can set attributes that are known to be useful for most users. Please check [Data Handling](/sdk/expected-features/data-handling) for considerations.

## Breadcrumbs

Manually record application events (into the current scope) during the
lifecycle of an application. Implement a ring buffer so as not to grow
indefinitely. The most recent breadcrumbs should be attached to events as they occur.

With deeper framework integration, the automatic recording of breadcrumbs is possible and recommended, for example:

* UI Events: button clicks, touch events, etc.
* System Events: low battery, low storage space, airplane mode started, memory warnings, device orientation changed, etc.
* [Outgoing HTTP requests](/sdk/foundations/client/integrations/http-client)

Check out the [complete breadcrumb documentation](/sdk/foundations/transport/event-payloads/breadcrumbs/#breadcrumb-types) for more types.

## Rate Limiting

Respect Sentry's HTTP 429 `Retry-After` header, or, if the SDK supports multiple payload types (e.g. errors and transactions), the `X-Sentry-Rate-Limits` header. Outgoing SDK requests should be dropped during the backoff period.

See <Link to="/sdk/expected-features/rate-limiting">Rate Limiting</Link> for details.


## Backpressure Management

Backend SDKs (typically used in server applications) should have backpressure management logic that dynamically downsamples transactions when the throughput in the system is too high.

See <Link to="/sdk/telemetry/traces/backpressure/">Backpressure Management</Link> for details.

## In-App frames

Stack parsing can tell which frames should be identified as part of the user's application (as opposed to part of the language, a library, or a framework), either automatically or by user configuration at startup, often declared as a package/module prefix.

## Surrounding Source in Stack Trace

Lines of source code to provide context in stack traces. This is easier in interpreted languages, may be hard or impossible in compiled ones.

## Local Variables

Local variable names and values for each stack frame, where possible. Restrictions apply on some platforms, for example it may only be possible to collect the values of parameters passed into each function, or it may be completely impossible to collect this information at all.

This functionality should be gated behind the `includeLocalVariables` option, which is `true` by default.

## Desymbolication

Turn compiled or obfuscated code/method names in stack traces back into the original. Desymbolication always requires Sentry backend support. Not necessary for many languages.

## Retrieve Last Event ID

Ability to get the ID of the last event sent. Event IDs are useful for correlation, logging, customers rolling their own feedback forms, etc.

## Attachments

Attachments are files stored alongside an event. To send an attachment, add it as an [envelope item](/sdk/foundations/transport/envelope-items/#attachment)
to the corresponding event.

We recommend implementing two types of attachments, one with a path and another with a byte array.
If the programming language allows it, create one class with multiple constructors to keep things simple and guess the content type
of the attachment via the filename.

The overload that takes a `path` should consider:
* The SDK should read the file when an event gets captured and not when the user adds an attachment to the scope.
* If reading the attachment fails, the SDK should not drop the whole envelope, but just the attachment's envelope item.
* If the SDK is in debug mode log (`debug=true`) out errors to make debugging easier.

If the SDK supports [transactions](/sdk/foundations/transport/envelope-items/#transaction), the attachments should offer a flag `addToTransactions`,
that specifies if SDK adds the attachment to every transaction or not. The default should be `false`.

Use the implementations of [Java](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/blob/main/sentry/src/main/java/io/sentry/Attachment.java),
[Objective-C](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/blob/master/Sources/Sentry/SentryAttachment.m), or
[Python](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/blob/master/sentry_sdk/attachments.py) as a reference for the API.


### Max Attachment Size
Alongside the implementation of attachments, add `maxAttachmentSize` to the options and set the default to 20 MiB. When converting an attachment to an
envelope item, the SDK must discard items larger than the `maxAttachmentSize`. Especially on SDKs with offline caching, typical on mobile, this is
useful because attachments could quickly eat up the users' disk space. Furthermore, Relay has a
[maximum size for attachments](https://docs.sentry.io/product/relay/options/), and we want to reduce unnecessary requests.

## Screenshots

When the user opts-in, if technically possible, take a screenshot of the application during a crash or error and include it as an [attachment](#attachments) to the [envelope](/sdk/foundations/transport/envelopes/) with the event.

This feature only applies to SDKs with a user interface, such as Mobile and Desktop.
In some environments such as native iOS, taking a screenshot requires the UI thread and in the event of a crash, that might not be available. So inherently this feature will be a best effort solution.
Also, some environments don't allow access to the UI or some features during a hard crash, iOS, for example, doesn't allow running Objective-C code after a signal break, therefore no hard crash screenshot capture will be possible.
It's advised to provide this feature through a single option called `attachScreenshot`. That's the preferred way but in platforms such as Flutter, a wrapping widget is required so documentation can point users to that instead of the suggested option name.

The feature is achieved by adding an attachment with:

* The file name should contain the word `screenshot`
* Image size, if possible should stay below 2 MB but quality/size could be configurable
* `ContentType: image/jpg` or `ContentType: image/png`

Whenever possible, avoid adding the attachment altogether if taking the screenshot fails. Alternatively, when streaming, it's possible the envelope header was already flushed through before the attempt to take the screenshot happens. In this case, a 0 byte attachment will be included. In that case, Sentry will not show a screenshot preview.

## List Loaded Libraries

Include a list of loaded libraries (and versions) when sending an event.

## Buffer to Disk

This feature is also known as 'Offline Caching'.

Write events to disk before attempting to send, so that they can be retried in the event of a temporary network failure. Needs to implement a cap on the number of stored events. This is mostly useful on mobile and desktop(e.g: laptop) apps, where stable connectivity is often not available.

### Dealing With Network Failures

When SDKs receive an `HTTP 2xx` status code response from Sentry, they **MUST** consider it as a successful send.

If Sentry returns an `HTTP 4xx` or `HTTP 5xx` status code, SDKs **MUST** discard the envelope and record a [client report](/sdk/telemetry/client-reports/#network-failure-recording) as specified in the client reports spec.

For an [`HTTP 413 Content Too Large`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/413) response, SDKs:

* **MUST** discard the envelope and record a [client report](/sdk/telemetry/client-reports/#network-failure-recording).
* **MUST NOT** retry sending the envelope.
* **SHOULD** log an error, informing users that the envelope was discarded due to size limits.
* **MAY** add information from the response body to the logged error. If doing so, SDKs **MUST** be aware that Relay can change or remove information in the response body for an `HTTP 413` at any time without notice.

For an [`HTTP 429 Too Many Requests`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429) response, SDKs:

- **MUST** respect the [rate limiting rules](/sdk/expected-features/rate-limiting/), such as correctly parsing the retry-header.
- **MUST** discard the envelope, but **MUST NOT** record a [client report](/sdk/telemetry/client-reports/#network-failure-recording), because the upstream already does this.
- **MUST NOT** retry sending the envelope.

SDKs **MAY** retry sending the envelope when a network error occurs, such as:

* Connection timeout
* DSN resolution failure
* Connection reset by peer

When other failures occur, like those caused by processing the file in the SDK itself, SDKs **MUST** discard the envelope and record a [client report](/sdk/telemetry/client-reports/#network-failure-recording) with the discard reason `internal_sdk_error`. Otherwise, the SDK might end up in an endless retry loop.

See the [Client Reports — Network Failure Recording](/sdk/telemetry/client-reports/#network-failure-recording) spec for the full set of client report recording requirements for each HTTP status code.


#### Additional capabilities

Consider having the SDK retry sending events once the device is back online, when such notification exists in the platform.

Once the device is back online, the SDK is likely going to empty its disk queue in a quick burst of requests. This can trigger different abuse filters in Sentry. To account for that, it's considered to add a small delay between cached event captures. A recommended value is 100 milliseconds.

If the SDK is being [rate-limited](/sdk/expected-features/rate-limiting/), which causes the SDK to drop any event that reaches its HTTP transport, consider stop consuming the disk cache until the `Retry-After` timeout is reached or the app restarts.

## Start-Up Crash Detection

We recommend implementing this feature for mobile and desktop SDKs.

If the application crashes shortly after the init of the SDK, the SDK should provide a mechanism to guarantee transmission
to Sentry. Ideally, SDKs could send the events in a separate process not impacted by the crashing application. With the
limitations on mobile platforms, spawning an extra process only for sending envelopes is hard to achieve or impossible.
The SDKs on these platforms send envelopes on a background thread to not block the UI thread or because they forbid network
operations on the UI thread. A crash occurring shortly after the SDK init could lead to never reporting such crashes,
keeping the users unaware of a critical bug.

When the app crashes, the SDK needs to check if it happens within two seconds after the SDK init. If it does, it needs to store
that information on the disk. We recommend using a marker file, which the SDK checks on initialization. Suppose the SDK
allows storing this information in another place to avoid creating an additional marker file and causing extra IO. In that
case, the recommendation is to use such an approach to prevent additional IO. We accept the tradeoff of extra IO to be able
to detect start-up crashes.

If the platform allows it, the SDK may call flush directly after the detected start-up crash occurs and before the
application terminates. If the SDK can guarantee transmission to Sentry while crashing, it can skip creating a marker file
and making a blocking flush call on the next initialization.

If the marker file exists upon the next SDK initialization, the SDK should clear the marker and block the `init` execution up
to five seconds, in order to flush out pending envelopes. If the timeout of five seconds is exceeded, the SDK should release
the `init` lock and continue flushing on a background thread.

While, ideally, the SDK should only flush out the crash event envelope, it is acceptable to call flush for all envelopes to
reduce the complexity, as most of the time, there shouldn't be too many envelopes in the offline cache.

We decided against making this feature configurable. The only reason to disable it should be if the feature is broken; hence
users can't disable it. The users can't modify the duration for detecting the start-up crashes, which is two seconds, and the
flush duration, which is five seconds, because users usually don't know which values to pick so that we can choose the proper
ones. We can always add these values later.

#### Example implementations
- [Java](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/pull/2277)
- [Objective-C](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/pull/2220)

## HTTP Proxy

Ability to use an HTTP proxy. Often easy to implement using the existing HTTP client.  This should be picked up from the system config if possible or explicit config in the client options.

## Attaching Request Body in Server SDKs

Ability for the SDK to attach request body to events and triggered during the execution of request.

User should be able to set a configuration option `maxRequestBodySize` to instruct SDK how big requests bodies should be attached.
SDK controls what is an actual size in bytes for each option:

- `none`
- `small` - `1000` bytes
- `medium` - `10000` bytes (default)
- `always`

## Log context

Some logging frameworks provide an option to set logging context. In Java this is called MDC (Mapped Diagnostic Context).

Users should be able to set a list of logging context entries in a configuration option `contextTags` to tell the SDK to convert the entries to Sentry tags.
