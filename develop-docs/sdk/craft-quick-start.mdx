title: "Craft Quick Start"
---

This guide goes over the minimal setup needed to publish something via
[`publish`] and [`craft`]. This example will use a PyPI package.

[`craft`]: https://github.com/getsentry/craft

## The First Release

This guide assumes this thing has never been released before and has no
existing tags. If that's not the case feel free to skip this section!

A tag must exist for the "beginning" of the repository due to [a limitation] --
it is recommended to tag the first commit of the repository before any
meaningful history such that the first changelog includes useful context.

```bash
git tag 0.0.0 "$(git log -1 --reverse --format=%h)"
git push origin --tags
```

## CI Requirements

First we need to ensure your repository responds to `release/**` branches
and produces an artifact with the right name.

For our example repository that's done using [`push: branches`] and an
[artifact instruction].

[`push: branches`]: https://github.com/getsentry/uwsgi-dogstatsd-plugin/blob/5057cba0104827c226094f153ffba7ade1a4331d/.github/workflows/build.yml#L5
[artifact instruction]: https://github.com/getsentry/uwsgi-dogstatsd-plugin/blob/5057cba0104827c226094f153ffba7ade1a4331d/.github/workflows/build.yml#L81-L84

## Setting Up Craft

### `.craft.yml`

We're just interested in making a GitHub release and a PyPI release so our
`craft` configuration looks like:

```yaml
minVersion: 0.28.1
targets:
- name: pypi
- name: github
```

### `scripts/bump-version.sh`

This script will be invoked by `craft` by default when bumping the version.

Since we're specifying version in `setup.cfg` this is pretty easy to do with
`sed` (we're ignoring `$1` which contains the old version):

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euxo pipefail

sed -i "s/^version =.*/version = $2/" setup.cfg
```

Try the script out (but don't commit the changes):

```console
$ ./scripts/bump-version.sh 0.0.0 1.0.0
+ sed -i 's/^version =.*/version = 1.0.0/' setup.cfg
$ git diff | grep '^[-+]'
--- a/setup.cfg
+++ b/setup.cfg
-version = 0.0.0
+version = 1.0.0
$ git checkout -- .
```

Nice!

### `.github/workflows/release.yml`

This file is used to trigger the release from the GitHub UI.

You'll notice it uses `secrets.GH_RELEASE_PAT` -- this should already be
available to your repository automatically!

```yaml
name: Release

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      version:
        description: Version to release
        required: true
      force:
        description: Force a release even when there are release-blockers (optional)
        required: false

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: "Release a new version"
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GH_RELEASE_PAT }}
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: Prepare release
        uses: getsentry/action-prepare-release@v1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_RELEASE_PAT }}
        with:
          version: ${{ github.event.inputs.version }}
          force: ${{ github.event.inputs.force }}
```

### Commit + PR

**Commit those three files and make a pull request.**

Here's [an example PR] and the [follow-up to fix `fetch-depth`].

## Setting Up Permissions

Give the following teams access to your repository:

- `engineering` -> `write`
- `release-bot` -> `elevated bot`

You can do this self-service via the settings page of your repository:
`https://github.com/getsentry/REPONAME_HERE/settings/access`

## Making Your First Release!

Navigate to the actions tab of your repository, locate the release workflow,
and create the first release! I used `1.0.0` as the first version.

This will create an [issue in `publish`] which you'll need an approver to
add a label to.

## [Optional] Using Multiple Craft Configs in a Repo

In some cases, we need to maintain multiple or diverging publishing configs in a repository.
For example, when we have to maintain multiple major versions of a package we release (e.g. Sentry JavaScript SDK v7 and v8), where we added or removed artifacts or publishing targets.

By default, our publishing process is configured to take the `craft.yml` config from the repo's default branch as the single source of truth for publishing.

You can opt your repo into using the config from a specific merge target branch (can be configured when triggering the Prepare Release Action) in two steps:

### 1. Release Preparation:

Add `craft_config_from_merge_target: true` when calling `getsentry/action-prepare-release` in your repo's release workflow:

```yml
# ...
jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: 'Release a new version'
    steps:
      # ...
      - name: Prepare release
        uses: getsentry/action-prepare-release@v1
        with:
          # ...
          craft_config_from_merge_target: true
```

### 2. Publish Configuration

Add the branch(es) you want to take the config from to the `publish.yml` workflow in `getsentry/publish`:

```yml
# ...
- name: Set target repo checkout branch
  if: |
    fromJSON(steps.inputs.outputs.result).repo == 'sentry-javascript' && fromJSON(steps.inputs.outputs.result).merge_target == 'v7'
```

Note: The branch(es) registered in this step **MUST BE** protected in the target repository.
Disable direct pushing to the branch and require approvals for PRs before they can be merged.

Good job! Now you can let your craft configs diverge across the different merge target branches and the publishing process will pick up the correct config based on the branch you're setting as a merge target.
