title: "craft Quick Start"
---

this guide goes over the minimal setup needed to publish something via
[publish] and [craft].  this example will use a pypi package.

[publish]: https://github.com/getsentry/publish
[craft]: https://github.com/getsentry/craft

## the first release

this guide assumes this thing has never been released before and has no
existing tags.  if that's not the case feel free to skip this section!

a tag must exist for the "beginning" of the repository due to [a limitation] --
it is recommended to tag the first commit of the repository before any
meaningful history such that the first changelog includes useful context.

```bash
git tag 0.0.0 "$(git log -1 --reverse --format=%h)"
git push origin --tags
```

[a limitation]: https://github.com/getsentry/craft/issues/342

## ci requirements

first we need to ensure your repository responds to `release/**` branches
and produces an artifact with the right name

for our example repository that's done using [push: branches] and an
[artifact instruction]

[push: branches]: https://github.com/getsentry/uwsgi-dogstatsd-plugin/blob/5057cba0104827c226094f153ffba7ade1a4331d/.github/workflows/build.yml#L5
[artifact instruction]: https://github.com/getsentry/uwsgi-dogstatsd-plugin/blob/5057cba0104827c226094f153ffba7ade1a4331d/.github/workflows/build.yml#L81-L84

## setting up craft

### .craft.yml

we're just interested in making a github release and a pypi release so our
craft configuration looks like:

```yaml
minVersion: 0.28.1
targets:
- name: pypi
- name: github
```

### scripts/bump-version.sh

this script will be invoked by craft by default when bumping the version

since we're specifying version in `setup.cfg` this is pretty easy to do with
sed (we're ignoring `$1` which contains the old version):

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euxo pipefail

sed -i "s/^version =.*/version = $2/" setup.cfg
```

try the script out (but don't commit the changes):

```console
$ ./scripts/bump-version.sh 0.0.0 1.0.0
+ sed -i 's/^version =.*/version = 1.0.0/' setup.cfg
$ git diff | grep '^[-+]'
--- a/setup.cfg
+++ b/setup.cfg
-version = 0.0.0
+version = 1.0.0
$ git checkout -- .
```

nice !

### .github/workflows/release.yml

this file is used to trigger the release from the github ui

you'll notice it uses `secrets.GH_RELEASE_PAT` -- this should already be
available to your repository automatically!

```yaml
name: Release

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      version:
        description: Version to release
        required: true
      force:
        description: Force a release even when there are release-blockers (optional)
        required: false

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: "Release a new version"
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GH_RELEASE_PAT }}
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: Prepare release
        uses: getsentry/action-prepare-release@v1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_RELEASE_PAT }}
        with:
          version: ${{ github.event.inputs.version }}
          force: ${{ github.event.inputs.force }}
```

### commit + PR

**commit those three files and make a pull request**

here's [an example PR] and the [followup to fix fetch-depth]

[an example PR]: https://github.com/getsentry/uwsgi-dogstatsd-plugin/pull/2
[followup to fix fetch-depth]: https://github.com/getsentry/uwsgi-dogstatsd-plugin/pull/3

## setting up permissions

give the following teams access to your repository:

- `engineering` -> `write`
- `release-bot` -> `admin`

you can do this self-service via the settings page of your repository:
`https://github.com/getsentry/REPONAME_HERE/settings/access`

## making your first release!

navigate to the actions tab of your repository, locate the release workflow,
and create the first release!  I used `1.0.0` as the first version.

this will create an [issue in publish] which you'll need an approver to
add a label to

[issue in publish]: https://github.com/getsentry/publish/issues
