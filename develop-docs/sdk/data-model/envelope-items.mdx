title: Envelope Items
sidebar_order: 2
---

Each Envelope consists of headers and a potentially empty list of Items, each
with their own headers. Which Headers are required depends on the Items in an
Envelope. This section describes all Item types and their respective required
headers. It is worth noting that the list of Item types doesn't match the data
categories used for [rate limiting](/sdk/expected-features/rate-limiting/#definitions) and
client reports.

The type of an Item is declared in the `type` header, as well as the payload
size in `length`. See Serialization Format for a list of common Item headers.
The headers described in this section are **in addition to the common headers**.

### Event

Item type `"event"`. This Item contains an error or default event payload
encoded in JSON.

**Constraints:**

- This Item may occur at most once per Envelope.
- This Item is mutually exclusive with `"transaction"` Items.

**Envelope Headers:**

`event_id`

: **UUID String, required.** Corresponds to the `event_id` field of the event
  payload. Clients are required to generate an event identifier ahead of time
  and set it at least in the Envelope headers. If the identifier mismatches
  between the Envelope and payload, the Envelope header takes precedence.

**Additional Item Headers:**

*None*

### Transaction

Item type `"transaction"`. This Item contains a transaction payload encoded
in JSON.

**Constraints:**

- This Item may occur at most once per Envelope.
- This Item is mutually exclusive with `"event"` Items.

**Envelope Headers:**

`event_id`

: **UUID String, required.** Corresponds to the `event_id` field of the
  transaction payload. Clients are required to generate an event identifier
  ahead of time and set it at least in the Envelope headers. If the identifier
  mismatches between the Envelope and payload, the Envelope header takes
  precedence.

**Additional Item Headers:**

*None*

### Attachment

Item type `"attachment"`. This Item contains a raw payload of an attachment
file. It is always associated to an event or transaction.

**Constraints:**

- This Item may occur multiple times per Envelope.
- For **minidump** and **apple crash report** attachments, the corresponding
  `"event"` Item must be sent within the same Envelope.
- Generic attachments can be ingested separately from their events. We recommend
  sending them in the same Envelope, which allows for more efficient rate
  limiting and filtering.
- Generic attachments sent in separate Envelopes can be dropped independently of
  an event. To ensure consistent handling, consider sending them in the same
  request.
- The Sentry server supports special attachments to ingest event payloads for
  backwards compatibility. These are not part of the official public API and the
  behavior should not be relied upon.

**Envelope Headers:**

`event_id`

: **UUID String, required.** The identifier of the event or transaction.

**Additional Item Headers:**

`filename`

: **String, required.**  The name of the uploaded file without a path component.

`attachment_type`

: *String, optional.* The special type of this attachment. Possible values are:

  - **`event.attachment` (default)**: A standard attachment without special
    meaning.
  - `event.minidump`: A minidump file that creates an error event and is
    symbolicated. The file should start with the `MDMP` magic bytes.
  - `event.applecrashreport`: An Apple crash report file that creates an error
    event and is symbolicated.
  - `unreal.context`: An XML file containing UE4 crash meta data. During event
    ingestion, event contexts and extra fields are extracted from this file.
  - `unreal.logs`: A plain-text log file obtained from UE4 crashes. During
    event ingestion, the last logs are extracted into event breadcrumbs.
  - `event.view_hierarchy`: An JSON file with a predefined structure, see [RFC #33](https://github.com/getsentry/rfcs/blob/main/text/0033-view-hierarchy.md).

`content_type`

: *String, optional.* The content type of the attachment payload. Any [MIME type](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml) may be used; the default is `application/octet-stream`.

### Session

Item type `"session"` contains a single session initialization or update to an
existing session for Release Health.

See the <Link to="/sdk/telemetry/sessions/">sessions</Link> documentation for the payload
details.

**Constraints:**

- This Item may occur multiple times per Envelope.
- Ingestion may limit the maximum number of Items per Envelope, see *Ingestion*.

**Additional Item Headers:**

*None*

### Sessions

Item type `"sessions"` contains buckets of pre-aggregated session counts.

See the <Link to="/sdk/telemetry/sessions/">sessions</Link> documentation for the payload
details.

**Constraints:**

- This Item may occur multiple times per Envelope.
- Ingestion may limit the maximum number of Items per Envelope, see *Ingestion*.

**Additional Item Headers:**

*None*

### Statsd

Item type `"statsd"` contains metrics emissions in a superset of the statsd format.

See the <Link to="/sdk/metrics/">metrics</Link> documentation for the payload
details.

**Constraints:**

- This Item may occur multiple times per Envelope.

**Additional Item Headers:**

*None*

### Metric Meta

Item type `"metric_meta"` contains per-metric meta data which is persisted alongside
metrics in the system.

See the <Link to="/sdk/metrics/">metrics</Link> documentation for the payload
details.

**Constraints:**

- This Item may occur multiple times per Envelope.
- Ingestion may limit the maximum number of Items per Envelope, see *Ingestion*.

**Additional Item Headers:**

*None*

### User Feedback

User Feedback was called User Report in the beginning. Therefore the envelope item type is `"user_report"`.
The item contains a user feedback / user report JSON payload:
```json
{"event_id":"9ec79c33ec9942ab8353589fcb2e04dc","email":"john@me.com","name":"John Me","comments":"It broke."}\n
```

`email`

: *String, recommended.* The email of the user.

`name`

: *String, recommended.* The name of the user.

`comments`

: *String, recommended.* Comments of the user about what happened.

**Constraints:**

- This Item may occur once per Envelope.

  send them in the same Envelope.

`event_id`

: **UUID String, required.** The identifier of the event or transaction.

**Additional Item Headers:**

*None*

### Client Report

Item type `"client_report"` contains a client report payload encoded in JSON.

See the <Link to="/sdk/telemetry/client-reports/">client reports</Link> documentation for the payload
