title: Envelope Items
sidebar_order: 2
---

Each Envelope consists of headers and a potentially empty list of Items, each
with their own headers. Which Headers are required depends on the Items in an
Envelope. This section describes all Item types and their respective required
headers. It is worth noting that the list of Item types doesn't match the data
categories used for [rate limiting](/sdk/expected-features/rate-limiting/#definitions) and
client reports.

The type of an Item is declared in the `type` header, as well as the payload
size in `length`. See Serialization Format for a list of common Item headers.
The headers described in this section are **in addition to the common headers**.

### Event

Item type `"event"`. This Item contains an error or default [event payload](/sdk/data-model/event-payloads/)
encoded in JSON.

**Constraints:**

- This Item may occur at most once per Envelope.
- This Item is mutually exclusive with `"transaction"` Items.

**Envelope Headers:**

`event_id`

: **UUID String, required.** Corresponds to the `event_id` field of the event
payload. Clients are required to generate an event identifier ahead of time
and set it at least in the Envelope headers. If the identifier mismatches
between the Envelope and payload, the Envelope header takes precedence.

**Additional Item Headers:**

_None_

### Transaction

Item type `"transaction"`. This Item contains a transaction payload encoded
in JSON.

**Constraints:**

- This Item may occur at most once per Envelope.
- This Item is mutually exclusive with `"event"` Items.

**Envelope Headers:**

`event_id`

: **UUID String, required.** Corresponds to the `event_id` field of the
transaction payload. Clients are required to generate an event identifier
ahead of time and set it at least in the Envelope headers. If the identifier
mismatches between the Envelope and payload, the Envelope header takes
precedence.

**Additional Item Headers:**

_None_

### Attachment

Item type `"attachment"`. This Item contains a raw payload of an attachment
file. It is always associated to an event or transaction.

**Constraints:**

- This Item may occur multiple times per Envelope.
- For **minidump** and **apple crash report** attachments, the corresponding
  `"event"` Item must be sent within the same Envelope.
- Generic attachments can be ingested separately from their events. We recommend
  sending them in the same Envelope, which allows for more efficient rate
  limiting and filtering.
- Generic attachments sent in separate Envelopes can be dropped independently of
  an event. To ensure consistent handling, consider sending them in the same
  request.
- The Sentry server supports special attachments to ingest event payloads for
  backwards compatibility. These are not part of the official public API and the
  behavior should not be relied upon.

**Envelope Headers:**

`event_id`

: **UUID String, required.** The identifier of the event or transaction.

**Additional Item Headers:**

`filename`

: **String, required.** The name of the uploaded file without a path component.

`attachment_type`

: _String, optional._ The special type of this attachment. Possible values are:

- **`event.attachment` (default)**: A standard attachment without special
  meaning.
- `event.minidump`: A minidump file that creates an error event and is
  symbolicated. The file should start with the `MDMP` magic bytes.
- `event.applecrashreport`: An Apple crash report file that creates an error
  event and is symbolicated.
- `unreal.context`: An XML file containing UE4 crash meta data. During event
  ingestion, event contexts and extra fields are extracted from this file.
- `unreal.logs`: A plain-text log file obtained from UE4 crashes. During
  event ingestion, the last logs are extracted into event breadcrumbs.
- `event.view_hierarchy`: An JSON file with a predefined structure, see [RFC #33](https://github.com/getsentry/rfcs/blob/main/text/0033-view-hierarchy.md).

`content_type`

: _String, optional._ The content type of the attachment payload. Any [MIME type](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml) may be used; the default is `application/octet-stream`.

### Session

Item type `"session"` contains a single session initialization or update to an
existing session for Release Health.

See the <Link to="/sdk/telemetry/sessions/">sessions</Link> documentation for the payload
details.

**Constraints:**

- This Item may occur multiple times per Envelope.
- Ingestion may limit the maximum number of Items per Envelope, see _Ingestion_.

**Additional Item Headers:**

_None_

### Sessions

Item type `"sessions"` contains buckets of pre-aggregated session counts.

See the <Link to="/sdk/telemetry/sessions/">sessions</Link> documentation for the payload
details.

**Constraints:**

- This Item may occur multiple times per Envelope.
- Ingestion may limit the maximum number of Items per Envelope, see _Ingestion_.

**Additional Item Headers:**

_None_

### User Feedback

Item type `"feedback"` contains an event with a feedback context in the payload encoded in JSON.

Example payload:

```json
{
  "event_id": "9ec79c33ec9942ab8353589fcb2e04dc",
  "timestamp": "2011-05-02T17:41:36Z",
  "platform": "javascript",
  "level": "error",
  "contexts": {
    "feedback": {
      "contact_email": "john@example.com",
      "name": "John Smith",
      "message": "I love session replay!",
      "url": "https://sentry.io/replays/",
      "associated_event_id": "32fd1995636d446385016e2747623e11",
      "replay_id": "82840977e85b4ed3bc27f7b5b25cec15"
    }
  }
}
```

**Payload Attributes**

We only document attributes for the `contexts.feedback` object, which is **required**
for this item type. For other attributes, see [Event Payloads](/sdk/data-model/event-payloads/).

`message`

: **String, required.** Comments of the user, describing what happened and/or sharing
feedback. The max length is **4096 characters**.

`contact_email`

: _String, optional._ The email of the user who submitted the feedback. If excluded, Sentry attempts to fill this in with user context. Anonymous feedbacks (no name or email) are still accepted.

`name`

: _String, optional._ The name of the user who submitted the feedback. If excluded, Sentry attempts to fill this in with user context. Anonymous feedbacks (no name or email) are still accepted.

`url`

: _String, optional._ The URL of the webpage the user was on when submitting feedback.
This may be used to search for or set alerts on feedback.

`associated_event_id`

: _UUID String, optional._ The identifier of an error event in the same project.
Use this to explicitly link a related error in the feedback UI.

`replay_id`

: _UUID String, optional._ The identifier of a related Session Replay in the same
project. Sentry uses this ID to render a Replay clip in the feedback UI.

**Attaching Screenshots:**

You can associate screenshots with a feedback by sending image data as
[attachment items](/sdk/data-model/envelope-items/#attachment), with `event_id`
corresponding to the feedback item. We recommend sending the items in the same
Envelope.

**Constraints:**

- This Item may occur at most once per Envelope.
- This Item is mutually exclusive with `"transaction"` items.

**Required Envelope Headers:**

`event_id`

: **UUID String, required.** Corresponds to the `event_id` field of the event
payload. **It is not equal to the `associated_event_id`** field in the feedback
context. Clients are required to generate an event identifier ahead of time
and set it at least in the Envelope headers. If the identifier mismatches
between the Envelope and payload, the Envelope header takes precedence.

### User Report - Deprecated

Item type `"user_report"`. This is an older, deprecated way of submitting user feedback. It continues to work so older SDKs won't break. New implementations should follow the `feedback` item type described above.

This item works by associating user information and comments with an event. If both the item and its associated event are accepted, we convert it to a user feedback.

The item contains a JSON payload like this:

```json
{"event_id":"9ec79c33ec9942ab8353589fcb2e04dc","email":"john@example.com","name":"John Me","comments":"It broke."}\n
```

**Payload Attributes**

`event_id`

: **UUID String, required.** The identifier of the associated event, ideally
an error.

`email`

: _String, recommended._ The email of the user.

`name`

: _String, recommended._ The name of the user.

`comments`

: _String, recommended._ Comments of the user about what happened. The max length is **4096 characters**.

**Constraints:**

- This Item may occur once per Envelope.
- User Reports can be ingested separately from their events. However, we recommend
  sending them in the same Envelope.
- You may not associate multiple User Reports to the same event.
- The event can not be more than 30 minutes old.
- If the event does not exist in the same project or was never ingested, the report
  is discarded and never converted to feedback.

**Envelope Headers:**

`event_id`

: **UUID String, required.** Corresponds to the `event_id` field of the payload.
If the identifier mismatches between the Envelope and payload, the Envelope
header takes precedence.

**Additional Item Headers:**

_None_

### Client Report
