title: Span Interface
---

The Span Interface specifies a series of _timed_ application events that have a start and end time.

A [Transaction](/sdk/data-model/event-payloads/transaction/) may contain zero or more Spans in an array attribute named `spans`. Spans in the list don't have to be ordered, they will be ordered by start / end time on the Server.

While Span attributes will be normalized on the server, a Span is most useful when it includes at least an `op` and `description`.

## Attributes

`span_id`:

_Required_. A random hex string with a length of 16 characters.

  ```json
  {
    "span_id": "99659d76b7cdae94"
  }
  ```

`parent_span_id`:

_Optional_. If this Span should be rendered as a child of another Span, set this property to the id of the parent.

  ```json
  {
    "parent_span_id": "b0e6f15b45c36b12"
  }
  ```

`trace_id`:

_Required_. Determines which `trace` the Span belongs to. The value should be 16 random bytes encoded as a hex string (32 characters long).

  ```json
  {
    "trace_id": "1e57b752bc6e4544bbaa246cd1d05dee"
  }
  ```

`op`

_Recommended_. Short code identifying the type of operation the span is measuring.

For more details, see <Link to="/sdk/performance/span-operations/">Sentry's conventions around span operations</Link>.

  ```json
  {
    "op": "db.query"
  }
  ```

`description`

_Optional_. Longer description of the span's operation, which uniquely identifies the span but is consistent across instances of the span.

  ```json
  {
    "description": "SELECT * FROM users WHERE last_active < DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 1 YEAR)`"
  }
  ```

`start_timestamp`

_Required_. A timestamp representing when the measuring started. The
  format is either a string as defined in [RFC
  3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) or a numeric (integer or float)
  value representing the number of seconds that have elapsed since the [Unix
  epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). The `start_timestamp` value must be less than or
  equal to the `timestamp` value, otherwise the Span is discarded as invalid.

  ```json
  {
    "start_timestamp": "2011-05-02T17:41:36.242Z"
  }
  ```

or:

  ```json
  {
    "start_timestamp": 1304358096.242
  }
  ```

`timestamp`

_Required_. A timestamp representing when the measuring finished. The
  format is either a string as defined in [RFC
  3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) or a numeric (integer or float)
  value representing the number of seconds that have elapsed since the [Unix
  epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).

  ```json
  {
    "timestamp": "2011-05-02T17:41:36.955Z"
  }
  ```

or:

  ```json
  {
    "timestamp": 1304358096.955
  }
  ```

`status`

_Optional_. Describes the `status` of the Span/Transaction.

## Examples

The following example illustrates the Span as part of the [Transaction](/sdk/data-model/event-payloads/transaction/) and omits other attributes for simplicity.
