title: Transaction Payloads
---

Transactions are used to send tracing events to Sentry.

Transactions must be wrapped in an [Envelope](/sdk/data-model/envelopes/) and therefore also be sent to the Envelope endpoint.

<Alert title="Note on backwards compatibility">
  Envelopes are a new format and therefore only work on Sentry >= 10. More
  information can be found on the <Link to="/sdk/data-model/envelopes/">Envelope</Link> page.

## Anatomy

A Transaction is basically a [Span](/sdk/data-model/event-payloads/span/) combined with an [Event](/sdk/data-model/event-payloads/). When using
tracing with our SDKs you usually create a Span tree, the root node and therefore the whole tree is considered to be the Transaction.
So technically a Transaction is just a Span. A Transaction must also have a `contexts.trace` (which contains some data of the [Span](/sdk/data-model/event-payloads/span/)) and some other
properties that will be covered in the next section.

Transactions are [Events](/sdk/data-model/event-payloads/) enriched with [Span](/sdk/data-model/event-payloads/span/) data.
We are only going to list here what is important for a Transaction.

`type`

_Required_. A Transaction has to have this value set to `transaction`.

  ```json
  {
    "type": "transaction"
  }
  ```

`start_timestamp`

_Required_. A timestamp representing when the measuring started. The
  format is either a string as defined in [RFC
  3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) or a numeric (integer or float)
  value representing the number of seconds that have elapsed since the [Unix
  epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). The `start_timestamp` value must be less than or
  equal to the `timestamp` value, otherwise the Span is discarded as invalid.

  ```json
  {
    "start_timestamp": "2011-05-02T17:41:36.242Z"
  }
  ```

or:

  ```json
  {
    "start_timestamp": 1304358096.242
  }
  ```

`timestamp`

_Required_. A timestamp representing when the measuring finished. The
  format is either a string as defined in [RFC
  3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) or a numeric (integer or float)
  value representing the number of seconds that have elapsed since the [Unix
  epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).

  ```json
  {
    "timestamp": "2011-05-02T17:41:36.955Z"
  }
  ```

or:

  ```json
  {
    "timestamp": 1304358096.955
  }
  ```

`contexts.trace`

_Recommended_. A Transaction has to have a specific `contexts.trace` entry that contains tracing information. See the [Trace Context documentation](/sdk/data-model/event-payloads/contexts/#trace-context).

```json
{
  "contexts": {
    "trace": {
      "op": "navigation",
      "description": "User clicked on <Link />",
      "trace_id": "743ad8bbfdd84e99bc38b4729e2864de",
      "span_id": "a0cfbde2bdff3adc",
      "status": "ok",
      "parent_span_id": "99659d76b7cdae94"
    }
  }
}
```

`spans`

_Recommended_. A list of [Spans](/sdk/data-model/event-payloads/span/).

```json
{
  "spans": [
    {
      "start_timestamp": 1588601261.481961,
      "description": "GET /sockjs-node/info",
      "tags": {
        "http.status_code": "200"
      },
      "timestamp": 1588601261.488901,
      "parent_span_id": "b0e6f15b45c36b12",
      "trace_id": "1e57b752bc6e4544bbaa246cd1d05dee",
      "op": "http",
      "data": {
        "url": "http://localhost:8080/sockjs-node/info?t=1588601703755",
        "status_code": 200,
        "type": "xhr",
        "method": "GET"
      },
      "span_id": "b01b9f6349558cd1"
    },
    {
      "start_timestamp": 1588601261.535386,
      "description": "Vue <App>",
      "timestamp": 1588601261.544196,
      "parent_span_id": "9312d0d18bf51736",
      "trace_id": "1e57b752bc6e4544bbaa246cd1d05dee",
      "op": "update",
      "span_id": "b980d4dec78d7344"
    }
  ]
}
```

`measurements`

_Optional_. An object containing standard/custom measurements with keys signifying the name of the measurement.

- Standard measurement keys currently supported are from the following list taken from [here](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/blob/a8c960a933d2ded5225841573d8fc426a482ca9c/static/app/utils/discover/fields.tsx#L654-L676).

```json
[
  // Web
  "fp",
  "fcp",
  "lcp",
  "fid",
  "cls",
  "ttfb",
  "ttfb.requesttime",

  // Mobile
  "app_start_cold",
  "app_start_warm",
  "frames_total",
  "frames_slow",
  "frames_frozen",

  // React native
  "frames_slow_rate",
  "frames_frozen_rate",
  "stall_count",
  "stall_total_time",
  "stall_longest_time",
  "stall_percentage"
]
```

- For the well-known measurements listed above, Sentry automatically infers units. Custom measurements need units to be specified; if the units are missing, Relay will set them to `"none"` as a default. The full list of supported units is specified on [Relay's `MetricUnit`](https://getsentry.github.io/relay/relay_metrics/enum.MetricUnit.html). Sentry's event ingestion supports arbitrary custom units, but many SDKs will not expose a generic user-defined unit interface.

```json
{
  "measurements": {
    "lcp": { "value": 100 },
    "fp": { "value": 123 },
    "my.custom.metric": { "value": 456, "unit": "millisecond" }
  }
}
```

## Transaction Annotations

`transaction_info`

_Recommended_. Additional information about the name of the transaction.

```json
{
  "transaction_info": {
    "source": "route"
  }
}
```

`transaction_info.source`

_Required_. This information is required by dynamic sampling.
Contains information about how the name of the transaction was determined.
This will be used by the server to decide whether or not to scrub identifiers
from the transaction name, or replace the entire name with a placeholder. The `source` should
only be set by integrations and not by developers directly.

| Source      | Description                                                                                                                     | <div style={{width:"220px"}}>Examples</div>                |

| `url`       | Raw URL, potentially containing identifiers.                                                                                    | `/auth/login/john123/`<br />`GET /auth/login/john123/` |
| `route`     | Parametrized URL / route                                                                                                        | `/auth/login/:userId/`<br />`GET /auth/login/{user}/`  |
| `view`      | Name of the view handling the request.                                                                                          | `UserListView`                                         |
| `component` | Named after a software component, such as a function or class name.                                                             | `AuthLogin.login`<br /> `LoginActivity.login_button`   |
| `task`      | Name of a background task (e.g. a Celery task)                                                                                  | `sentry.tasks.do_something`                            |
| `unknown`   | _Value set by Relay for legacy SDKs. SDKs must not set this value explicitly._                                                  |                                                        |
