The Message Interface carries a log message that describes an event or error.
Optionally, it can carry a format string and structured parameters. This can
help to group similar messages into the same issue.

## Attributes

`formatted`

: **Required**. The fully formatted message. If missing, Sentry will try to
  interpolate the message.

  A limit of 8192 characters is exposed in Relay and longer messages will be truncated. 
  SDKs should not enforce this limit.
  Sentry also accepts a message where this is not set to support legacy SDKs.

`message`

: _Optional_. The raw message string (uninterpolated).

  A limit of 8192 characters is exposed in Relay and longer messages will be truncated.
  SDKs should not enforce this limit.

`params`

: _Optional_: A list of formatting parameters, preferably strings. Non-strings
  will be coerced to strings.


## Examples

```json
{
  "logentry": {
    "message": "My raw message with interpreted strings like %s",
    "params": ["this"]
  }
}
```
