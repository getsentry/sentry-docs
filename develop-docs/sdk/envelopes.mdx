This document defines the Envelope and Item formats used by Sentry for data
ingestion, forwarding, and offline storage. The target audience of this document
is Sentry SDK developers and maintainers of the ingestion pipeline.

<Alert title="Backward Compatibility" level="info">

Envelopes require Relay, which has been introduced in **Sentry v20.6.0**.
Earlier versions of Sentry do not support Envelopes and respond with HTTP error
_404 Not Found_ to envelope uploads. Likewise, Relay requires support for
Envelopes on the upstream and cannot be used with older versions of Sentry.

</Alert>

*Envelopes* are a data format similar to HTTP form data, comprising common
*Headers* and a set of *Items* with their own headers and payloads. Envelopes
are optimized for fast parsing and human readability. They support a combination
of multiple Items in a single payload, such as:

- Submit events with large binary attachments.
- Enable communication between hops, for instance, between different SDKs
  (Native and Mobile, ReactNative and Android) and between Relays.
- Allow batching of certain Items into a single submission.
- Offline storage for deferred sending after connection issues.

Sentry specifies a dedicated endpoint at for ingesting Envelopes:

```
POST /api/<project_id>/envelope/
```

## Terminology

- *required*: The implementation may emit an error if this field is missing.
- *recommended*: This field should be emitted when writing, but can be missing
  during a read.
- *optional*: Can be omitted freely during writing and can be missing during a
  read.

## Serialization Format

This section defines the Envelope data format and serialization. For details on
data integrity and a list of valid Item types refer to the next section [Data
Model](#data-model).

### Prerequisites

These definitions apply to all parts of the Envelope data format:

1. Newlines are defined as UNIX newlines, represented by `\n` and ASCII code 10.
   If newlines are preceded with `\r`, this character is considered part of the
   previous line or payload and may emit an error.
2. UUIDs are declared as either 32 character hexadecimal strings without dashes
   (`"12c2d058d58442709aa2eca08bf20986"`), or 36 character strings with dashes
   (`"12c2d058-d584-4270-9aa2-eca08bf20986"`). It is recommended to omit dashes
   and use UUID v4 in all cases.
3. Envelopes do not offer a mechanism for compression. However, an entire
   Envelope may be compressed or decompressed in an implementation defined way
   by any component handling Envelopes. For example, [Ingestion](#ingestion)
   allows compression via content encoding.

### Headers

Envelopes contain Headers in several places. Headers are JSON-encoded objects
(key-value mappings) that follow these rules:

- Always encoded in UTF-8
- Must be valid JSON
- Must be declared in a single line; no newlines
- Always followed by a newline (`\n`) or the end of the file
- Must not be padded by leading or trailing whitespace
- Should be serialized in their most compact form without additional white
  space. Whitespace within the JSON headers is permitted, though discouraged.
- Unknown attributes are allowed and should be retained by all implementations;
  however, attributes not covered in this spec must not be actively emitted by
  any implementation.
- All known headers and their data types can be validated by an implementation;
  if validation fails, the Envelope may be rejected as malformed.
- Empty headers `{}` are technically valid

Header-only Example:

```json
{"event_id":"12c2d058d58442709aa2eca08bf20986"}
```

### Envelopes

The full grammar for an Envelope is:

```
Envelope = Headers { "\n" Item } [ "\n" ] ;
Item = Headers "\n" Payload ;
Payload = { * } ;
```

- **Headers** are a single line containing a JSON object, as defined in the
  [Headers](#headers) section. Attributes defined in the Envelope header scope
  the contents of the Envelope and can be thought of as applying to all Items.
- Based on the contents of the Envelope, certain header attributes may be
  required. See [Data Model](#data-model) for a specification of required
  attributes.
- **Items** comprise their own headers and a payload. There can be
  an arbitrary number of **Items** in an Envelope separated by a newline. An
  implementation should consume Items until the file ends.
- Envelopes should be terminated with a trailing newline. This newline is
  optional. After the final newline, no whitespace is allowed.
- Envelopes may be empty, terminating immediately after the headers.
- The end of file (EOF) does not implicitly terminate an Envelope if more data
  is expected, such as a Payload.

### Envelope Headers

Envelopes can have a number of headers which are valid in all situations:

`dsn`

: *String, recommended.* An envelope can be self authenticated.  This means that
  the envelope has all the information necessary to be sent to sentry.  In this
  case the full DSN must be stored in this key.

`sdk`

: *Object, recommended.* This can carry the same payload as the <Link to="/sdk/event-payloads/sdk/">`sdk` interface</Link>
  in the event payload but can be carried for all events. This means that SDK
  information can be carried for minidumps, session data and other submissions.

`sent_at`

: *String, recommended.* The timestamp when the event was sent from the SDK as string in
  [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) format. Used for clock drift
  correction of the event timestamp. The time zone must be UTC.

<Alert title="Implementation Guidance for the sent_at Header" level="info">

It is recommend to *always* send the `sent_at` envelope header. Do not try to determine
whether it should be sent or not, as that determination can be made on the receiving side.

The timestamp should be generated as close as possible to the transmision of the event,
so that the delay between sending the envelope and receiving it on the server-side
is minimized. This is usually accomplished in serialization of the envelope header.

However, care must be taken that the header is only applied *once*. If more than one `sent_at`
header is written, Sentry will reject the entire envelope.  For example, SDKs that implement
caching features should avoid writing the `sent_at` header when caching to disk.
Only write it when actually sending the event to Sentry.

The timestamp can be generated by any of the following (for example):

JavaScript

: `new Date().toISOString()`

Python

: `datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat()`<br />  
  *Don't use `datetime.utcnow()`, as it will omit the time zone.*

.NET

: `DateTime.UtcNow.ToString("o", CultureInfo.InvariantCulture)`  
  or  
  `DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.ToString("o", CultureInfo.InvariantCulture)`

Java

: `Instant.now().toString()`

*Also note that the `sent_at` header replaces the `sentry_timestamp` key previously set in authorization headers,
which has now been fully deprecated.  You should only send `sent_at`, and not `sentry_timestamp`.*

</Alert>

### Items

Items supply the data of an Envelope. Without Items, an Envelope is considered
*empty* and can safely be discarded.

There are two generic headers for every Item:

`type`

: **String, required.** Specifies the type of this Item and its contents. Based
  on the Item type, more headers may be required. See [Data Model](#data-model) for a list
  of all Item types.

`length`

: *int, recommended.* The length of the payload in bytes. If no `length` is
  specified, the payload implicitly goes to the next newline. For payloads
  containing newline characters, the `length` must be specified.

<Alert title="On omitting `length`" level="warning">
By default, always declare the payload length to enable faster parsing of an
Envelope.

If the Envelope contains a large number of very small Items, omitting the length
can be beneficial for compression. This is the case for sessions.

The implementor should assess this on a per-case basis and explicitly argue
about the decision.
</Alert>

Notes for implementors:

- Envelope header is **required**, but it can be empty.
- Implementations **must gracefully skip and retain** Items of unknown type,
  along with their payload.
- Unknown attributes must be forwarded to the upstream.
- Length-prefixed payloads must terminate with `\n` or EOF. The newline is not
  considered part of the payload. Any other character, including whitespace,
  means the Envelope is malformed.
- If `length` cannot be consumed, that is, the Envelope is EOF before the number
  of bytes has been consumed, then the Envelope is malformed.
- If an Item with implicit length is terminated by `\r\n`, then `\r` is
  considered an arbitrary character not part of the newline, and thus part of
  the payload.

### Full Examples

These examples contain full Envelope payloads. Newlines are explicitly marked
with `\n`, unprintable characters are escaped with `\x<><>`. all other
characters are literal.

**Envelope with 2 Items:**

Note that the attachment contains a Windows newline at the end of its
payload which is included in `length`:

```
{"event_id":"9ec79c33ec9942ab8353589fcb2e04dc","dsn":"https://e12d836b15bb49d7bbf99e64295d995b:@sentry.io/42"}\n
{"type":"attachment","length":10,"content_type":"text/plain","filename":"hello.txt"}\n
\xef\xbb\xbfHello\r\n\n
{"type":"event","length":41,"content_type":"application/json","filename":"application.log"}\n
{"message":"hello world","level":"error"}\n
```

**Envelope with 2 Items, last newline omitted:**

Note that the attachment contains a Windows newline at the end of its
payload which is included in `length`:

```
{"event_id":"9ec79c33ec9942ab8353589fcb2e04dc","dsn":"https://e12d836b15bb49d7bbf99e64295d995b:@sentry.io/42"}\n
{"type":"attachment","length":10,"content_type":"text/plain","filename":"hello.txt"}\n
\xef\xbb\xbfHello\r\n\n
{"type":"event","length":41,"content_type":"application/json","filename":"application.log"}\n
{"message":"hello world","level":"error"}
```

**Envelope with 2 empty attachments:**

```
{"event_id":"9ec79c33ec9942ab8353589fcb2e04dc"}\n
{"type":"attachment","length":0}\n
\n
{"type":"attachment","length":0}\n
\n
```

**Envelope with 2 empty attachments, last newline omitted:**

```
{"event_id":"9ec79c33ec9942ab8353589fcb2e04dc"}\n
{"type":"attachment","length":0}\n
\n
{"type":"attachment","length":0}\n
```

**Item with implicit length, terminated by newline:**

```
{"event_id":"9ec79c33ec9942ab8353589fcb2e04dc"}\n
{"type":"attachment"}\n
helloworld\n
```

**Item with implicit length, last newline omitted, terminated by EOF:**

```
{"event_id":"9ec79c33ec9942ab8353589fcb2e04dc"}\n
{"type":"attachment"}\n
helloworld
```

**Envelope without headers, implicit length, last newline omitted, terminated by
EOF:**

```
{}\n
{"type":"session"}\n
{"started": "2020-02-07T14:16:00Z","attrs":{"release":"sentry-test@1.0.0"}}
```

## Data Model

Each Envelope consists of headers and a potentially empty list of Items, each
with their own headers. Which Headers are required depends on the Items in an
Envelope. This section describes all Item types and their respective required
headers. It is worth noting that the list of Item types doesn't match the data
categories used for [rate limiting](/sdk/rate-limiting/#definitions) and
client reports.

The type of an Item is declared in the `type` header, as well as the payload
size in `length`. See Serialization Format for a list of common Item headers.
The headers described in this section are **in addition to the common headers**.

### Event

Item type `"event"`. This Item contains an error or default event payload
encoded in JSON.

**Constraints:**

- This Item may occur at most once per Envelope.
- This Item is mutually exclusive with `"transaction"` Items.

**Envelope Headers:**

`event_id`

: **UUID String, required.** Corresponds to the `event_id` field of the event
  payload. Clients are required to generate an event identifier ahead of time
  and set it at least in the Envelope headers. If the identifier mismatches
  between the Envelope and payload, the Envelope header takes precedence.

**Additional Item Headers:**

*None*

### Transaction

Item type `"transaction"`. This Item contains a transaction payload encoded
in JSON.

**Constraints:**

- This Item may occur at most once per Envelope.
- This Item is mutually exclusive with `"event"` Items.

**Envelope Headers:**

`event_id`

: **UUID String, required.** Corresponds to the `event_id` field of the
  transaction payload. Clients are required to generate an event identifier
  ahead of time and set it at least in the Envelope headers. If the identifier
  mismatches between the Envelope and payload, the Envelope header takes
  precedence.

**Additional Item Headers:**

*None*

### Attachment

Item type `"attachment"`. This Item contains a raw payload of an attachment
file. It is always associated to an event or transaction.

**Constraints:**

- This Item may occur multiple times per Envelope.
- For **minidump** and **apple crash report** attachments, the corresponding
  `"event"` Item must be sent within the same Envelope.
- Generic attachments can be ingested separately from their events. We recommend
  sending them in the same Envelope, which allows for more efficient rate
  limiting and filtering.
- Generic attachments sent in separate Envelopes can be dropped independently of
  an event. To ensure consistent handling, consider sending them in the same
  request.
- The Sentry server supports special attachments to ingest event payloads for
  backwards compatibility. These are not part of the official public API and the
  behavior should not be relied upon.

**Envelope Headers:**

`event_id`

: **UUID String, required.** The identifier of the event or transaction.

**Additional Item Headers:**

`filename`

: **String, required.**  The name of the uploaded file without a path component.

`attachment_type`

: *String, optional.* The special type of this attachment. Possible values are:

  - **`event.attachment` (default)**: A standard attachment without special
    meaning.
  - `event.minidump`: A minidump file that creates an error event and is
    symbolicated. The file should start with the `MDMP` magic bytes.
  - `event.applecrashreport`: An Apple crash report file that creates an error
    event and is symbolicated.
  - `unreal.context`: An XML file containing UE4 crash meta data. During event
    ingestion, event contexts and extra fields are extracted from this file.
  - `unreal.logs`: A plain-text log file obtained from UE4 crashes. During
    event ingestion, the last logs are extracted into event breadcrumbs.

`content_type`

: *String, optional.* The content type of the attachment payload. Any [MIME type](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml) may be used; the default is `application/octet-stream`.

### Session

Item type `"session"` contains a single session initialization or update to an
existing session for Release Health.

See the <Link to="/sdk/sessions/">sessions</Link> documentation for the payload
details.

**Constraints:**

- This Item may occur multiple times per Envelope.
- Ingestion may limit the maximum number of Items per Envelope, see *Ingestion*.

**Additional Item Headers:**

*None*

### Sessions

Item type `"sessions"` contains buckets of pre-aggregated session counts.

See the <Link to="/sdk/sessions/">sessions</Link> documentation for the payload
details.

**Constraints:**

- This Item may occur multiple times per Envelope.
- Ingestion may limit the maximum number of Items per Envelope, see *Ingestion*.

**Additional Item Headers:**

*None*

### User Feedback

User Feedback was called User Report in the beginning. Therefore the envelope item type is `"user_report"`. 
The item contains a user feedback / user report JSON payload:
```json
{"event_id":"9ec79c33ec9942ab8353589fcb2e04dc","email":"john@me.com","name":"John Me","comments":"It broke."}\n
```

**Attributes**

`event_id`

: **UUID String, required.** The identifier of the event or transaction.


`email`

: *String, recommended.* The email of the user.

`name`

: *String, recommended.* The name of the user.

`comments`

: *String, recommended.* Comments of the user about what happened. 

**Constraints:**

- This Item may occur once per Envelope.
- User Feedbacks / Reports can be ingested separately from their events. We recommended to
  send them in the same Envelope.

**Envelope Headers:**

`event_id`

: **UUID String, required.** The identifier of the event or transaction.

**Additional Item Headers:**

*None*

### Client Report

Item type `"client_report"` contains a client report payload encoded in JSON.

See the <Link to="/sdk/client-reports/">client reports</Link> documentation for the payload
details.

**Constraints:**

- This Item may occur multiple times per Envelope, but please avoid sending more client reports than necessary.
- This Item can either be included in an Envelope with other Items, or it may be sent by itself.

**Envelope Headers:**

*None*

**Additional Item Headers:**

*None*

### Profile

Item type `"profile"`. This Item contains a profile payload encoded
in JSON.

**Constraints:**

- This Item may occur at most once per Envelope.
- This Item needs to be in the same Envelope as the associated transaction.

**Envelope Headers:**

*None*

**Additional Item Headers:**

*None*

### Check-Ins

Item type `"check_in"` contains a check-in payload encoded as JSON.

See the <Link to="/sdk/check-ins/">Check-Ins</Link> documentation for the payload
details.

**Constraints:**

- This Item may occur at most once per Envelope.
- This Item can either be included in an Envelope with other Items, or it may be sent by itself.

**Envelope Headers:**

*None*

**Additional Item Headers:**

*None*

### Reserved Types

Reserved types may not be written by any implementation. They are reserved for
future or internal use. This is the exhaustive list of reserved Item types:

- `security`
- `unreal_report`
- `form_data`

## Ingestion

This section describes how to ingest Envelopes into Relay or Sentry. The main
ingestion endpoint for Envelopes is:

```
POST /api/<project_id>/envelope/
```

### HTTP Headers

Envelope requests may contain all headers as regular store requests. The only
accepted `content-type` is `application/x-sentry-envelope`, which is implied if
it is missing.  To minimize the necessity for `CORS` preflights it's
acceptable to send `text/plain`, `multipart/form-data` and
`application/x-www-form-urlencoded` as well.  In either of those cases the
behavior however is the same as using `application/x-sentry-envelope`.

### Authentication

In addition to regular HTTP header- and querystring authentication, the Envelope
endpoint allows to authenticate via an Envelope header. To choose this
authentication method, set the `"dsn"` Envelope header to the full DSN string.

If multiple forms of authentication are given, the endpoint validates that the
information matches and otherwise rejects the request. If both are missing, the
Envelope is rejected with status code `403 Forbidden`.

<Alert title="Backward Compatibility" level="info">

Envelope header authentication requires **Relay v21.6.0**.
Earlier versions of Relay do not support Envelope header authentication and respond with HTTP error
_401 Unauthorized ("missing authorization information")_ to envelope uploads.

SDKs should not rely on Envelope header authentication to retain backward compatibility with older versions of Sentry on-premise unless absolutely required. Instead, stick to HTTP headers or query parameters wherever possible.

</Alert>

### Size Limits

Event ingestion imposes limits on the size and number of Items in Envelopes.
These limits are subject to future change and defined currently as:

- *20MB* for a compressed Envelope request
- *100MB* for a full Envelope after decompression
- *100MB* for all attachments combined
- *100MB* for each attachment Item
- *1MB* for event and transaction Items
- *100 sessions* per Envelope
- *100 pre-aggregated session buckets* per each `"sessions"` Item
- *100KB* for monitor Check-ins
