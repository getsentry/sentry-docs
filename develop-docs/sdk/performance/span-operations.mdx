title: "Span Operations"
---

Span operations are a short code identifying the type of operation the span is measuring. Span operations are low cardinality attributes - they should be as general as possible while still being human readable and useful. They should avoid including high cardinality data like IDs and URLs.

Operations are expected to follow [OpenTelemetry's semantic conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/24de67b3827a4e3ab2515cd8ab62d5bcf837c586/specification/trace/semantic_conventions/README.md) as much as possible.

It's important to keep categories consistent between SDKs and integrations as they are used by Sentry in the [Operations Breakdown](https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-basics/tracing/event-detail/#operations-breakdown) feature. For example, both `db.init` and `db.query` will be categorized as database operations (`db`). The default operations breakdown config can be seen [here](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/blob/9f36200d665209c9328f5ccc21135d3de9b65318/src/sentry/projectoptions/defaults.py#L80).

<Alert title="Note" level="info">
  Span operations should be lower case and use snake_case

# List of Operations

The following tables contain examples of operations used by the SDKs and Sentry product. The usage column in the table contains examples of using that operation category, but are not hard recommendations for operation usage. As long as categories stay consistent, SDK developers are free to choose actions and identifiers that best match the use case they are instrumenting.

If a span operation is not provided, the value of `default` is set by Relay. The value `default` can also be set by SDKs, for example, to avoid breaking changes when no longer requiring `op` to be set on `TransactionContext`.

## Web Server

Web server related spans should aim to follow OpenTelemetry's [HTTP](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/semantic_conventions/http.md) and [RPC](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/semantic_conventions/rpc.md) semantic conventions when possible.
