title: 'Requests Module'
---

The SDK should auto-instrument all outgoing HTTP requests, regardless of the library that issues the requests. Each outgoing request should result in a span. The Requests module is technology agnostic, it only cares about span data properties.

## Span Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Notes |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `op` | Always `"http.client"` | Required |
| `description` | A string including the HTTP request method, and the full URL. e.g., `"GET https://example.com/data.json?filter=all"` | Required [^1] |
| `data` | A key-value mapping of span attributes. (e.g., `{"http.query": "filter=all", "server.address": "prod-2.example.com"}`) | Required for full experience. See [Span Data](#span-data) for details |

### Span Data

None of the span data fields are hard requirements, but attaching as many of them as possible is a more future-proof approach. We recommend that the SDK adds every attribute listed in the [HTTP Span Data Conventions](/sdk/performance/span-data-conventions/#http). The minimal requirements are:

- `server.address` must be set to allow correct domain grouping _for descriptions containing relative URLs_. e.g., the description `"GET /data.json"` is missing a domain. In this case, `server.address` must be set. If the span description contains the full URL, `span.server` can be omitted
- `http.response.status_code` must be set to enable response code breakdowns

## Instrumentation Example

Consider a website called "App Ex", running on `app.example.com`. This JavaScript code that issues an HTTP request from the browser:

```javascript
fetch("/data.json?user=1")
```

Should result in the following span, assuming the request was successful:

```json
{
  "description": "GET /data.json?user=1",
  "op": "http.client",
  "data": {
    "http.query": "user=1",
    "http.request_method": "GET",
    "http.response.status_code": 200,
    "http.fragment": "",
    "server.address": "app.example.com",
    "server.port": 8080,
    ... other span properties
  }
}
```
