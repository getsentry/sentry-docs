title: 'Requests Module'
---

The SDK should auto-instrument all outgoing HTTP requests, regardless of the library that issues the requests. Each outgoing request should result in a span.

## Span Conventions

### Span Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
|:--|:--|
| `op` | Always `http.client` |
| `description` | A string including the HTTP request method, and the URL. e.g., `"GET https://example.com/data.json"` | The HTTP method must be one of the [known HTTP request methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) |

### Span Data

Refer to [HTTP Span Data Conventions](/sdk/performance/span-data-conventions/#http) for a full list of the span data attributes. Note these caveats:

- the `server.address` span data attribute is only required if the URL is relative

## Instrumentation

The SDK should create a span when the HTTP request is complete, and attach all the relevant available data.

**Example**

Consider the website `example.com`. This code, running on the page:

```javascript
fetch("/data.json")
```

Should result in the following span, assuming the request was successful:

```json
{
  "description": "GET /data.json?user=1",
  "op": "http.client",
  "data": {
    "http.query": "user=1",
    "http.request_method": "GET",
    "http.response.status_code": 200,
    "http.fragment": "",
    "server.address": "example.com"
    ... other span properties
  }
}
```

NOTE: Refer to [HTTP Span Data Conventions](/sdk/performance/span-data-conventions/#http) for a full list of properties you can attach to an `http.client` span.
