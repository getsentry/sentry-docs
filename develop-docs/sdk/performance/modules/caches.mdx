title: 'Caches Module'
---

The SDK's caching integration is agnostic to the underlying engine used. In most cases, the SDK will instrument existing cache abstractions in certain frameworks or libraries.

## Span conventions

### Span Operations

| Span OP | Description |
|:--|:--|
| `cache.get` | A single item or multiple items are retrieved from the cache |
| `cache.put` | A single item or multiple items are written to the cache |
| `cache.remove` | A single item or multiple items are removed from the cache |
| `cache.flush` | The entire content of the cache is deleted |

### Span Description

The description of cache spans should be set to the cache key(s), sepreated by commas, e.g. `posts`, or `article1, article2`.

### Span Data

| Data Key | Type | Description | Conditions
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| `cache.hit` | bool | cache hit or miss | required only on read-operations (`cache.get`)
| `cache.key` | array | the key(s) involved in the operation | required only on operations that have a key

The following data attributes are only to be set if exposed by the instrumented cache abstraction or retrievable with minimal overhead.

| Data Key | Type | Description | Conditions
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| `cache.item_size ` | int | the size of the item/items read/written/deleted in `bytes` | only on operations that have a key
| `cache.success ` | bool | the operation has succeeded or failed | 
| `cache.ttl ` | int | the time to life in `seconds` | only on operations that have a key
| `network.peer.address` | string | The hostname of the cache instance |
| `network.peer.port` | int | the port used by the cache instance | 

## Instrumentation

Once an application performs a caching operation, the SDK creates a new span based on the operation, wrapping any spans of the underlying engine as direct children.

**Example**

```
item = Cache::get('posts')
```

This should result in the following spans, assuming a cache hit with an underlying Redis instance being used.

```
<span op:"cache.get" description:"posts" cache.key:"posts" cache.hit=true>
	<span op:db.redis description:"GET posts"></span>
</span>
```

### SDK Options

If convenient, the SDK can optionally offer a `cache_prefixes` option, that wraps existing instrumentations into a cache span.
This will likely only be useful if Redis is being used as a cache.

```
Sentry.init({
  integrations: [
    redisIntegration({
	    cachePrefixes: ['posts:', 'authors:'],
    }),
  ],
})
```

In this example, all Redis queries involving keys that match `posts:*` and `authors:*` will be wrapped into `cache.*` span.
