title: "Time to Initial/Full Display"
---

We recommend implementing this feature for mobile and desktop SDKs.

The current screen load transactions timings are unreliable in understanding the time spent in the screen creation.
This is because they wait for any span created, including any file I/O or network request.
Time to Initial Display and Time to Full Display are spans added to the screen load transactions,
which can be used to show more accurate information on the time spent in the screen creation.
Being spans, they don't impact user quota.

The SDK starts them as soon as a new screen is created, as long as there is an active transaction for the screen load.
Note: When the app is started, the SDK aligns the start timestamp of the Time to Initial Display and Time to Full Display to the app start timestamp.

## Time to Initial Display

Time to Initial Display is a span with the operation `ui.load.initial_display`, which finishes automatically
when the screen draws its first frame. It's controlled automatically by the SDK and doesn't
require any manual intervention from the user.

The SDKs set the time to initial display as a transaction measurement, with `time_to_initial_display` as the key and the span duration as the value.
Note: The measurement should be set only if the span finishes with the status `OK`. In case a screen is used just as a
 router to start other screens, it could be finished before drawing a frame.


## Time to Full Display

Time to Full Display is a span with operation `ui.load.full_display` which is finished manually through
the `Sentry.reportFullyDisplayed` static API. This feature has to be enabled by setting the SDK config
option `enableTimeToFullDisplayTracing`. Remember that the screen load transactions wait for spans to finish,
so the transaction will run until the user calls the API. So we recommend this feature to be disabled by default.
It's also set as a measurement of the transaction, with `time_to_full_display` as key and the span duration as value.

The following section explains the possible scenarios of the Time to Full Display.

The specification is written in the [Gherkin syntax](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/).

```Gherkin
Scenario: Option disabled
    Given an ongoing screen load/navigation transaction
    Then the SDK doesn't start the Full Display span
    When the user calls the manual API `reportFullyDisplayed`
    Then the SDK ignores the call

Scenario: Option enabled
    Given the enableTimeToFullDisplay option is enabled
    When the SDK creates a new screen load transaction
    Then the Full Display span is started

Scenario: App started
    Given the enableTimeToFullDisplay option is enabled
    When the app starts
    Then the SDK sets the start timestamp of the Time to Initial Display and Time to Full Display span to the app start timestamp
    And the SDK updates the `time_to_initial_display` and `time_to_full_display` measurements accordingly

Scenario: Screen displayed
    Given an ongoing Full Display span
    And the SDK finished the  Initial Display span
    When the user calls the API `reportFullyDisplayed`
    Then the SDK finishes the span
    And sets the status to ok

Scenario: API not called
    Given an ongoing Full Display span
    When the user doesn't call the API `reportFullyDisplayed` in 30 seconds
    Then the SDK finishes the span
    And sets the status to deadline_exceeded
    And sets the timestamp to the timestamp of the Initial Display span
    And the SDK updates the `time_to_full_display` measurement accordingly

Scenario: API called
    Given an ongoing Full Display span
    When the user calls the API `reportFullyDisplayed`
    Then the SDK finishes the Full Display span
    And set the status to ok

Scenario: API called too early
    Given an ongoing Initial Display span
    And the user called the API `reportFullyDisplayed`
    When the SDK finishes the Initial Display span
    Then the SDK sets the status to ok
    And the SDK adjusts the Full Display span end timestamp to the Initial Display span end timestamp
    And the SDK updates the `time_to_full_display` measurement accordingly

Scenario: Another screen load/navigation transaction occurs
    Given an ongoing Full Display span
    When a new screen load/navigation transaction is started
    Then the SDK finishes the Full Display span
    And the SDK sets the status to deadline_exceeded
    And the SDK sets the end timestamp to the Initial Display span end timestamp
    And the SDK updates the `time_to_full_display` measurement accordingly

Scenario: No ongoing screen load transaction
    Given there is no active screen load transaction
    When the user calls the manual API `reportFullyDisplayed`
    Then the SDK ignores the call

```
