title: "Trace Origin"
---

Trace origin indicates what created a trace or a span. Not all traces and spans contain enough information
to tell whether the user or what precisely in the SDK created it. Origin solves this problem. Origin can be sent with
the <Link to="/sdk/event-payloads/contexts/#trace-context">trace context</Link> or <Link to="/sdk/event-payloads/span/">spans</Link>.


The origin is of type `string` and consists of four parts: `<type>.<category>.<integration-name>.<integration-part>`.
Only the first is mandatory. The parts build upon each other, meaning it is forbidden
to skip one part. For example, you may send parts one and two but aren't allowed to send parts one and three without part two.

`type`

: _Required_. Can be either `manual` or `auto`. `manual` indicates that the user created the trace or span, `auto` indicates
that the SDK or some integration created it.

`category` 

: _Optional_. Is the category of the trace or span, and it must be a category of <Link to="/sdk/performance/span-operations/#currently-used-categories">span operations</Link>. For example, `http`, `db`, `ui`, `navigation`, `file`, `browser`, `rpc`, etc.

`integration-name` 

: _Optional_. Is the name of the integration of the SDK that created the trace or span. 

`integration-part`

: _Optional_. Is the part of the integration of the SDK that created the trace or span.


All parts can only contain:

* Alphanumeric characters: `a-z` , `A-Z` , and `0-9`.
* Underscores: `_`
* Dots: `.`
