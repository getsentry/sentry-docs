title: "Guidelines for Performance Monitoring"
---

This document covers how SDKs should add support for Performance Monitoring with [Distributed
Tracing](https://docs.sentry.io/product/performance/distributed-tracing/).

This should give an overview of the APIs that SDKs need to implement, without
mandating internal implementation details.

Reference implementations:

- [`@sentry/tracing`
  (JavaScript)](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/tree/master/packages/tracing)
- [Python SDK](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/blob/master/sentry_sdk/tracing.py)

## SDK Configuration

This section describes the options SDKs should expose to configure tracing and performance monitoring.

Tracing is enabled by setting either one of two new SDK config options, `tracesSampleRate` and `tracesSampler`. If not set, both default to `undefined`, making tracing opt-in.

### `tracesSampleRate`

This should be a float/double between `0.0` and `1.0` (inclusive) and represents the percentage chance that any given transaction will be sent to Sentry. So, barring [outside influence](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/performance/#sampling), `0.0` is a 0% chance (none will be sent) and `1.0` is a 100% chance (all will be sent). This rate applies equally to all transactions; in other words, each transaction should have the same random chance of ending up with `sampled = true`, equal to the `tracesSampleRate`.

See more about how sampling should be performed below.

### `tracesSampler`

This should be a callback, called when a transaction is started, which will be given a `samplingContext` object and which should return a sample rate between `0.0` and `1.0` _for the transaction in question_. This sample rate should behave the same way as the `tracesSampleRate` above, with the difference that it only applies to the newly-created transaction, such that different transactions can be sampled at different rates. Returning `0.0` should force the transaction to be dropped (set to `sampled = false`) and returning `1.0` should force the transaction to be sent (set `sampled = true`).

Optionally, the `tracesSampler` callback can also return a boolean to force a sampling decision (with `false` equivalent to `0.0` and `true` equivalent to `1.0`). If returning two different datatypes isn't an option in the implementing language, this possibility can safely be omitted.

See more about how sampling should be performed below.

### `tracePropagationTargets`

Sentry SDKs propagate trace information to downstream SDKs via headers on outgoing HTTP requests. The `tracePropagationTargets` option gives users a mechanism of controlling to which outgoing HTTP requests these headers should be attached. For example, users can specify this property to keep trace propagation within their infrastructure, thereby preventing data within the headers from being sent to third party services.

This option takes an array of strings and/or regular expressions. SDKs should only add trace headers to an outgoing request if the request's URL matches the regex or, in the case of string literals, contains at least one of the items from the array. String literals do not have to be full matches, meaning the URL of a request is matched when it contains a string provided through the option.

SDKs may choose a default value which makes sense for their use case. Most SDKs default to the regex `.*` (meaning they attach headers to all outgoing requests), but deviation is allowed if necessary. For example, because of CORS, browser-based SDKs default to only adding headers to domain-internal requests.

See [`sentry-trace`](#header-sentry-trace) and [`baggage`](/sdk/performance/dynamic-sampling-context/#baggage) for more details on the individual headers which are attached to outgoing requests.

### `traceOptionsRequests`

This should be a boolean value. Default is `false`. When set to `true` transactions should be created for HTTP `OPTIONS` requests. When set to `false` NO transactions should be created for HTTP `OPTIONS` requests. This configuration is most valuable on backend server SDKs. If this configuration does not make sense for an SDK it can be omitted.

#### Example

The following example shows which URLs of outgoing requests would (not) match a given `tracePropagationTargets` array:

```JS
// Entries can be strings or regex
tracePropagationTargets: ['localhost', /^\// ,/myApi.com\/v[2-4]/]

URLs matching: 'localhost:8443/api/users', 'mylocalhost:8080/api/users', '/api/envelopes', 'myApi.com/v2/projects'
URLs not matching: 'someHost.com/data', 'myApi.com/v1/projects'
```

<Alert level="info" title="Deprecation of tracingOrigins">

This Option replaces the non-standardized `tracingOrigins` option which was previously used in some SDKs. SDKs that support `tracingOrigins` are encouraged to deprecate and and eventually remove `tracingOrigins` in favour `tracePropagationTargets`. In case both options are specified by users, SDKs should only rely on the `tracePropagationTargets` array.

</Alert>

### `maxSpans`

Because transaction payloads have a maximum size enforced on the ingestion side, SDKs should limit the number of spans that are attached to a transaction. This is similar to how breadcrumbs and other arbitrarily sized lists are limited to prevent accidental misuse. If new spans are added once the maximum is reached, the SDK should drop the spans and ideally use the internal logging to help debugging.

The `maxSpans` should be implemented as an internal, non-configurable, constant that defaults to 1000. It may become configurable if there is justification for that in a given platform.

The `maxSpans` limit may also help avoiding transactions that never finish (in platforms that keep a transaction open for as long as spans are open), preventing OOM errors, and generally avoiding degraded application performance.

## `Event` Changes

As of writing, transactions are implemented as an extension of the `Event`
model.

The distinctive feature of a `Transaction` is `type: "transaction"`.

Apart from that, the `Event` gets new fields: `spans`, `contexts.TraceContext`.

## New `Span` and `Transaction` Classes

In memory, spans build up a conceptual tree of timed operations. We call the whole span tree a transaction. Sometimes we use the term "transaction" to refer to a span tree as a whole tree, sometimes to refer specifically to the root span of the tree.

Over the wire, transactions are serialized to JSON as an augmented `Event`, and sent as envelopes. The different envelope types are for optimizing ingestion (so we can route "transaction events" differently than other events, mostly "error events").

In the Sentry UI, you can use Discover to look at all events regardless of type, and the Issues and Performance sections to dive into errors and transactions, respectively. The [user-facing tracing documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/product/performance/distributed-tracing/#traces-transactions-and-spans) explains more of the concepts on the product level.

The [Span](/sdk/event-payloads/span/) class stores each individual span in a
trace.

The [Transaction](/sdk/event-payloads/transaction/) class is like a span, with a
few key differences:

- Transactions have `name`, spans don't.
- Transactions must specify the [source](/sdk/event-payloads/transaction/#transaction-annotations) of its `name` to indicate how the transaction name was generated.
- Calling the `finish` method on spans record the span's end timestamp. For
  transactions, the `finish` method additionally sends an event to Sentry.

The `Transaction` class may inherit from `Span`, but that's an implementation
detail. Semantically, transactions represent both the top-level span of a span
tree as well as the unit of reporting to Sentry.

- `Span` Interface

  - When a `Span` is created, set the `startTimestamp` to the current time
  - `SpanContext` is the attribute collection for a `Span` (Can be an implementation detail). When possible `SpanContext` should be immutable.
  - `Span` should have a method `startChild` which creates a new span with the current span's id as the new span's `parentSpanId` and the current span's `sampled` value copied over to the new span's `sampled` property
  - The `startChild` method should respect the `maxSpans` limit, and once the limit is reached the SDK should not create new child spans for the given transaction.
  - `Span` should have a method called `toSentryTrace` which returns a string that could be sent as a header called `sentry-trace`.
  - `Span` should have a method called `iterHeaders` (adapt to platform's naming conventions) that returns an iterable or map of header names and values. This is a thin wrapper containing `return {"sentry-trace": toSentryTrace()}` right now. See `continueFromHeaders` as to why this exists and should be preferred when writing integrations.

- `Transaction` Interface

  - A `Transaction` internally holds a flat list of child Spans (not a tree structure)
  - `Transaction` has additionally a `setName` method that sets the name of the transaction
  - `Transaction` receives a `TransactionContext` on creation (new property vs. `SpanContext` is `name`)
  - Since a `Transaction` inherits a `Span` it has all functions available and can be interacted with like it was a `Span`
  - A transaction is either sampled (`sampled = true`) or unsampled (`sampled = false`), a decision which is either inherited or set once during the transaction's lifetime, and in either case is propagated to all children. Unsampled transactions should not be sent to Sentry.
  - `TransactionContext` should have a static/ctor method called `fromSentryTrace` which prefills a `TransactionContext` with data received from a `sentry-trace` header value
  - `TransactionContext` should have a static/ctor method called `continueFromHeaders(headerMap)` which is really just a thin wrapper around `fromSentryTrace(headerMap.get("sentry-trace"))` right now. This should be preferred by integration/framework-sdk authors over `fromSentryTrace` as it hides the exact header names used deeper in the core sdk, and leaves opportunity for using additional headers (from the W3C) in the future without changing all integrations.

- `Span.finish()`

  - Accepts an optional `endTimestamp` to allow users to set a custom `endTimestamp` on the finished span
  - If an `endTimestamp` value is not provided, set `endTimestamp` to the current time (in payload `timestamp`)

- `Transaction.finish()`
  - `super.finish()` (call finish on Span)
  - Send it to Sentry only if `sampled == true`
  - Like spans, can be given an optional `endTimestamp` value that should be passed into the `span.finish()` call
  - A `Transaction` needs to be wrapped in an `Envelope` and sent to the [Envelope Endpoint](/sdk/envelopes/)
  - The `Transport` should use the same internal queue for `Transactions` / `Events`
  - The `Transport` should implement category-based rate limiting →
  - The `Transport` should deal with wrapping a `Transaction` in an `Envelope` internally

## Sampling

Each transaction has a "sampling decision," that is, a boolean which dictates whether or not it should be sent to Sentry. This should be set exactly once during a transaction's lifetime, and should be stored in an internal `sampled` boolean.

There are multiple ways a transaction can end up with a sampling decision:

- Random sampling according to a static sample rate set in `tracesSampleRate`
- Random sampling according to a dynamic sample rate returned by `tracesSampler`
- Absolute decision (100% chance or 0% chance) returned by `tracesSampler`
- If the transaction has a parent, inheriting its parent's sampling decision
- Absolute decision passed to `startTransaction`

When there's the potential for more than one of these to come into play, the following precedence rules should apply:

1. If a sampling decision is passed to `startTransaction` (`startTransaction({name: "my transaction", sampled: true})`), that decision will be used, regardlesss of anything else
2. If `tracesSampler` is defined, its decision will be used. It can choose to keep or ignore any parent sampling decision, or use the sampling context data to make its own decision or choose a sample rate for the transaction.
3. If `tracesSampler` is not defined, but there's a parent sampling decision, the parent sampling decision will be used.
4. If `tracesSampler` is not defined and there's no parent sampling decision, `tracesSampleRate` will be used.

<Alert title="Note" level="info">
<markdown>

Transactions should be sampled only by `tracesSampleRate` or `tracesSampler`. The `sampleRate` configuration is used for error events and should not apply to transactions.

### Sampling Context

If defined, the `tracesSampler` callback should be passed a `samplingContext` object, which should include, at minimum:

- The `transactionContext` with which the transaction was created
- A boolean `parentSampled` which contains the sampling decision passed down from the parent, if any
- Data from an optional `customSamplingContext` object passed to `startTransaction` when it is called manually

Depending on the platform, other default data may be included. (For example, for server frameworks, it makes sense to include the `request` object corresponding to the request the transaction is measuring.)

### Propagation

A transaction's sampling decision should be passed to all of its children, including across service boundaries. This can be accomplished in the `startChild` method for same-service children and using the `senry-trace` header for children in a different service.

## Header `sentry-trace`

The header is used for trace propagation. SDKs use the header to continue traces from upstream services (incoming HTTP requests), and to propagate tracing information to downstream services (outgoing HTTP requests).

`sentry-trace = traceid-spanid-sampled`

`sampled` is optional. So at a minimum, it's expected:

`sentry-trace = traceid-spanid`

To offer a minimal compatibility with the [W3C `traceparent` header](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/#traceparent-header) (without the version prefix) and [Zipkin's `b3` headers](https://zipkin.io/pages/instrumenting#communicating-trace-information) (which consider both 64 and 128 bits for `traceId` valid), the `sentry-trace` header should have a `traceId` of 128 bits encoded in 32 hex chars and a `spanId` of 64 bits encoded in 16 hex chars.
To avoid confusion with the W3C `traceparent` header (to which our header is similar but not identical), we call it simply `sentry-trace`.
No version is being defined in the header.

The `sentry-trace` header should only be attached to an outgoing request if the request's URL matches at least one entry of the [`tracePropagationTargets`](#tracepropagationtargets) SDK option.

### The `sampled` Value

To simplify processing, the value consists of a single (optional) character. The possible values are:

```
  - No value means defer

0 - Don't sample

1 - Sampled
```

Unlike with `b3` headers, a `sentry-trace` header should never consist solely of a sampling decision, with no `traceid` or `spanid` values. There are [good reasons](https://github.com/apache/incubator-zipkin-b3-propagation/blob/bc937b6854ea30e46b3e85fbf147d8f4de685dd5/README.md#why-send-trace-ids-with-a-reject-sampling-decision) to always include the `traceid` and `spanid` regardless of the sampling decision, and doing so also simplifies implementation.

Besides the [usual reasons to use \*defer](https://github.com/apache/incubator-zipkin-b3-propagation/blob/bc937b6854ea30e46b3e85fbf147d8f4de685dd5/README.md#why-defer-a-sampling-decision),\* in the case of Sentry, a reason would be if a downstream system captures an error event with Sentry. The decision could be done at that point to sample that trace in order to have tracing data available for the reported crash.

`sentry-trace = sampled`

Which in reality is useful for proxies to set it to `0` and opt out of tracing.

## Static API Changes

The `Sentry.startTransaction` function should take two arguments - the `transactionContext` passed to the `Transaction` constructor and an optional `customSamplingContext` object containing data to be passed to `tracesSampler` (if defined).

It creates a `Transaction` bound to the current hub and returns the instance.
Users interact with the instance for creating child spans and, thus, have to
keep track of it themselves.

## `Hub` Changes

- Introduce a method called `traceHeaders`

  - This function returns a header (string) `sentry-trace`
  - The value should be the trace header string of the `Span` that is currently on the `Scope`

- Introduce a method called `startTransaction`

  - Takes the same two arguments as `Sentry.startTransaction`
  - Creates a new `Transaction` instance
  - Should implement sampling as described in more detail in the 'Sampling' section of this document

- Modify the method called `captureEvent` or `captureTransaction`
  - Don't set `lastEventId` for transactions

<!--
NOTE: we may omit this as a deprecated API replaced by `startTransaction` and
`transaction.startChild`, or embrace it as a shortcut for creating a span that
is the child of an existing transaction in the current scope or otherwise an
orphan span (that will not be sent to Sentry on its own).

- `Hub` → Introduce a method called `startSpan`
    - Creates a new `Span` instance
    - If there is already a `Span` on the current `Scope`, the created `Span`
      should be its child
-->

## `Scope` Changes

The `Scope` holds a reference to the current `Span` or `Transaction`.

<!--
TODO: as of writing, the reference in the scope is only done for automatically
instrumented transactions and spans. It is yet-to-be-specified whether this
behavior applies to manual instrumentation as well.
-->

- `Scope` Introduce `setSpan`
  - This can be used internally to pass a `Span` / `Transaction` around so
    that integrations can attach children to it
  - Setting the `transaction` property on the `Scope` (legacy) should
    overwrite the name of the `Transaction` stored in the `Scope`, if there is
    one. With that we give users the option to change the transaction name
    even if they don't have access to the instance of the `Transaction`
    directly.

## Interaction with `beforeSend` and Event Processors

The `beforeSend` callback is a special Event Processor that we consider to be of
most prominent use. Proper Event Processors are often considered internal.

Transactions should **not** go through `beforeSend`. However, they are still
processed by Event Processors. This is a compromise between some flexibility in
dealing with the current implementation of transactions as events, and
leaving room for different lifetime hooks for transactions and spans.

Motivations:

1. Future-proofing: if users rely on `beforeSend` for transactions, that would
   complicate eventually implementing individual span ingestion without breaking
   user code. As of writing, a transaction is sent as an event, but that is
   considered an implementation detail.

2. API compatibility: users have their existing implementation of `beforeSend`
   that only ever had to deal with error events. We introduced transactions as a
   new type of event. As users upgrade to a new SDK version and start using
   tracing, their `beforeSend` would start seeing a new type that their code was
   not meant to handle. Before transactions, they didn't have to care about
   different event types at all. There are several possible consequences:
   breaking user apps; silently and unintentionally dropping transactions;
   transaction events modified in surprising ways.

3. In terms of usability, `beforeSend` is not a perfect fit for dropping
   transactions like it is for dropping errors. Errors are a point-in-time
   event. When errors happen, users have full context in `beforeSend` and can
   modify/drop the event before it goes to Sentry. With transactions the flow is
   different. Transactions are created and then they are open for some time
   while child spans are created and appended to it. Meanwhile outgoing HTTP
   requests include the sampling decision of the current transaction with other
   services. After spans and the transaction are finished, dropping the
   transaction in a `beforeSend`-like hook would leave orphan transactions from
   other services in a trace. Similarly, modifying the sampling decision to
   "yes" at this late stage would also produce inconsistent traces.
