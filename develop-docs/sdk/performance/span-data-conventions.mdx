title: 'Span Data Conventions'
---

The Span Interface specifies a series of _timed_ application events that have a start and end time. Below describes the conventions for the Span interface for the `data` field on the span.

The `data` field on the span is expected to follow [OpenTelemetry's semantic conventions for attributes](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/24de67b3827a4e3ab2515cd8ab62d5bcf837c586/specification/trace/semantic_conventions/README.md) as much as possible.

Keys on the `data` field should be lower-case and use underscores instead of camel-case. There are some exceptions to this, but these exist because of backwards compatability.

Below describes the conventions for the Span interface for the `data` field on the span that are currently used by the product or are important to bring up.
