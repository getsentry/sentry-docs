## Check-In Payload

A check-in is an item in an envelope called `check_in`. It consists
of a JSON payload that looks roughly like this:

```json
{
  "check_in_id": "83a7c03ed0a04e1b97e2e3b18d38f244",
  "monitor_slug": "b7645b8e-b47d-4398-be9a-d16b0dac31cb",
  "status": "in_progress",
  "duration": 10.0,
  "release": "1.0.0",
  "environment": "production"
}
```
The following fields exist:

`check_in_id`

: **String, required**. Check-In ID (unique and client generated).

`monitor_slug`

: **String, required**. The distinct slug of the monitor.

`status`

: **String, required**. The status of the check-in. Can be one of the following:
  - `in_progress`: The check-in has started.
  - `ok`: The check-in has completed successfully.
  - `error`: The check-in has failed.

`duration`

: _Number, optional_. The duration of the check-in in seconds. Will only take effect if the
  status is `ok` or `error`.
