## Cron Monitor Check-In Payload

A check-in is an item in an envelope called `check_in`. It consists
of a JSON payload that looks roughly like this:

```json
{
  "check_in_id": "83a7c03ed0a04e1b97e2e3b18d38f244",
  "monitor_slug": "my-monitor",
  "status": "in_progress",
  "duration": 10.0,
  "release": "1.0.0",
  "environment": "production",
  "contexts": {
    "trace": {
      "trace_id": "8f431b7aa08441bbbd5a0100fd91f9fe"
    }
  }
}
```
The following fields exist:

`check_in_id`

: **String, required**. Check-In ID (unique and client generated).

  This may be provided as a empty UUID (128 bit zero value) to indicate to
  Sentry that the checkin should update the most recent "in_progress" check-in.
  If the most recent check-in is not in progress a new one will be created
  instead.

`monitor_slug`

: **String, required**. The distinct slug of the monitor.

`status`

: **String, required**. The status of the check-in. Can be one of the following:
  - `in_progress`: The check-in has started.
  - `ok`: The check-in has completed successfully.
  - `error`: The check-in has failed.

`duration`

: _Number, optional_. The duration of the check-in in seconds. Will only take effect if the
  status is `ok` or `error`.

`release`

: _String, optional_. The release.

`environment`

: _String, optional_. The environment.

`monitor_config`

: _Object, optional_. A monitor configuration (defined below) that is stored with the
 check-in in order to verify the state of the monitor at the time of the check-in.

`contexts`

: _Object, optional_. A dictionary of contextual information about the environment running
 the check-in. Right now we only support the [trace context](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/event-payloads/contexts/#trace-context)
  and use the `trace_id` in order to link check-ins to associated errors.

## Monitor upsert support

In addition to sending check-in details, the SDK may also provide monitor
configuration, allowing monitors to be created or updated when sending
check-ins.


```json
{
  "check_in_id": "83a7c03ed0a04e1b97e2e3b18d38f244",
  "monitor_slug": "b7645b8e-b47d-4398-be9a-d16b0dac31cb",
  "status": "in_progress",
  "monitor_config": {
    "schedule": {
      "type": "crontab",
      "value": "0 * * * *"
    },
    "checkin_margin": 5,
    "max_runtime": 30,
    "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles"
  }
}
```
The following fields exist under the `monitor_config` key:

`schedule`

: **Object, required**. [See schedule configuration](#schedule-configuration).

`checkin_margin`

: _Number, optional_. The allowed allowed margin of minutes after the expected
check-in time that the monitor will not be considered missed for.

`max_runtime`

: _Number, optional_. The allowed allowed duration in minutes that the monitor
may be `in_progress` for before being considered failed due to timeout.

`timezone`

: _String, optional_. A [`tz
database`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) string
representing the timezone which the monitor's execution schedule is in.

### Schedule configuration

<Note>
This configuration format differs slightly from what is accepted in the
monitors frontend APIs.
</Note>

`type`

: **String, required**. One of `crontab` or `interval`.

#### Using `crontab`

`value`

: **String, required**. The crontab schedule string, e.g. `0 * * * *`.

#### Using `interval`

`value`

: **Number, required**. The interval value.

`unit`

: **String, required**. The interval unit. Should be one of `year`, `month`, `week`, `day`, `hour`, `minute`.
