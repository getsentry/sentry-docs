## Scope and Intent


Client reports are a protocol feature that let clients send status reports
about themselves to Sentry.  They are currently mainly used to emit outcomes
for events that were never sent.  Chained relays are also able to emit these
client reports to inform the next relay in chain about _some_ outcomes.

Due to a bug in Relay, which discards envelopes containing unknown envelope
items, the minimum required version of Sentry for client reports is 
[21.9.0](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#2190).

Before client reports were added there were no insights into the full number of events generated within applications instrumented with Sentry SDKs. It was always clear to track the number of events dropped on Sentry server side for any number of reason, but there was a gap in knowing just how many events were never sent from the SDKs at all. Are there patterns in different platforms? Are there problems we are not aware of? If a customer were to call Sentry and ask where there events are, we would have no answer, and no way to find out if there are truly missing events from their SDKs. Client reports removes some of this doubt. That being said we are not looking to perfectly measure every nuance and edge case of events being discarded in SDKs. It is more important to have a best effort and be able to gain insights to our SDKs and their host applications.

As seen here, we communicate *Accepted*, *filtered* and *dropped*, and now we can send a new type *discarded* (not displayed in product yet).

## Basic Operation

Client reports are sent as envelope items to Sentry, typically as separate
envelopes or with one of the already scheduled envelopes.  They should not
be sent too frequently but not too infrequently either.  Their main purpose
is to bring visibility into what is happening on the SDK side which affects
the user experience.

For instance SDKs might drop events in a few places in the SDK and this loss
of events can be invisible to a customer.  Client reports let an SDK emit
such event outcomes to provide data about how often this is happening.  For
instance SDKs might drop events if the transports hit their maximum internal
queue size, because rate limits instruct the SDK to drop events as they are
over quota etc.

Bugs in our SDKs are out of scope for client reports and are not being tracked
using client reports at the moment.

## Envelope Item Payload

A client report is an item in an envelope called `client_report`. It consists
of a JSON payload that looks roughly like this:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2020-02-07T14:16:00Z",
  "discarded_events": [
    {
      "reason": "queue_overflow",
      "category": "error",
      "quantity": 23
    },
    {
      "reason": "queue_overflow",
      "category": "transaction",
      "quantity": 1321
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that this must be enclosed in an envelope. So the full event looks
something like this:

```json
{}
{"type":"client_report"}
{"timestamp":"..."}
```

The following fields exist:

`timestamp`

: _String | Number, optional_. The timestamp of when the client report was created.
Must be an ISO DateTime string or a UNIX timestamp. If not sent, the server
will assume the current UTC timestamp. In the data model, this is called
`received`.

`discarded_events`

: _List of outcome objects_ {`reason`, `category`, `quantity`}

- `reason`: A string reason that defines why events were lost.
- `category`: The data category for which the discard reason applies. These are the same data categories used for [rate limits](/sdk/rate-limiting/#definitions).
- `quantity`: The number of events which were lost

The following discard reasons are currently defined for `discarded_events`:

- `queue_overflow`: a SDK internal queue (eg: transport queue) overflowed
- `cache_overflow`: an SDK internal cache (eg: offline event cache) overflowed
- `ratelimit_backoff`: the SDK dropped events because an earlier rate limit
  instructed the SDK to back off.
- `network_error`: events were dropped because of network errors and were not retried.
- `sample_rate`: an event was dropped because of the configured sample rate.
- `before_send`: an event was dropped in `before_send`
- `event_processor`: an event was dropped by an event processor; may also be used for ignored exceptions / errors
- `send_error`: an event was dropped because of an error when sending it (eg: 400 response)
- `internal_sdk_error`: an event was dropped due to an internal SDK error (eg: web worker crash)

In case a reason needs to be added,
it also has to be added to the allowlist in [snuba](https://github.com/getsentry/snuba/blob/4e7cfdddcf7b93eacb762bc74ca2461cec9464e5/snuba/datasets/outcomes_processor.py#L24-L34).

Additionally the following discard reasons are reserved but there is no expectation
that SDKs send these under normal operation:

`rate_limited_events`, `filtered_events`, `filtered_sampling_events`

: _List of outcome objects_ {`reason`, `category`, `quantity`}

These function like `discarded_events` but identify events that were rate limited,
filtered or filtered by by dynamic sampling _at a relay_. Client SDKs must never
emit these _unless_ they are operating as a relay.  The reason codes for these
need to match the reason codes that relay would emit directly to Sentry.

## SDK Side Recommendations

The client reports feature doesn't expect 100 percent correct numbers, and it is
acceptable for the SDKs to lose a small number of client reports. The expectation of
this feature is to give the users an approximation of specific outcomes. Of course,
the SDKs should ensure not dropping too many reports. It is not required, for example:
 - to persist the data when an application crashes.
 - to move an envelope item with a client report to the next envelope when the cache for envelopes is full.

SDKs are encouraged to reduce needless communication. They shall not send an envelope
everytime they record a discarded event. The following approaches are recommendations
that can be adjusted if required. The SDKs should keep track of the discard events in
the transport. For applications with a low frequency of envelopes to ingest, such as
mobile or web apps, the SDK shall attach the discarded events to an already scheduled
envelope. We accept the tradeoff that apps rarely sending events will have fewer
client reports. When the SDK schedules envelopes continuously, like on the backend,
the SDK shall either choose to flush the discarded events periodically or attach them
to an already scheduled envelope.

The one who drops an envelope item must record and report it. If the server drops
an envelope item, for example, with the response 429, the client SDK must not record
this as the server already does. Still, the SDK must record lost envelope items
when dropping them itself, for example, caused by an active rate limit. SDKs can put
a simple optional check for HTTP status codes in place where any code `>= 400` except
`429` will be recorded as `network_error`. The client SDKs can assume that client
reports never get rate limited. The server is minimizing the possibility of client
reports getting rate limited, but the SDKs shouldn't worry about this edge case as
this feature is best-effort.

### Configuration

SDKs should provide a way to turn sending of client reports on and off. This option is called `send_client_reports` or `sendClientReports` on SDKs that have already implemented it.

### Legacy Events
For SDKs still sending legacy events instead of envelopes for backward compatibility with
older Sentry servers, the recommendation is to send the client report as a separate
envelope or attach it to pending session envelopes.

### Custom Transports
There is no expectation that such bookkeeping can work transparently for custom transports.
Consequently, it's acceptable if client reports are optional for custom transports.
