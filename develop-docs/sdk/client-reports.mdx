Client reports are a protocol feature that let clients send status reports
about themselves to Sentry.  They are currently mainly used to emit outcomes
for events that were never sent.  Chained relays are also able to emit these
cient reports to inform the next relay in chain about _some_ outcomes.

## Basic Operation

Client reports are sent as envelope items to Sentry, typically as separate
envelopes or with one of the already scheduled envelopes.  They should not
be sent too frequently but not too infrequently either.  Their main purpose
is to bring visibility into what is happening on the SDK side which affects
the user experience.

For instance SDKs might drop events in a few places in the SDK and this loss
of events can be invisible to a customer.  Client reports let an SDK emit
such event outcomes to provide data about how often this is happening.  For
instance SDKs might drop events if the transports hit their maximum internal
queue size, because rate limits instruct the SDK to drop events as they are
over quota etc.

## Envelope Item Payload

A client report is an item in an envelope called `client_report`. It consists
of a JSON payload that looks roughly like this:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2020-02-07T14:16:00Z",
  "discarded_events": [
    {
      "reason": "queue_overflow",
      "category": "error",
      "quantity": 23
    },
    {
      "reason": "queue_overflow",
      "category": "transaction",
      "quantity": 1321
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that this must be enclosed in an envelope. So the full event looks
something like this:

```json
{}
{"type":"client_report"}
{"timestamp":"..."}
```

The following fields exist:

`timestamp`

: _String | Number, optional_. The timestamp of when the client report was created.
Must be an ISO DateTime string or a UNIX timestamp. If not sent, the server
will assume the current UTC timestamp. In the data model, this is called
`received`.

`discarded_events`

: _List of outcome objects_ {`reason`, `category`, `quantity`}

- `reason`: A string reason that defines why events were lost.
- `category`: The data category for which the discard reason applies.
- `quantity`: The number of events which were lost

The following discard reasons are currently defined for `discarded_events`:

- `queue_overflow`: a SDK internal queue (eg: transport queue) overflowed
- `cache_overflow`: an SDK internal cache (eg: offline event cache) overflowed
- `ratelimit_backoff`: the SDK dropped events because an earlier rate limit
  instructed the SDK to back off.
- `network_error`: events were dropped because of network errors and were not retried.
- `sample_rate`: an event was dropped because of the configured sample rate.

Additionally the following discard reasons are reserved but there is no expectation
that SDKs send these under normal operation:

- `before_send`: an event was dropped in `before_send`
- `event_processor`: an event was dropped by an event processor

`rate_limited_events`, `filtered_events`, `filtered_sampling_events`

: _List of outcome objects_ {`reason`, `category`, `quantity`}

These function like `discarded_events` but identify events that were rate limited,
filtered or filtered by by dynamic sampling _at a relay_. Client SDKs must never
emit these _unless_ they are operating as a relay.  The reason codes for these
need to match the reason codes that relay would emit directly to Sentry.

## SDK Side Recommendations

SDKs are encouraged to reduce the total amount of needless communciation.  As
such a recommended approach is to keep track of the counts for the discard
reasons in the transport directly and to periodically flush them out as separate
envelope item or attach it to an already scheduled envelope.  As some SDKs still
send legacy events instead of envelopes for backwards compatibility with older
Sentry servers it would be recommended in such cases to send it as separate envelope
instead or attach it to pending session envelopes.

There is no expectation that such bookkeeping can work transparently for custom
transports which is why it's generally acceptable if client reports are optional
for custom transports.
