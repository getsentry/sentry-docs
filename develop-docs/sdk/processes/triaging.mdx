The term *triage* originally comes from medicine and describes the process of quickly examining patients who are taken to a hospital in order to decide which ones are the most seriously ill and must be treated first.

By *triaging issues*, we are evaluating problems that our customers are facing and providing the appropriate level of support. The goal is to provide attention to all open issues, to categorize them and alert people when there are issues of high severity. The goal is *not* to fix all issues or answer all the questions immediately.

## Getting started

## GitHub

### GitHub Issues

Generally, all new issues opened by users will automatically receive the `Waiting for: Product Owner` label. Whenever a contributor replies to the issue, the label will be removed, and the `Waiting for: Community` label will be applied instead.

If/when a user replies, the `Waiting for: Community` label will be removed and the `Waiting for: Product Owner` label will be applied again (indicating that a response from the repository maintainers is expected).

Note that issues created by maintainers will not get any of these labels applied.

If a user replies to an issue, leading to a change of labels, but no response is required by a contributor, you may also remove the respective label manually.

This labeling is done, because we track our "time to response" on GitHub issues. We do this, because we care about our users getting the answers they need. We strive to answer all user issues within 2 business days.

### GitHub Discussions

Discussions on GitHub should be handled equally to GitHub Issues. Please note, that not all of our SDK repositories have Discussions enabled.
