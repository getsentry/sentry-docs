## Run a Local Relay

You do not need a local Sentry for SDK development but you will want to run a local
[relay](https://docs.sentry.io/product/relay/).  The reason for this is that Sentry's
main ingestion endpoint is not intended for development but for high throughput
production use.  What this means is that a lot of the event processing is happening
after the event has already been accepted by the system so you won't be able to see
errors when sending the HTTP request.

If you haven't used relay yet, have a look at the [getting started](https://docs.sentry.io/product/relay/getting-started/)
docs for relay.  Once installed you will want to turn up the log level in your
`.relay/config.yml` file:

```yaml
logging:
  level: trace
```

Make sure your relay is running whenever you're doing development:

```shell
relay run
```

When sending events just substitute `orgXXX.ingest.sentry.io` with `localhost:3000` or
whichever port you ended up choosing.  Also note that a local relay will out of the box
be available via HTTP only so don't try to send HTTPS requests there.

## Consult Existing SDKs

While we're trying to keep the docs up to date about all important things, it's usually
a good idea to refer to already existing Sentry SDKs for input.  In particular the
transport design is not part of the documentation but generally quite similar between
SDKs.

## Define Conventions and Types Before Shipping

Before shipping new or changed SDK behavior, make sure the relevant definitions exist outside your SDK first:

- **Semantic conventions:** New or changed attributes **MUST** first be defined in [sentry-conventions](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-conventions/). If the convention you need doesn't exist yet, open a PR there to propose it. Only after the convention has been merged should you implement it in an SDK. This ensures all SDKs use consistent naming and semantics.

  The merge process for sentry-conventions PRs:
  1. Open a PR with the proposed convention.
  2. Get an approval from at least one code owner.
  3. Wait at least 3 business days after the first approval to give other code owners a chance to review.

- **Context types:** Any newly added [context](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/foundations/data-model/event-payloads/contexts/) **SHOULD** also be typed out in [Relay](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/tree/master/relay-event-schema/src/protocol/contexts) so that the schema stays in sync with what SDKs emit.

## Join us on Discord

You can reach out to Sentry open source contributors and talk with other SDK maintainers on the [Sentry Discord server](https://discord.gg/sentry).
