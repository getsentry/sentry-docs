This guide goes over the minimal setup needed to publish something via
[`publish`] and [`craft`]. This example will use a PyPI package.

[`publish`]: https://github.com/getsentry/publish
[`craft`]: https://github.com/getsentry/craft

## The First Release

This guide assumes this thing has never been released before and has no
existing tags. If that's not the case feel free to skip this section!

A tag must exist for the "beginning" of the repository due to [a limitation] --
it is recommended to tag the first commit of the repository before any
meaningful history such that the first changelog includes useful context.

```bash
git tag 0.0.0 "$(git log -1 --reverse --format=%h)"
git push origin --tags
```

[a limitation]: https://github.com/getsentry/craft/issues/342

## CI Requirements

First we need to ensure your repository responds to `release/**` branches
and produces an artifact with the right name.

For our example repository that's done using [`push: branches`] and an
[artifact instruction].

[`push: branches`]: https://github.com/getsentry/uwsgi-dogstatsd-plugin/blob/5057cba0104827c226094f153ffba7ade1a4331d/.github/workflows/build.yml#L5
[artifact instruction]: https://github.com/getsentry/uwsgi-dogstatsd-plugin/blob/5057cba0104827c226094f153ffba7ade1a4331d/.github/workflows/build.yml#L81-L84

## Setting Up Craft

### `.craft.yml`

We're just interested in making a GitHub release and a PyPI release so our
`craft` configuration looks like:

```yaml
minVersion: 0.28.1
targets:
  - name: pypi
  - name: github
```

### `scripts/bump-version.sh`

This script will be invoked by `craft` by default when bumping the version.

Since we're specifying version in `setup.cfg` this is pretty easy to do with
`sed` (we're ignoring `$1` which contains the old version):

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euxo pipefail

sed -i "s/^version =.*/version = $2/" setup.cfg
```

Try the script out (but don't commit the changes):

```console
$ ./scripts/bump-version.sh 0.0.0 1.0.0
+ sed -i 's/^version =.*/version = 1.0.0/' setup.cfg
$ git diff | grep '^[-+]'
--- a/setup.cfg
+++ b/setup.cfg
-version = 0.0.0
+version = 1.0.0
$ git checkout -- .
```

Nice!

### `.github/workflows/release.yml`

This file is used to trigger the release from the GitHub UI.

You'll notice it uses `vars.SENTRY_RELEASE_BOT_CLIENT_ID` and `secrets.SENTRY_RELEASE_BOT_PRIVATE_KEY` -- these should be
available to your repository automatically! These are needed because
[GitHub prevents `GITHUB_TOKEN` from triggering downstream workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows),
which is required for creating publish request issues in `getsentry/publish`.

```yaml
name: Release

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      version:
        description: Version to release
        required: false
      force:
        description: Force a release even when there are release-blockers (optional)
        required: false

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: "Release a new version"
    steps:
      - name: Get auth token
        id: token
        uses: actions/create-github-app-token@5d869da34e18e7287c1daad50e0b8ea0f506ce69 # v1.11.0
        with:
          app-id: ${{ vars.SENTRY_RELEASE_BOT_CLIENT_ID }}
          private-key: ${{ secrets.SENTRY_RELEASE_BOT_PRIVATE_KEY }}
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6
        with:
          token: ${{ steps.token.outputs.token }}
          fetch-depth: 0
      - name: Prepare release
        uses: getsentry/craft@v2
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ steps.token.outputs.token }}
        with:
          version: ${{ github.event.inputs.version }}
          force: ${{ github.event.inputs.force }}
```

For full details on all available options including auto-versioning, changelog preview,
and more, see [Craft's GitHub Actions documentation](https://craft.sentry.dev/github-actions/).
If your repository is outside the `getsentry` organization, you can use the simpler
[reusable workflow](https://craft.sentry.dev/github-actions/#option-1-reusable-workflow-recommended)
which handles token management automatically via `secrets: inherit`.

### Commit + PR

**Commit those three files and make a pull request.**

## Setting Up Permissions

Give the following teams access to your repository:

- `engineering` -> `write`

You can do this self-service via the settings page of your repository:
`https://github.com/getsentry/REPONAME_HERE/settings/access`

## Create Ruleset for the Repo

Download and save the [default ruleset template](/json/Default_ruleset.json) as a JSON file.

Visit the ruleset setting page of your repository: `https://github.com/getsentry/REPONAME_HERE/settings/rules`, click on the green **New ruleset** button, choose **Import a ruleset**, and select the JSON file you just downloaded. You can tweak the ruleset settings, but please don't remove the App in the Bypass List.

## Making Your First Release!

Navigate to the actions tab of your repository, locate the release workflow,
and create the first release! I used `1.0.0` as the first version.

This will create an [issue in `publish`] which you'll need an approver to
add a label to.

[issue in `publish`]: https://github.com/getsentry/publish/issues

## Calendar Versioning (CalVer)

To enable calendar versioning for your SDK, add the following to your `.craft.yml`:

```yaml
versioning:
  policy: calver
  calver:
    format: "%y.%-m" # e.g., 24.12 for December 2024
    offset: 14 # Days to look back for date calculation (optional)
```

See the [Craft CalVer documentation](https://craft.sentry.dev/configuration/#calendar-versioning-calver) for more details.

## Merge Target

By default, all releases are merged to the default branch of your repository (usually `main`). To override this, pass the `merge_target` input in your release workflow:

```yaml
- name: Prepare release
  uses: getsentry/craft@v2
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ steps.token.outputs.token }}
  with:
    version: ${{ github.event.inputs.version }}
    merge_target: ${{ github.event.inputs.merge_target }}
```

Make sure to also add a `merge_target` input to your workflow's `workflow_dispatch.inputs` block.
The same input is available in the [reusable workflow](https://craft.sentry.dev/github-actions/#option-1-reusable-workflow-recommended) as well.

## Version name conventions

To keep versioning consistent across SDKs, we generally follow [semantic versioning (semver)](https://semver.org/), with language- or platform-specific conventions around semver (if applicable).
Craft has some precautionary checks to ensure we only publish valid, semver-like versions.
Specifically, craft expects versions following this format:

```txt
<major>.<minor>.<patch>(-<prerelease>)?(-<build>)?
```

While the major, minor and patch version numbers are required, pre-release and build properties are optional but can also be combined.

### Pre-releases (`<prerelease>`)

If you want to create a preview or pre-release of your SDK, you can append a pre-release identifier, as well as an optional incremental pre-release number to your version.
This will ensure that various craft publishing targets will treat the release as a pre-release, meaning for example that it will not get assigned a `latest` tag in package repositories.
Likewise, pre-releases will not be inserted into our internal release-registry, which is used by the Sentry product as well as our docs and other tools to query the latest or specific releases of our packages.

Importantly, we have strict rules around which identifiers we accept as a pre-release, meaning the `<prerelease>` part of your version has to be one of the following: `preview|pre|rc|dev|alpha|beta|unstable|a|b`.
Therefore, we **do not accept** arbitrary strings as pre-release identifiers. Using any other identifiers will result in a release being considered stable instead. This means, it will get assigned a `latest` tag in package repositories and inserted into our release-registry.

Examples:

```txt
// valid
1.0.0-preview
1.0.0-alpha.0
1.0.0-beta.1
1.0.0-rc.20
1.0.0-a

// invalid or incorrectly treated
1.0.0-foo
1.0.0-canary.0
```

#### Special Case: Post Releases

Python has the concept of post releases, which craft handles implicitly. A post release is indicated by a `-\d+` suffix to the semver version, for example: `1.0.0-1`.
Given that we only consider certain identifiers as [valid pre-release identifiers](#pre-releases-prerelease), post releases are considered stable releases.

### Build identifiers (`<build>`)

In some cases, you can append a build identifier to your version, for example if you release the same package version for different platforms or architectures.
You can also combine build and pre-release identifiers but in this case, the pre-release identifier has to come first.

Examples:

```txt
// valid
1.0.0+x86_64
1.0.0-rc.1+x86_64

// invalid or incorrectly treated
1.0.0+rc.1+x86_64
1.0.0+x86_64-beta.0
```

## [Optional] Using Multiple Craft Configs in a Repo

In some cases, we need to maintain multiple or diverging publishing configs in a repository.
For example, when we have to maintain multiple major versions of a package we release (e.g. Sentry JavaScript SDK v7 and v8), where we added or removed artifacts or publishing targets.

By default, our publishing process is configured to take the `craft.yml` config from the repo's default branch as the single source of truth for publishing.

You can opt your repo into using the config from a specific merge target branch (can be configured when triggering the Prepare Release Action) in two steps:

### 1. Release Preparation:

Add `craft_config_from_merge_target: true` when calling `getsentry/craft` in your repo's release workflow:

```yml
# ...
jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: "Release a new version"
    steps:
      # ...
      - name: Prepare release
        uses: getsentry/craft@v2
        with:
          # ...
          craft_config_from_merge_target: true
```

This input is also available in the [reusable workflow](https://craft.sentry.dev/github-actions/#option-1-reusable-workflow-recommended).

### 2. Publish Configuration

Add the branch(es) you want to take the config from to the `publish.yml` workflow in `getsentry/publish`:

```yml
# ...
- name: Set target repo checkout branch
  if: |
    fromJSON(steps.inputs.outputs.result).repo == 'sentry-javascript' && fromJSON(steps.inputs.outputs.result).merge_target == 'v7'
```

Note: The branch(es) registered in this step **MUST BE** protected in the target repository.
Disable direct pushing to the branch and require approvals for PRs before they can be merged.

Good job! Now you can let your craft configs diverge across the different merge target branches and the publishing process will pick up the correct config based on the branch you're setting as a merge target.
