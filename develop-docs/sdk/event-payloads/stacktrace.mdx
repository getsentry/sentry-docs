title: Stack Trace Interface
sidebar_order: 4
---

A stack trace contains a list of frames, each with various bits (most optional)
describing the context of that frame. Frames should be sorted from oldest to
newest.

<Note><markdown>

Stack traces are always part of an exception or a thread. They cannot be
declared as a top-level event property. When adding a stack trace to an event,
follow this rule of thumb:

- If the stack trace is part of an error, exception or crash, add it to the [Exception Interface](/sdk/event-payloads/exception/).
- Otherwise, add it as a thread in the [Threads Interface](/sdk/event-payloads/threads/).

## Attributes

`frames`

: **Required**. A non-empty list of stack frames (see below). The list is
ordered from caller to callee, or oldest to youngest. The last frame is the
one creating the exception.

`registers`

: _Optional_. A map of register names and their values. The values should
contain the actual register values of the thread, thus mapping to the last
frame in the list.

## Frame Attributes

Each object should contain **at least** a `filename`, `function` or
`instruction_addr` attribute. All values are optional, but recommended.

`filename`

: The path to the source file relative to the project root directory.

The value should not make file names indistinguishable and should only change
between releases for files that were actually renamed.

In some SDKs, this is implemented as the path relative to a certain entry
point relevant to the language/platform. For example, in Python the `filename`
is relative to `PYTHONPATH` or `site-packages`.

`function`

: The name of the function being called.

This function name may be shortened or demangled. If not, Sentry will demangle
and shorten it. The original function name will be stored in `raw_function`.

`raw_function`

: The original function name, if the function name is shortened or demangled.
Sentry shows the raw function when clicking on the shortened one in the UI.

`module`

: Platform-specific module path (e.g. `sentry.interfaces.Stacktrace`).

`lineno`

: The line number of the call, starting at 1.

`colno`

: The column number of the call, starting at 1.

`abs_path`

: The absolute path to the source file.

`context_line`

: Source code in filename at `lineno`.

`pre_context`

: A list of source code lines before `context_line` (in order) – usually
`[lineno - 5:lineno]`.

`post_context`

: A list of source code lines after `context_line` (in order) – usually
`[lineno + 1:lineno + 5]`.

`in_app`

: Signals whether this frame is related to the execution of the relevant code
in this stack trace. For example, the frames that might power the framework’s
web server of your app are probably not relevant. However, calls to the
framework’s library once you start handling code likely are relevant.

`vars`

: A mapping of variables which were available within this frame (usually
context-locals).

The following attributes are primarily used for C-based languages:

`instruction_addr`

: An optional instruction address for symbolication. This should be a string
with a hexadecimal number that includes a `0x` prefix. If this is set and a
known image is defined in the [Debug Meta Interface](/sdk/event-payloads/debugmeta/), then
symbolication can take place.  Note that the `addr_mode` attribute can
control the behavior of this address.

`addr_mode`

: Optionally changes the addressing mode.  The default value is the same as `"abs"`
which means absolute referencing.  This can also be set to `"rel:DEBUG_ID"` or
`"rel:IMAGE_INDEX"` to make addresses relative to an object referenced by debug id
or index.  This for instance is necessary for WASM processing as WASM does not use
a unified address space.

`symbol_addr`

: An optional address that points to a symbol. We use the instruction
address for symbolication, but this can be used to calculate an instruction
offset automatically.  Note that the `addr_mode` attribute can
control the behavior of this address.

`image_addr`

: Optionally an address of the debug image to reference.

`package`

: The "package" the frame was contained in. Depending on the platform, this can
be different things. For C#, it can be the name of the assembly. For native
code, it can be the path of the dynamic library, etc.

`platform`

: This can override the platform for a single frame. Otherwise, the platform of
the event is assumed. This can be used for multi-platform stack traces, such
as in React Native.

## Examples

For the given example program written in Python:

```python
def foo():
  my_var = 'foo'
  raise ValueError()

def main():
  foo()
```

A minimalistic stack trace for the above program in the correct order:

```json
{
  "frames": [{ "function": "main" }, { "function": "foo" }]
}
```

The top frame fully populated with five lines of source context:

```json
{
  "frames": [
    {
      "in_app": true,
      "function": "myfunction",
      "abs_path": "/real/file/name.py",
      "filename": "file/name.py",
      "lineno": 3,
      "vars": {
        "my_var": "'value'"
      },
      "pre_context": ["def foo():", "  my_var = 'foo'"],
      "context_line": "  raise ValueError()",
      "post_context": ["", "def main():"]
    }
  ]
}
```

A minimal native stack trace with register values. Note that the `package` event
attribute must be `"native"` for these frames to be symbolicated.

```json
{
  "frames": [
    { "instruction_addr": "0x7fff5bf3456c" },
    { "instruction_addr": "0x7fff5bf346c0" }
  ],
  "registers": {
    "rip": "0x00007ff6eef54be2",
    "rsp": "0x0000003b710cd9e0"
  }
}
```
