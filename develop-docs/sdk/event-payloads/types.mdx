title: Event Type Definitions
---

This page documents the event schema for errors, just like the other documents
at <Link to="/sdk/event-payloads/">Event Payloads</Link> do. However, the
sections here are automatically generated from code, and because of that they
are more complete and less out of date. We intend to make this page the single
source of truth and replace all the other "interface" pages, but there is still
some work to be done to make this more human-readable.

Go to [our schemas repo](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-data-schemas) to
learn more.
