title: Contexts Interface
sidebar_order: 9
---

The Contexts Interface provides additional context data. Typically, this is data
related to the current user and the environment. For example, the device or
application version. Its canonical name is `contexts`.

The `contexts` type can be used to define arbitrary contextual data on the
event. It accepts an object of key/value pairs. The key is the “alias” of the
context and can be freely chosen. However, as per policy, it should match the
type of the context unless there are two values for a type. You can omit `type`
if the key name is the type.

When adding additional data to the event data model contexts are a good fit when
you have all the data available at a single point in time. Contexts are not well
suited to data that is collected over time as the SDK interfaces for contexts
don't afford merging of data.

Unknown data for the contexts is rendered as a key/value list.

In the Sentry Product, certain contexts are rendered in a special way to make it more readable. More details about this can be found in the [contexts code on the Sentry UI](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/tree/master/static/app/components/events/contexts).

For more details about sending additional data with your event, see the [full documentation on Additional Data](https://docs.sentry.io/platform-redirect/?next=/enriching-events/context/).

## Device Context

Device context describes the device that caused the event. This is most
appropriate for mobile applications.

The `type` and default key is `"device"`.

`name`

: **Required**. The name of the device. This is typically a hostname.

`family`

: _Optional_. The family of the device. This is usually the common part of model
names across generations. For instance, `iPhone` would be a reasonable family,
so would be `Samsung Galaxy`.

## OS Context

OS context under the default key `"os"` describes the operating system on which
the crash happened/the event was created.

The `type` and default key is `"os"`. However, since contexts can be set
multiple times under different keys, there has historically been a lot of
confusion about which OS context represents what. So here's some examples:

- In events reported from a Python/ASP.NET/Rails web backend, the OS context
  under the default key `"os"` is the server's operating system, and is set by
  the SDK (if at all).

  Additionally, the Sentry server will attempt to parse the `User-Agent` header
  from the event's [Request Interface](/sdk/event-payloads/request/) and create a _secondary_ OS
  context under the non-default key `"client_os"`.

- In events reported from a JS web frontend, the SDK typically reports no OS
  context.

  The server however knows by looking at the platform (`"javascript"`) that the
  incoming User-Agent can only come from the crashing device, and creates the
  User-Agent based OS context under the default key `"os"`.

To summarize:

- `"os"` key for the device generating the event.
- `"client_os"` key for an adjacent client device's OS (that is _not_ the
  device creating the event) if it's important. The Sentry server sets this as part of
  User-Agent parsing, but SDKs can set this directly too.
- If in doubt, just send `"os"`. Any other keys are not searchable in the
  product and will not be visually pronounced using icons, so using something
  like `"server_os"` to clarify what you meant is probably going to
  backfire with regards to the overall product experience.

  Under the existing mental model, a hypothetical `"server_os"` key would
  actually mean you're reporting the operating system of an adjacent "upstream"
  device that the crashing device is talking to.

  As Kurt Tucholsky said: "The opposite of good is not evil, but good intentions"

`name`

: _Recommended_. The name of the operating system. It might be derived from `raw_description`. It is **required** if `raw_description` is not provided.

`version`

: _Optional_. The version of the operating system.

`build`

`theme`

: _Optional_. Either `light` or `dark`. Describes whether the OS runs in dark mode or not.

`raw_description`

system. For some well-known runtimes, Sentry will attempt to parse `name` and
`version` from this string, if they are not explicitly given.

### Example OS Context

The OS Context for the 3 major OSs should look like this:

```json

## Replay Context

Replay context contains the replay_id of the associated replay with the event.

The only and required field is `replay_id`.

This should not be sent by SDKs in most cases, as the Dynamic Sampling Context will be plucked in relay, 
but for current versions of python and PHP these SDKs will send this context as they do not currently support the 
envelope endpoint.

`replay_id`

: **Required**. The replay_id associated with the event.

### Example Replay Context

```json
{
  "contexts": {
    "replay": {
      "replay_id": "12312012123120121231201212312012"
  }
}
```
