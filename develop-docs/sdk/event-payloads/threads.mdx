title: Threads Interface
sidebar_order: 10
---

The Threads Interface specifies threads that were running at the time an event
happened. These threads can also contain stack traces.

An [event](/sdk/event-payloads/) may contain one or more threads in an attribute named `threads`.

The `threads` attribute should be an object with the attribute `values`
containing one or more values that are objects in the format described below.
Alternatively, the `threads` attribute may be a flat list of objects in the format below.

As per Sentry policy, the thread that crashed with an [exception](/sdk/event-payloads/exception/) should not
have a stack trace, but instead, the `thread_id` attribute should be set on the
exception and Sentry will connect the two.

## Attributes

`id`

: **Required**. The ID of the thread. Typically a number or numeric string.
Needs to be unique among the threads. An exception can set the `thread_id`
attribute to cross-reference this thread.

`crashed`

: _Optional_. A flag indicating whether the thread was the cause for the event being sent, e.g. due to a crash.
Defaults to `false`.

`current`

: _Optional_. A flag indicating whether the thread was in the foreground. A thread is in foreground when it's executing.
Defaults to `false`.

`main`

: _Optional_. If applicable, a flag indicating whether the thread was responsible for rendering the user interface.
On mobile platforms this is oftentimes referred to as the "main thread" or "ui thread".

`name`

: _Optional_. The thread name.

`state`

: _Optional_. State of the thread at the time of the event.

`stacktrace`

: _Optional_. A stack trace object corresponding to the [Stack Trace Interface](/sdk/event-payloads/stacktrace/).

If this is an error event, the stack trace of the main exception should be
declared in the [Exception Interface](/sdk/event-payloads/exception/) instead.
Sentry will automatically move the stack trace of the only crashed thread, if
there is a single exception.

## Examples

The following example illustrates the threads part of the [event payload](/sdk/event-payloads/) and omits
other attributes for simplicity.

```json
{
  "threads": {
    "values": [
      {
        "id": "0",
        "name": "main",
        "crashed": true,
        "stacktrace": {}
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Or, alternatively:

```json
{
  "threads": [
    {
      "id": "0",
      "name": "main",
      "crashed": true,
      "stacktrace": {}
    }
  ]
}
```
