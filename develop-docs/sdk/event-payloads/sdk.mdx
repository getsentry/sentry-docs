The SDK Interface describes the Sentry SDK and its configuration used to capture
and transmit an event.

## Attributes

`name`

: **Required**. The name of the SDK. The format is `entity.ecosystem[.flavor]`
where _entity_ identifies the developer of the SDK, _ecosystem_ refers to the
programming language or platform where the SDK is to be used and the optional
_flavor_ is used to identify standalone SDKs that are part of a major
ecosystem. Official Sentry SDKs use the _entity_ `sentry`. Examples:

- `sentry.python`
- `sentry.javascript.react-native`

For SDKs that are composed of more than one Sentry SDK. For example, [the Unity SDK](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-unity/issues/616)
which includes a .NET layer as well as different native layers. When events come out
of the native layer, it's important to distinguish from the stand-alone native SDK.
We do that by appending the top SDK to the end of the native SDK name. Examples:

Unity SDK:

- `sentry.dotnet.unity` on events coming from C#. As based on the spec above.
  - `sentry.java.android.unity` on for events of the Java layer on Android
  - `sentry.native.android.unity` on for events of the Native layer on Android
  - `sentry.cocoa.unity` on for events from iOS/macOS layer
  - `sentry.native.unity` on for events coming from `sentry.native` directly. Such as on Windows and Linux.

Android SDK

- `sentry.java.android` on events from the Java layer. Since the Android SDK is based on the Java SDK.
- `sentry.native.android` on events from NDK. It's `sentry.native` but it's bundled in the Android SDK with some customization.

`version`

: **Required**. The version of the SDK. It should have the [Semantic
Versioning](https://semver.org) format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, without any prefix
(no `v` or anything else in front of the major version number). Examples:

- `0.1.0`
- `1.0.0`
- `4.3.12`

`integrations`

: _Optional_. A list of names identifying enabled integrations. The list should
have all enabled integrations, including default integrations. Default
integrations are included because different SDK releases may contain different
default integrations.

`features`

: _Optional_. A list of feature names identifying enabled SDK features. This list
should contain all enabled SDK features. On some SDKs, enabling a feature in the
options also adds an integration. We encourage tracking such features with either
integrations or features but not both to reduce the payload size.

`packages`

: _Optional_. A list of packages that were installed as part of this SDK or the
activated integrations. Each package consists of a `name` in the format
`source:identifier` and `version`. If the source is a Git repository, the source should be `git`, the
`identifier` should be a checkout link and the `version` should be a Git
reference (branch, tag or SHA).

## Example

The following example illustrates the SDK part of the <Link to="/sdk/event-payloads/">event payload</Link> and omits other
attributes for simplicity.

```json
{
  "sdk": {
    "name": "sentry.javascript.react-native",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "integrations": ["redux"],
    "features": ["capture_failed_requests"],
    "packages": [
      {
        "name": "npm:@sentry/react-native",
        "version": "0.39.0"
      },
      {
        "name": "git:https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa.git",
        "version": "4.1.0"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
