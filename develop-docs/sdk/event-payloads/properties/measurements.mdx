`measurements`

: _Optional_. An object containing standard/custom measurements with keys signifying the name of the measurement.

Standard measurement keys currently supported are from the following list taken from [here](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/blob/a8c960a933d2ded5225841573d8fc426a482ca9c/static/app/utils/discover/fields.tsx#L654-L676).

```json
[
  // web
  "fp",
  "fcp",
  "lcp",
  "fid",
  "cls",
  "ttfb",
  "ttfb.requesttime",
  // mobile
  "app_start_cold",
  "app_start_warm",
  "frames_total",
  "frames_slow",
  "frames_frozen",
  // react native
  "stall_count",
  "stall_total_time",
  "stall_longest_time"
]
```

Custom measurements need units to be specified. Units currently supported are durations from the list `["ns" , "ms" , "s"]` taken from [here](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/blob/1e45a8817e45408ecbdbd3f0a679a5f5e4885290/relay-metrics/src/protocol.rs#L14-L21). Note that in the future we will extend the available units (for instance, memory units) but we will not implement a generic user-defined unit interface.


```json
{
  "measurements": {
    "lcp": { "value": 100 },
    "fp": { "value": 123 },
    "my.custom.metric": { "value": 456, "unit": "ms" }
  }
}
```
