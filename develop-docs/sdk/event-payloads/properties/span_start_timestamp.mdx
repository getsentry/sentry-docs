`start_timestamp`

: _Required_. A timestamp representing when the measuring started. The
  format is either a string as defined in [RFC
  3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) or a numeric (integer or float)
  value representing the number of seconds that have elapsed since the [Unix
  epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). The `start_timestamp` value must be less than or
  equal to the `timestamp` value, otherwise the Span is discarded as invalid.

  ```json
  {
    "start_timestamp": "2011-05-02T17:41:36.242Z"
  }
  ```

or: 

  ```json
  {
    "start_timestamp": 1304358096.242
  }
  ```
