title: Event Payloads
---

Events are the fundamental data that clients, often through the use of an SDK, send
to the Sentry server. Event payload size limit is 1 MiB.

The API endpoint on the Sentry server where event payloads are sent is
`/api/{PROJECT_ID}/store/`.

<Alert title="Note on backwards compatibility" level="info"><markdown>

We strive to document the canonical format of an event and its additional
interfaces. However, for backwards compatibility the server also
understands events that are not in the canonical format described throughout the
documentation.

Existing SDKs may be using a historical format that is not recommended for new
code.

If documentation is lacking or outdated, please let us know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/getsentry/develop/issues/new).

SDK developers might benefit from consulting the [source code defining the protocol as understood by the server](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/tree/master/relay-general/src/protocol).

## Required Attributes

Attributes are simple data that Sentry understands to provide the most basic
information about events. These are things like the unique ID of an event or the
time when it occurred.

The following attributes are required for all events.

import "./properties/event_id.mdx"

`timestamp`

: Indicates when the event was created in the Sentry SDK. The format is either a
string as defined in [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) or a
numeric (integer or float) value representing the [number of seconds that have
elapsed since the Unix epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2011-05-02T17:41:36Z"
}
```

or:

```json
{
  "timestamp": 1304358096.0
}
```

`platform`

: A string representing the platform the SDK is submitting from. This will be
used by the Sentry interface to customize various components in the interface.

```json
{
  "platform": "python"
}
```

Acceptable values are:

- `as3`
- `c`
- `cfml`
- `cocoa`
- `csharp`
- `elixir`
- `haskell`
- `go`
- `groovy`
- `java`
- `javascript`
- `native`
- `node`
- `objc`
- `other`
- `perl`
- `php`
- `python`
- `ruby`

## Optional Attributes

Additionally, there are several optional values which Sentry recognizes and are
highly encouraged:

`level`

: The record severity.

Defaults to `error`.

The value needs to be one on the supported level string values.

```json
{
  "level": "warning"
}
```

Acceptable values are:

- `fatal`
- `error`
- `warning`
- `info`
- `debug`

`logger`

: The name of the logger which created the record.

```json
{
  "logger": "my.logger.name"
}
```

`transaction`

: The name of the transaction which caused this exception.

For example, in a web app, this might be the route name.

```json
{
  "transaction": "/users/<username>/"
}
```

`server_name`

: Identifies the host from which the event was recorded.

```json
{
  "server_name": "foo.example.com"
}
```

`release`

: The release version of the application.

**Release versions must be unique across all projects in your organization**.
This value can be the git SHA for the given project, or a product identifier
with a semantic version (suggested format `my-project-name@1.0.0`).

```json
{
  "release": "my-project-name@1.0.0"
}
```

```json
{
  "release": "721e41770371db95eee98ca2707686226b993eda"
}
```

`dist`

: The distribution of the application.

Distributions are used to disambiguate build or deployment variants of the
same release of an application. For example, the dist can be the build number
of an Xcode build or the version code of an Android build.

```json
{
  "release": "721e41770371db95eee98ca2707686226b993eda",
  "dist": "14G60"
}
```

import "./properties/tags.mdx"

`environment`

: The environment name, such as `production` or `staging`. The default value should be `production`.

```json
{
  "environment": "production"
}
```

`modules`

: A list of relevant modules and their versions.

```json
{
  "modules": {
    "my.module.name": "1.0"
  }
}
```

`extra`

: An arbitrary mapping of additional metadata to store with the event.

```json
{
  "extra": {
    "my_key": 1,
    "some_other_value": "foo bar"
  }
}
```

`fingerprint`

: A list of strings used to dictate the deduplication of this event.

```json
{
  "fingerprint": ["myrpc", "POST", "/foo.bar"]
}
```

```json
{
  "fingerprint": ["{{ default }}", "http://example.com/my.url"]
}
```

For information about overriding grouping see [Customize Grouping with
Fingerprints](https://docs.sentry.io/data-management/event-grouping/).

`errors`

: A list of errors in capturing or handling this event. This provides meta data
  about event capturing and processing itself, not about the error or
  transaction that the event represents.

  This list is primarily populated by Sentry when receiving and processing the
  event. SDKs are only encouraged to add entries here if there are severe
  conditions that Sentry cannot detect by inspecting the remaining payload.

  Errors must contain a required `type` field, which can be one of the types
  declared in the Sentry [EventError] model. If there is no applicable type
  variant, consider [opening an issue] to suggest the addition.

  Apart from types, any attribute is valid. There are conventions for the
  semantics of common error attributes, if they are included:

- `name`: A string declaring the path to the payload field that causes or
  exhibits the error. For example `modules[0].name`.
- `value`: The original value of a field that causes or exhibits the error.


```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "type": "unknown_error",
      "path": "/var/logs/errors.log.1",
      "details": "Failed to read attachment"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Core Interfaces

All values in the event payload that are not basic attributes are data
interfaces. The key is the canonical interface short name, and the value is the
data expected by the interface (usually a dictionary).

For the most part, interfaces are an evolving part of Sentry. Like with
attributes, SDKs are expected to assume that more interfaces will be added at
any point in the future.

The core data interfaces are:

- [Exception Interface](exception/)
- [Message Interface](message/)
- [Stack Trace Interface](stacktrace/)
- [Template Interface](template/)

## Scope Interfaces

- [Breadcrumbs Interface](breadcrumbs/)
- [User Interface](user/)
- [Request Interface](request/)
- [Contexts Interface](contexts/)
- [Threads Interface](threads/)

## Other Interfaces

- [Debug Meta Interface](debugmeta/)
- [SDK Interface](sdk/)
- [Lock Reason Interface](lockreason/)

## Type Definitions

- [Event Type Definitions](types/)
