title: User Interface

An interface which describes the authenticated User for a request.

You should provide at least one of `id`, `email`, `ip_address`,
`username` for Sentry to be able to tell you how many users are
affected by one issue (for example). Sending a user that has none
of these attributes (and only custom attributes) is valid, but not as useful.

## Attributes

`id`

: The unique ID of the user.

`email`

: The email address of the user.

`ip_address`

: The IP of the user.

`username`

: The username of the user.

All other keys are stored as extra information but not specifically processed by
Sentry.

## Examples

```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": "unique_id",
    "username": "my_user",
    "email": "foo@example.com",
    "ip_address": "127.0.0.1",
    "subscription": "basic"
  }
}
```
