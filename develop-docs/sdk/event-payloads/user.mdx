An interface describing the authenticated User for a request.

You should provide at least one of `id`, `email`, `ip_address`,
`username` for Sentry to be able to tell you how many users are
affected by one issue, for example. Sending a user that has none
of these attributes and only custom attributes is valid, but not as useful.

## Attributes

`id`

: The application-specific internal identifier for the user.

`username`

: The username. Typically used as a better label than the internal id.

`email`

: An alternative, or addition, to the username. Sentry is aware of email addresses and can display things such as Gravatars and unlock messaging capabilities.

`ip_address`

: The user's IP address. If the user is unauthenticated, Sentry uses the IP address as a unique identifier for the user. Set to `"{{auto}}"` to let Sentry infer the IP address from the connection.

`segment`

: The user segment, for apps that divide users in user segments.

All other keys are stored as extra information but not specifically processed by
Sentry.

`geo`

: An optional object describing the [geographical location](#geographical-location) of the end user or device, this object is automatically inferred by Relay if `ip_address` is provided.

## Geographical location

Approximate geographical location of the end user or device.

### Attributes

`city`

: Human readable city name.

`country_code`

: Two-letter country code (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2).

`region`

: Human readable region name or code.

## Automatic IP addresses

SDKs running on client platforms, such as browsers and mobile applications,
should set `ip_address = "{{auto}}"` by default. Server-side SDKs should
populate the [Request Interface](/sdk/event-payloads/request/), instead. Sentry
employs several fallbacks to backfill the IP address:

1. Use `user.ip_address`, if set directly.
2. Fall back to `http.env.REMOTE_ADDR`, if available.
3. The connection's IP address as seen by Sentry, if `{{auto}}` was used.

## Examples

```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": "unique_id",
    "username": "my_user",
    "email": "foo@example.com",
    "ip_address": "127.0.0.1",
    "subscription": "basic"
  }
}
```
