title: Transaction Payloads

Transactions are used to send tracing events to Sentry.

Transactions must be wrapped in an [Envelope](/sdk/envelopes/) and therefore also be sent to the Envelope endpoint.

<Alert title="Note on backwards compatibility" level="info">
  Envelopes are a new format and therefore only work on Sentry >= 10. More

## Anatomy

A Transaction is basically a [Span](/sdk/event-payloads/span/) combined with an [Event](/sdk/event-payloads/). When using
tracing with our SDKs you usually create a Span tree, the root node and therefore the whole tree is considered to be the Transaction.
So technically a Transaction is just a Span. A Transaction must also have a `contexts.trace` (which contains some data of the [Span](/sdk/event-payloads/span/)) and some other
properties that will be covered in the next section.

Transactions are [Events](/sdk/event-payloads/) enriched with [Span](/sdk/event-payloads/span/) data.
We are only going to list here what is important for a Transaction.
