title: Transaction Payloads
---

Transactions are used to send tracing events to Sentry.

Transactions must be wrapped in an [Envelope](/sdk/envelopes/) and therefore also be sent to the Envelope endpoint.

<Alert title="Note on backwards compatibility" level="info">
  Envelopes are a new format and therefore only work on Sentry >= 10. More
  information can be found on the <Link to="/sdk/envelopes/">Envelope</Link> page.

## Anatomy

A Transaction is basically a [Span](/sdk/event-payloads/span/) combined with an [Event](/sdk/event-payloads/). When using
tracing with our SDKs you usually create a Span tree, the root node and therefore the whole tree is considered to be the Transaction.
So technically a Transaction is just a Span. A Transaction must also have a `contexts.trace` (which contains some data of the [Span](/sdk/event-payloads/span/)) and some other
properties that will be covered in the next section.

Transactions are [Events](/sdk/event-payloads/) enriched with [Span](/sdk/event-payloads/span/) data.
We are only going to list here what is important for a Transaction.

import "./properties/span_start_timestamp.mdx";

import "./properties/span_timestamp.mdx";

### contexts.trace

A Transaction has to have a specific `contexts.trace` entry that contains data from the [Span](/sdk/event-payloads/span/).

import "./properties/span_id.mdx";

import "./properties/parent_span_id.mdx";

import "./properties/trace_id.mdx";

import "./properties/op.mdx";

import "./properties/description.mdx";

import "./properties/status.mdx";

## Examples

```json
{
  "contexts": {
    "trace": {
      "op": "navigation",
      "description": "User clicked on <Link />",
      "trace_id": "743ad8bbfdd84e99bc38b4729e2864de",
      "span_id": "a0cfbde2bdff3adc",
      "status": "ok",
      "parent_span_id": "99659d76b7cdae94"
    }
  }
}
```
