title: Lock Reason Interface
---

Represents an instance of a held lock (monitor object) in a thread. Typically, this information is useful
to determine which other thread is holding the lock in case the current thread is blocked. In languages like
`Java` or `Kotlin` this typically will be represented by a `java.lang.Object` type.

<Note>

Lock reasons are always part of a [thread](/sdk/event-payloads/threads/). They cannot be declared as a top-level event property.
