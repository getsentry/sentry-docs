title: Lock Reason Interface
---

Represents an instance of a held lock (monitor object) in a thread. Typically, this information is useful
to determine which other thread is holding the lock in case the current thread is blocked. In languages like
`Java` or `Kotlin` this typically will be represented by a `java.lang.Object` type.

## Attributes

`type`

: **Required**. Type of lock on the thread with available options being blocked, waiting, sleeping and locked.

`address`

: _Optional_. Memory address of the monitor object.

`package_name`

: _Optional_. Package name of the monitor object.

`class_name`

: _Optional_. Class name of the monitor object.

`thread_id`

: _Optional_.  Thread ID that's holding the lock.

## Examples

```json
{
  "type": 8,
  "address": "0x07d7437b",
  "package_name": "android.database.sqlite",
  "class_name": "SQLiteConnection",
  "thread_id": 2
}
```
