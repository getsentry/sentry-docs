So you want to develop an SDK?  Before you get started here are some basics that are
worth following to have a better experience.

Run a Local Relay
-----------------

You do not need a local Sentry for SDK development but you will want to run a local
[relay](https://docs.sentry.io/product/relay/).  The reason for this is that Sentry's
main ingestion endpoint is not intended for development but for high throughput
production use.  What this means is that a lot of the event processing is happening
after the event has already been accepted by the system so you won't be able to see
errors when sending the HTTP request.

If you haven't used relay yet, have a look at the [getting started](https://docs.sentry.io/product/relay/getting-started/)
docs for relay.  Once installed you will want to turn up the log level in your
`.relay/config.yml` file:

```yaml
logging:
  level: trace
```

Make sure your relay is running whenever you're doing development:

```shell
relay run
```

When sending events just substitute `orgXXX.ingest.sentry.io` with `localhost:3000` or
whichever port you ended up chosing.  Also note that a local relay will out of the box
be available via HTTP only so don't try to send HTTPS requests there.

Join the SDK maintainers channel on Discord
---------------------

You can reach out to Sentry open source contributors and find other SDK maintainers in the [Sentry Discord server](https://discord.gg/sentry). Make sure to say hi on `#sdk-maintainers`.

Consult Existing SDKs
---------------------

While we're trying to keep the docs up to date about all important things, it's usually
a good idea to refer to already existing Sentry SDKs for input.  In particular the
transport design is not part of the documentation but generally quite similar between
SDKs.
