You do not need a local Sentry instance for SDK development, but you will want to run a local
[Relay](https://docs.sentry.io/product/relay/). Sentry's main ingestion endpoint is designed for high-throughput production use — event processing happens after acceptance, so you won't see errors in the HTTP response during development.

## Setup

If you haven't used Relay yet, see the [Relay getting started](https://docs.sentry.io/product/relay/getting-started/) docs. Once installed, turn up the log level in your `.relay/config.yml`:

```yaml
logging:
  level: trace
```

## Running

```shell
relay run
```

When sending events, substitute `orgXXX.ingest.sentry.io` with `localhost:3000` (or whichever port you chose).

Note that a local Relay is available via HTTP only by default — do not send HTTPS requests to it.
