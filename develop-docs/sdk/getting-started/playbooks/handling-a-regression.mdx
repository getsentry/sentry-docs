    summary: Initial playbook — regression response with severity assessment and expedited patch process
---

<SpecRfcAlert />

<SpecMeta />

## Overview

This playbook guides SDK maintainers through handling regressions discovered after a release. It covers severity assessment, response options (patch release vs. rollback), communication protocols, and post-incident review. By following these steps, regressions will be resolved quickly with minimal user impact.

- [Post-release monitoring](/sdk/getting-started/standards/coordination-maintenance#post-release-monitoring) — how regressions are detected
- [Rollback procedures](/sdk/getting-started/standards/coordination-maintenance#rollback-procedures) — emergency rollback process
- [Cutting a Release](/sdk/getting-started/playbooks/cutting-a-release) — standard release process (expedited for patches)

## Steps

#### 1. Assess severity

Classify the regression using these criteria:

- **Critical** (crashes, data loss, security vulnerability) → patch release **MUST** be cut within 48 hours
- **High** (broken feature, significant performance degradation) → patch release **SHOULD** be cut within 1 week
- **Medium** (edge case, cosmetic issue) → fix **MAY** be included in next regular release

#### 2. For critical or high severity regressions

You **MUST** take one of the following actions:

**Option A: Revert and patch**
- Revert the problematic commit(s) on a release branch
- Use the revert commit format: `revert: <original commit subject>`
- Cut a patch release following [Cutting a Release](/sdk/getting-started/playbooks/cutting-a-release), expedited — you **MAY** skip non-essential gates for critical severity

**Option B: Yank the release**
- If a clean revert isn't possible, yank the bad release from the package registry
- Follow the documented rollback procedure: [Rollback procedures](/sdk/getting-started/standards/coordination-maintenance#rollback-procedures)

#### 3. Communicate

You **MUST** post a GitHub issue describing:
- What happened (brief explanation of the regression)
- Which versions are affected
- What users should do (pin to previous version, or upgrade to the patch)

#### 4. Add to the quarterly retro

Document the incident for the quarterly retrospective:
- What happened
- How it was caught (or why it wasn't caught in testing)
- What would have prevented it

This helps identify gaps in testing, review processes, or monitoring that can be improved.
