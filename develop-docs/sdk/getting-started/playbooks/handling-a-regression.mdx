title: Handling a Regression
---

## Steps

#### 1. Assess severity

- **Critical** (crashes, data loss, security vulnerability) → patch release within 48 hours
- **High** (broken feature, significant performance degradation) → patch release within 1 week
- **Medium** (edge case, cosmetic issue) → fix in next regular release

#### 2. For critical or high severity

- Revert the problematic commit(s) on a release branch
- Use the revert commit format: `revert: <original commit subject>`
- Cut a patch release following [Cutting a release](cutting-a-release), expedited — skip non-essential gates
- If a clean revert isn't possible, yank the bad release from the package registry using the documented [rollback procedure](../per-sdk-overrides/) ([Rollback procedures](../standards/coordination-maintenance#rollback-procedures))

#### 3. Communicate

Post a GitHub issue describing:
- What happened
- Which versions are affected
- What users should do (pin to previous version, or upgrade to the patch)

#### 4. Add to the quarterly retro

([Quarterly retro](quarterly-retro)): what happened, how it was caught, what would have prevented it.
