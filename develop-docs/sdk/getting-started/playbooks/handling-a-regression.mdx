## Overview

This playbook guides SDK maintainers through handling regressions discovered after a release.

**Note:** This playbook is currently a placeholder. Detailed content will be added in a future update.

## Steps

#### 1. Assess severity

Determine if the regression is critical (requires immediate action) or can wait for the next release.

#### 2. Decide on response

Based on severity, choose:
- Emergency patch release
- Rollback/yank the problematic release
- Include fix in next scheduled release

#### 3. Follow rollback procedures if needed

See [Rollback procedures](/sdk/getting-started/standards/coordination-maintenance#rollback-procedures).

#### 4. Communicate

Notify affected users and stakeholders.
