title: Reviewing a PR
---

## Steps

#### 1. Check the PR description

Does it explain what and why? Is there a linked issue? If either is missing, request it before reviewing code.

#### 2. Check CI status

If checks are failing, comment on what's broken and wait. Don't review code that doesn't build or pass tests.

#### 3. Review the code

Use the [code review checklist](https://develop.sentry.dev/engineering-practices/code-review/). Focus on:
- Runtime errors and potential crashes
- Performance concerns (N+1 queries, unbounded operations)
- Unintended side effects or behavior changes
- Backwards compatibility
- Security vulnerabilities
- Test coverage appropriate for the change type ([Test requirements by change type](../standards/code-quality#test-requirements-by-change-type))
- Test quality — do assertions verify real behavior? ([Test quality](../standards/code-quality#test-quality))

#### 4. Check for senior review triggers

([Required reviewers](../standards/review-ci#required-reviewers)): public API changes, new dependencies, schema changes, security-sensitive code, new frameworks. If any apply and no senior reviewer is assigned, flag it.

#### 5. Use LOGAF prefixes on all feedback

([Review feedback conventions](../standards/review-ci#review-feedback-conventions)):
- `h:` (high) — must fix before merge. Bugs, security issues, breakage, data loss.
- `m:` (medium) — should fix. Design concerns, missing tests, unclear code.
- `l:` (low) — optional nit. Style preferences, minor suggestions.

#### 6. Approve when only `l:` items remain

Don't block for style preferences. The goal is risk reduction, not perfection.
