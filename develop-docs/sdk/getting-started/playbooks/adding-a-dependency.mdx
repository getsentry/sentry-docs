title: Adding a Dependency
---

## Steps

#### 1. Open an issue first

Describe: what the dependency does, why the functionality can't be built in-house or isn't already covered by an existing dependency.

#### 2. Document in the issue

- Maintenance health (last release date, number of maintainers, open issue count)
- Security posture (known vulnerabilities, audit history)
- License compatibility
- Size impact on the SDK ([SDK size and performance budgets](../standards/code-quality#sdk-size-and-performance-budgets))

#### 3. Get explicit approval

From the team lead in the issue before writing any code.

#### 4. In the PR

- Pin to a version range (not floating `latest`)
- Add to dependency audit tracking
- Note the size/performance impact in the PR description

#### 5. Security review

Use **Skill: `sentry-skills:security-review`** for security implications of the new dependency.

#### 6. Reviewer must explicitly acknowledge the new dependency

Not just approve the PR overall. The review comment should confirm the dependency was evaluated.
