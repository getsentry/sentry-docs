title: Deprecating an API
---

## Steps

#### 1. If this is a multi-SDK deprecation

Follow the [Cross-SDK rollout](cross-sdk-rollout) process first to coordinate timing and approach.

#### 2. Announce in a minor release

- Add a deprecation warning in code that includes: what to use instead, a code example of the migration, and a link to documentation
- Add a changelog entry explaining the deprecation and the migration path
- Open a docs PR with a migration guide containing copy-pastable before/after examples ([Documentation-with-code](../standards/repository-docs#documentation-with-code))
- Test the migration guide by having an AI tool follow it — if the tool can't complete the migration, rewrite the guide

#### 3. Maintain

The deprecated API stays functional for at least one full minor release cycle. Tests for the deprecated code path remain and must continue to pass.

#### 4. Remove in the next major version only

- Remove the API and its tests
- Include `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the commit footer ([Breaking change process](../standards/api-architecture#breaking-change-process))
- Update the migration guide to reference the major version that removes it

#### 5. Communicate

Changelog entry, docs update. For high-impact deprecations, consider a blog post or announcement.
