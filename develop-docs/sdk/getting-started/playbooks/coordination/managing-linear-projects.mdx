## Overview

This playbook covers how SDK work is organized in Linear — from initiatives at
the top of the hierarchy down to individual issues. It guides teams through
choosing the right level of organization, setting up and running projects, and
managing standalone backlog work that does not belong to a project.

SDK work falls under the **Great Data Capture** goal — see *Goal Hierarchy* (internal).

## The Linear hierarchy

SDK work maps to four levels in Linear:

| Level | What goes here |
|---|---|
| **Initiative** | A strategic area of work — product feature area, cross-SDK alignment effort, or maintenance theme |
| **Sub-initiative** | A specific effort within an initiative — used especially for cross-SDK rollouts where multiple teams deliver independently |
| **Project** | Time-bounded delivery tracked by one SDK team — always lives under an initiative or sub-initiative |
| **Issue** | Individual unit of work — lives inside a project or standalone in the team backlog |

The [Issue Quality](/sdk/getting-started/standards/planning-scoping#issue-quality) and [Definition of Done](/sdk/getting-started/standards/planning-scoping#definition-of-done) standards apply at the issue level regardless of whether the issue belongs to a project.

---

## Initiatives

Every project **MUST** be linked to an initiative before work begins. Projects **MUST NOT** be orphaned (no parent initiative) if they represent tracked delivery effort.

SDK work falls into three initiative categories — choose the one that fits:

| Category | Use when… |
|---|---|
| **Product feature work** | Implementing a new SDK capability aligned to a product area (e.g., a new signal type, a new first-party integration) |
| **Cross-SDK alignment** | Standardizing an existing API, protocol behavior, or data format across multiple SDKs |
| **SDK maintenance** | Everything else: major releases, ecosystem compatibility, code health, infrastructure, developer experience |

If the correct initiative does not exist yet, create one or confirm the category with your team lead before proceeding.

### Cross-SDK alignment: sub-initiatives

When a change requires alignment across multiple SDKs, it **MUST** be tracked as a sub-initiative with one project per SDK team — not as a single project with issues from multiple teams. Project names **MUST** follow the [Project Naming](/sdk/getting-started/standards/planning-scoping#project-naming) standard: `[Effort name] [SDK name]`.

For the full process — proposal, review periods, sequencing, and documentation coordination — follow the [Aligning Cross-SDK Changes](/sdk/getting-started/playbooks/coordination/aligning-cross-sdk-changes) playbook.

## Projects

### Setup

Run these steps in order when starting a new project.

#### 1. Create the project and set required attributes

You **MUST** set all of the following attributes before sharing the project with the team:

- **Title**: follow the [Project Naming](/sdk/getting-started/standards/planning-scoping#project-naming) standard — cross-SDK rollout projects use `[Effort name] [SDK name]` (e.g., `OTLP Integration [Python]`); standalone projects use a clear, action-oriented title
- **Initiative**: link to the appropriate initiative (see [Initiatives](#initiatives) above); **MUST** be set before work begins
- **Lead**: a single owner (not a team)
- **Status**: set to the appropriate state (`Planned`, `In Progress`, etc.)
- **Target date**: realistic delivery date; **MUST** be set before the project moves to **In Progress**
- **Team**: the owning SDK team
- **Description**: scope, goals, and non-goals; verbose enough that a new team member can orient themselves without asking

A project without a lead, initiative, or target date **MUST NOT** be moved to **In Progress**.

#### 2. Add pre-implementation documentation

Before implementation begins, you **MUST** complete all pre-implementation documentation required by the [Design-First Gate](/sdk/getting-started/standards/planning-scoping#design-first-gate) and [Risk Identification](/sdk/getting-started/standards/planning-scoping#risk-identification) standards.

- If the estimate is greater than **M** or the change affects more than one SDK, a design document (**RFC**, **Tech Spec**, **PRFAQ**, or **DACI**) **MUST** be linked in the project's **Documentation** field.
- The design document **MUST** be complete (not a draft or stub) before the first implementation PR is reviewed.
- The design document **MUST** include a risk section; any high-rated risks **MUST** be resolved before the first implementation issue moves to **In Progress**.
- If a design document is not required (small, single-SDK change), document this explicitly in the project description.

#### 3. Set up a communication channel

You **MUST** set up or re-use a dedicated communication channel for the project before team members begin work:

- Create or identify a Slack channel (e.g., `#proj-<feature-name>`, `#team-sdks`) for async updates and discussion.
- Link the channel in the Linear project's **Documentation** field or add it as a note in the project description.
- For small projects (single engineer, ≤ 1 week of work), a dedicated channel **MAY** be omitted if the team agrees updates will flow through an existing channel.

Announce the project in relevant team channels once the project and channel are set up.

#### 4. Create and triage the issue backlog

Before moving the project to **In Progress**, create and triage the initial issue backlog:

- All issues **MUST** meet the [Issue Quality](/sdk/getting-started/standards/planning-scoping#issue-quality) requirements: assignee, verbose description, SDK label, type label, estimate, and priority.
- Issues estimated larger than **M** **MUST** be split before they are moved to **Todo**.
- Use a spike (timeboxed per the [Spike Timeboxing](/sdk/getting-started/standards/planning-scoping#spike-timeboxing) standard) for any work that is too uncertain to estimate.
- Apply priorities clearly: mark blockers and critical-path issues as high priority.

For AI-assisted decomposition of the backlog, follow the [AI-Assisted Planning](/sdk/getting-started/standards/planning-scoping#ai-assisted-planning) standard — all AI-generated sub-issues **MUST** be reviewed and approved before moving to **Todo**.

### During the project

These are ongoing responsibilities — not a sequence. They apply from the moment the project moves to **In Progress** until it closes.

#### Maintain backlog hygiene

Observe the following WIP limits at all times:

- **Todo**: keep at most **5** issues ready (estimated, assigned, unblocked) at any time.
- **In Progress**: keep at most **3** issues active per engineer at any time.
- **In Review**: keep at most **3** issues awaiting review; issues stale for more than 2 business days **SHOULD** be escalated to the team lead.

At each weekly sync (or equivalent cadence):

- Move stale issues back to **Backlog** if they are no longer ready.
- Re-estimate or split issues that have grown beyond **M** per the [Issue Quality](/sdk/getting-started/standards/planning-scoping#issue-quality) standard.
- Close or archive issues that are no longer in scope with a brief note explaining why.

#### Handle incoming issues and PRs

Issues and PRs that arrive while the project is active **MUST** go through the standard triage process — follow the [Triaging](/sdk/getting-started/playbooks/coordination/triaging) playbook. The project lead is responsible for ensuring nothing stagnates.

#### Visibility for major releases

If the project delivers a **major release** or a **user-visible feature**:

- Create a public GitHub issue (or link an existing one) to track community interest and questions.
- Coordinate documentation PRs so they land at the same time as the SDK release — docs **MUST NOT** go live before the SDK ships (see [Aligning Cross-SDK Changes](/sdk/getting-started/playbooks/coordination/aligning-cross-sdk-changes)).
- Post a project update at least once per week while the project is **In Progress**.

For changes that only affect internal implementation details with no user-facing impact, public visibility **MAY** be omitted.

### Closing out

Run these steps in order when all implementation and documentation is shipped.

Verify closure against the [Definition of Done](/sdk/getting-started/standards/planning-scoping#definition-of-done) standard before setting the project to **Done**.

1. Verify all issues in the project are either **Done** or explicitly **Cancelled** with a note.
2. Post a final update summarizing: what shipped, any known follow-up work, and lessons learned.
3. Set the project status to **Done**. A project **MUST NOT** be set to **Done** if there are open issues that are not yet resolved or intentionally cancelled.
4. Archive the project Slack channel (or post a close-out message) so team members know the project is complete.
5. If retrospective notes are warranted, file them as a linked document on the project or post to the team's retro thread.

A project in **Done** status means all planned work is complete or explicitly deferred to a new project. It does not mean "mostly done" or "close enough."

## Standalone issues and backlog work

Issues that are not part of a project — bugs accepted from triage, backlog items, community-reported issues — are worked under the same rules as project issues. The [Issue Quality](/sdk/getting-started/standards/planning-scoping#issue-quality) and [Definition of Done](/sdk/getting-started/standards/planning-scoping#definition-of-done) standards apply equally.

The same WIP limits apply: no more than **3** issues **In Progress** per engineer at any time.

**When to escalate to a project**: if a standalone issue grows beyond **M**, or if related issues accumulate to a point where tracked delivery is beneficial, convert to a project and follow the Setup steps above.

See [Managing Issues](/sdk/getting-started/playbooks/coordination/managing-issues) for the detailed standalone issue workflow.
