    summary: Initial playbook — setting up and running a Linear project through its full lifecycle
---

<SpecRfcAlert />

<SpecMeta />

## Overview

This playbook guides project leads through setting up, running, and closing a Linear project for SDK work. It covers creating required attributes, linking initiatives, pre-implementation documentation, communication setup, backlog management, and project closure. Following these steps ensures SDK projects are visible, well-scoped, and consistently tracked from kickoff to done.

SDK project work falls under the **Great Data Capture** goal — see *Goal Hierarchy* (internal).

## Steps

#### 1. Create the project and set required attributes

You **MUST** create a new Linear project with all of the following attributes set before sharing it with the team:

- **Title**: follow the [Project Naming](/sdk/getting-started/standards/planning-scoping#project-naming) standard — cross-SDK rollout projects use `[Effort name] [SDK name]` (e.g., `OTLP Integration [Python]`); standalone projects use a clear, action-oriented title
- **Lead**: assigned to the project lead (single owner, not a team)
- **Status**: set to the appropriate state (`Planned`, `In Progress`, etc.)
- **Target date**: realistic delivery date; **MUST** be set before the project moves to **In Progress**
- **Team**: the owning SDK team
- **Description**: scope, goals, and non-goals; verbose enough that a new team member can orient themselves without asking

A project without a lead or target date **MUST NOT** be moved to **In Progress**.

#### 2. Link the project to an initiative

You **MUST** link the project to the appropriate Linear initiative before any work begins. Projects **MUST NOT** be orphaned (no parent initiative) if they represent tracked delivery effort.

SDK work falls into three initiative categories — choose the one that fits:

| Category | Use when… |
|---|---|
| **Product feature work** | Implementing a new SDK capability aligned to a product area (e.g., a new signal type, a new first-party integration) |
| **Cross-SDK alignment** | Standardizing an existing API, protocol behavior, or data format across multiple SDKs |
| **SDK maintenance** | Everything else: major releases, ecosystem compatibility, code health, infrastructure, developer experience |

If the correct initiative does not exist yet, create one or confirm the category with your team lead before proceeding.

For cross-SDK alignment work, follow the [Aligning Cross-SDK Changes](/sdk/getting-started/playbooks/coordination/aligning-cross-sdk-changes) playbook. The project **MUST** be created as a per-SDK project under the appropriate alignment sub-initiative, not as a standalone project.

#### 3. Add pre-implementation documentation

Before implementation begins, you **MUST** complete all pre-implementation documentation required by the [Design-First Gate](/sdk/getting-started/standards/planning-scoping#design-first-gate) and [Risk Identification](/sdk/getting-started/standards/planning-scoping#risk-identification) standards.

- If the estimate is greater than **M** or the change affects more than one SDK, a design document (**RFC**, **Tech Spec**, **PRFAQ**, or **DACI**) **MUST** be linked in the project's **Documentation** field.
- The design document **MUST** be complete (not a draft or stub) before the first implementation PR is reviewed.
- The design document **MUST** include a risk section; any high-rated risks **MUST** be resolved before the first implementation issue moves to **In Progress**.
- If a design document is not required (small, single-SDK change), document this explicitly in the project description.

#### 4. Set up a communication channel

You **MUST** set up a dedicated communication channel for the project before team members begin work:

- Create or identify a Slack channel (e.g., `#sdk-<feature-name>`) for async updates and discussion.
- Link the channel in the Linear project's **Documentation** field or add it as a note in the project description.
- For small projects (single engineer, ≤ 1 week of work), a dedicated channel **MAY** be omitted if the team agrees updates will flow through an existing channel.

Announce the project in relevant team channels once the project and channel are set up.

#### 5. Create and triage the issue backlog

Before moving the project to **In Progress**, create and triage the initial issue backlog:

- All issues **MUST** meet the [Issue Quality](/sdk/getting-started/standards/planning-scoping#issue-quality) requirements: assignee, verbose description, SDK label, type label, estimate, and priority.
- Issues estimated larger than **M** **MUST** be split before they are moved to **Todo**.
- Use a spike (timeboxed per the [Spike Timeboxing](/sdk/getting-started/standards/planning-scoping#spike-timeboxing) standard) for any work that is too uncertain to estimate.
- Apply priorities clearly: mark blockers and critical-path issues as high priority.

For AI-assisted decomposition of the backlog, follow the [AI-Assisted Planning](/sdk/getting-started/standards/planning-scoping#ai-assisted-planning) standard — all AI-generated sub-issues **MUST** be reviewed and approved before moving to **Todo**.

#### 6. Maintain backlog hygiene

Ongoing throughout the project, observe the following WIP limits:

- **Todo**: keep at most **5** issues ready (estimated, assigned, unblocked) at any time.
- **In Progress**: keep at most **3** issues active per engineer at any time.
- **In Review**: keep at most **3** issues awaiting review; issues stale for more than 2 business days **SHOULD** be escalated to the team lead.

At each weekly sync (or equivalent cadence):

- Move stale issues back to **Backlog** if they are no longer ready.
- Re-estimate or split issues that have grown beyond **M** per the [Issue Quality](/sdk/getting-started/standards/planning-scoping#issue-quality) standard.
- Close or archive issues that are no longer in scope with a brief note explaining why.

#### 7. Handle community contributions

If a community PR (external contributor) is opened against work tracked in the project:

- Triage it within **2 business days** per the [Triaging SLA](/sdk/getting-started/standards/coordination-maintenance#triaging-sla) standard.
- Follow the [Handling an External Contributor PR](/sdk/getting-started/playbooks/development/handling-external-contributor-pr) playbook.
- If the PR is "lonely" (no response from the team for > 2 business days), the project lead is responsible for picking it up or explicitly delegating.

#### 8. Set up visibility for major releases

If the project delivers a **major release** or a **user-visible feature**:

- Create a public GitHub issue (or link an existing one) to track community interest and questions.
- Coordinate documentation PRs so they land at the same time as the SDK release — docs **MUST NOT** go live before the SDK ships (see [Aligning Cross-SDK Changes: Step 7](/sdk/getting-started/playbooks/coordination/aligning-cross-sdk-changes)).
- Post a project update at least once per week while the project is **In Progress**.

For changes that only affect internal implementation details with no user-facing impact, public visibility **MAY** be omitted.

#### 9. Close out the project

When all implementation and documentation is shipped:

1. Verify all issues in the project are either **Done** or explicitly **Cancelled** with a note.
2. Post a final update summarizing: what shipped, any known follow-up work, and lessons learned.
3. Set the project status to **Done**. A project **MUST NOT** be set to **Done** if there are open issues that are not yet resolved or intentionally cancelled.
4. Archive the project Slack channel (or post a close-out message) so team members know the project is complete.
5. If retrospective notes are warranted, file them as a linked document on the project or post to the team's retro thread.

Verify closure against the [Definition of Done](/sdk/getting-started/standards/planning-scoping#definition-of-done) standard before setting the project to **Done**. A project in **Done** status means all planned work is complete or explicitly deferred to a new project. It does not mean "mostly done" or "close enough."
