    summary: Initial boilerplate — managing standalone Linear issues through their lifecycle
---

<SpecRfcAlert />

<SpecMeta />

## Overview

This playbook guides SDK maintainers through working on Linear issues that are **not** part of a tracked project — issues accepted from triage, backlog items, and community-reported bugs. The same [Issue Quality](/sdk/getting-started/standards/planning-scoping#issue-quality) and [Definition of Done](/sdk/getting-started/standards/planning-scoping#definition-of-done) standards apply to standalone issues as to project issues.
