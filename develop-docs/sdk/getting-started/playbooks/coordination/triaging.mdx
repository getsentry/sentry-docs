    summary: Initial playbook — triage intake, acknowledgement, normalisation, and routing workflow
---

<SpecRfcAlert />

<SpecMeta />

## Overview

This playbook guides SDK maintainers through the triage process for incoming items — whether raised as GitHub issues or pull requests, reported via Discord or Slack, or surfaced through other channels. It covers monitoring intake channels, acknowledging new items, normalising them in Linear, and routing them to the correct outcome. By following these steps, all reported items receive timely, consistent responses and nothing stagnates in the queue.

Each repository **MUST** have a triage rotation in place that includes all maintainers (including contractors). The rotation **MAY** be daily or weekly depending on the team's needs. A designated triage owner **MUST** be accountable at any given time. All maintainers **MUST** be added to Linear triage notifications — single-maintainer repositories automatically assign items to the sole maintainer.

Triage **SHOULD** prioritise acknowledgement and categorisation over immediate fixes.

## Steps

#### 1. Monitor intake channels

Monitor the following channels daily:

- Linear SDK triage queue
- GitHub issues and PRs
- Discord and Slack SDK-related questions

Items **MAY** arrive through any of these channels. Social media is out of scope — redirect SDK questions to the monitored channels above.

#### 2. Acknowledge new items

Any new SDK-related item **MUST** receive an initial response within **2 business days** ([Triaging SLA](/sdk/getting-started/standards/coordination-maintenance#triaging-sla)), regardless of the channel it arrived through.

The response **MUST** acknowledge receipt and set expectations — a clarifying question, next steps, or a likely outcome. The initial response does not imply acceptance, prioritisation, or commitment to work.

Use the [acknowledgement saved replies](/sdk/getting-started/templates/saved-replies#acknowledging-issues) as a starting point.

#### 3. Normalise the item

Before routing, ensure the item is properly recorded in Linear:

- If no associated Linear issue exists, one **MUST** be created
- If a duplicate exists, mark it as *Duplicate of* in Linear
- The Linear issue **MUST** have at least a **`Type`** label and an **`SDK`** label
- For teams whose repos sync Linear to GitHub: be aware the issue will be publicly visible once
  created. Write the description for a public audience, or use a Linear-only umbrella team issue
  for internal tracking. See [GitHub sync and
  visibility](/sdk/getting-started/playbooks/coordination/managing-linear-projects#github-sync-and-visibility)
  in Managing Linear Projects for guidance on which teams sync.
- **MUST NOT** include customer-identifiable information, PII, or sensitive support data in the
  Linear issue description or comments — regardless of sync status.

#### 4. Route the item

Every item **MUST** exit the triage queue via exactly one of the following paths:

**Close as non-actionable** — used when the item is clearly out of scope, invalid, or required clarification has not been provided within 7–14 days of the last response. Close the Linear issue with the appropriate status, link to documentation or alternatives where relevant, and include a brief explanation referencing any prior requests for information.

**Resolve directly** — used when the item is small, low risk, well understood, or high priority and can reasonably be addressed during triage. Resolve the item and update or close the Linear issue. Communication **SHOULD** briefly confirm the resolution and describe what was done.

**Accept the item** — used when the item requires further investigation, design, or implementation beyond triage. Move the Linear issue to Backlog or Todo and assign a priority, assignee, size estimate, and a clear problem statement with expected outcome. Acknowledge acceptance and set expectations for next steps without committing to timelines unless known.

**Escalate or reassign** — used when the item requires broader discussion, different expertise, or clearly belongs to another team. Add a concise summary explaining the need for escalation or reassignment and transfer ownership. Communication **MUST** state why the item was escalated and who owns it next.

Prevent stagnation: escalate urgent issues and communicate unresolved issues promptly.
