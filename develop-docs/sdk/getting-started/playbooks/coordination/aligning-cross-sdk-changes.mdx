    summary: Initial playbook — cross-SDK coordination with Linear sub-initiatives, review periods, and documentation coordination
---

<SpecRfcAlert />

<SpecMeta />

## Overview

This playbook guides SDK teams through coordinating changes that affect multiple Sentry SDKs. It covers proposal writing, cross-team review, semantic conventions coordination, sequencing decisions, progress tracking, and documentation coordination. By following these steps, multi-SDK rollouts will be coordinated, predictable, and minimize surprises for users.

## Steps

#### 1. Write a proposal

You **MUST** create an RFC or Linear initiative describing:
- What's changing and why
- Which SDKs are affected
- Proposed rollout order
- Timeline
- Open questions

An RFC or initiative proposal is a design document and triggers the [Design-First Gate](/sdk/getting-started/standards/planning-scoping#design-first-gate) standard. It **MUST** also include a risk section per the [Risk Identification](/sdk/getting-started/standards/planning-scoping#risk-identification) standard.

#### 2. Allow cross-SDK review period

You **MUST** allow a minimum of 1 week for all affected SDK teams to review and comment on the proposal. This ensures all teams have time to:
- Assess implementation complexity for their SDK
- Identify platform-specific concerns
- Propose alternative approaches if needed

#### 3. Land semantic conventions first (if needed)

If the change involves new attributes, you **MUST** land the sentry-conventions PR first ([Semantic conventions process](/sdk/getting-started/standards/api-architecture#semantic-conventions-process)).

After the conventions PR is approved, you **MUST** wait 3 business days before implementing in any SDK. This grace period allows teams to review the final conventions and raise concerns.

#### 4. Agree on sequencing

Choose a rollout strategy:

**Option A: By adoption/maturity (Recommended)**
- Lower risk (learn from early implementations)
- Longer timeline
- Best for complex features or experimental changes
- This is the default approach for most cross-SDK changes

**Option B: All-at-once**
- Clean story for users (feature arrives everywhere simultaneously)
- Harder to coordinate across teams
- Best for critical security fixes or simple changes

The choice **SHOULD** be documented in the proposal and agreed upon by all teams.

#### 5. Create a Linear sub-initiative for SDK alignment

Any change or enhancement requiring alignment across multiple SDKs **MUST** be tracked as a sub-initiative in Linear, even if the change is small.

You **SHOULD** use the [`sentry-sdk-skills:linear-initiative`](https://github.com/getsentry/sdk-skills?tab=readme-ov-file#available-skills) skill to automate the creation of the Linear sub-initiative and per-SDK projects.

If not using the skill, you **MUST** manually:
- Create a sub-initiative under the appropriate parent initiative in Linear
- For each SDK team involved, create a separate **project** under this sub-initiative, named per the [Project Naming](/sdk/getting-started/standards/planning-scoping#project-naming) standard (`[Effort name] [SDK name]`)
- You **MUST NOT** use a single project with multiple issues, as the project is only completed once **all** SDK teams finish their work
- Each project **MUST** contain at least one issue with the **same title and description** as the project
- Additional issues **MAY** be added as needed but **SHOULD** remain within the scope of the alignment effort

This approach ensures accurate per-team progress tracking while maintaining visibility of the overall alignment effort.

##### If the change affects SDK users: Create a public issue

If the change or alignment is of interest to SDK users or customers, you **MAY** create one public GitHub issue to track community interest and questions.

This public issue **MAY** be omitted for changes that are:
- Too trivial to warrant public communication
- Should not be disclosed to customers or the public yet
- Internal implementation details without user-facing impact

#### 6. Implement in each SDK independently

Each team **MUST** follow their own PR process ([Opening a PR](/sdk/getting-started/playbooks/development/opening-a-pr), [Reviewing a PR](/sdk/getting-started/playbooks/development/reviewing-a-pr)). The Linear projects provide visibility, but each SDK maintains its own standards and timeline.

#### 7. Coordinate documentation

Documentation PRs **SHOULD** ship together or in clear sequence — not piecemeal. Users **MUST NOT** see docs for a change that hasn't reached their SDK yet.

Options:
- Hold all docs PRs until all SDKs ship
- Use platform-specific content that only appears when the SDK supports it
- Clearly label which SDK versions support the feature

#### 8. Conduct async retro after full rollout (optional)

After all SDKs have shipped, you **SHOULD** conduct an async retrospective documenting:
- What worked well
- What to improve for next time
- Unexpected challenges
- Process refinements

This helps improve future cross-SDK coordination.
