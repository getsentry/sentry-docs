    summary: Initial playbook — quarterly retrospective for cross-SDK process improvements
---

<SpecRfcAlert />

<SpecMeta />

## Overview

This playbook guides SDK teams through conducting a quarterly retrospective to identify and address cross-SDK process issues. It covers async question gathering, compilation, sync discussion, and actionable outcomes. By following these steps, teams continuously improve standards, playbooks, and collaboration patterns based on real experience.

## Steps

#### 1. Each SDK team answers questions asynchronously

Each SDK team **SHOULD** answer these questions in writing:
- What's the most common low-quality PR pattern we're seeing?
- What's the most annoying friction in our process?
- What standard or playbook is working well?
- What standard or playbook needs updating?
- Any regressions or incidents worth discussing?

This async format allows teams to provide thoughtful input on their own schedule.

#### 2. Compile answers into a shared document

You **MUST** consolidate all team responses into a single shared document for review before the sync meeting.

#### 3. Hold a focused sync meeting

You **SHOULD** hold a 30-minute sync meeting to discuss cross-cutting themes. This meeting **MUST** focus on patterns that affect multiple teams, not status updates.

The goal is to identify systemic issues and shared pain points, not to review every individual response.

#### 4. Create actionable outcomes

Based on the discussion, you **SHOULD** update:
- Standards that need revision
- Playbooks that need clarification or new content
- AGENTS.md files with improved instructions
- Saved replies for common scenarios

Document what will change and who owns each action.

#### 5. Track patterns across retros

You **SHOULD** review whether the same problems are recurring. If the same issue appears in multiple retros, the previous fix didn't work — try a different approach.

This meta-analysis helps identify deeper systemic issues versus one-time problems.
