## Overview

Sometimes we have long-running feature branches that can't be merged into `master` yet because they contain breaking changes (e.g. `sentry-sdk-2.0`, `potel-base` in python SDK, `8.x.x` in Java SDK). They have to be kept in sync with `master`/`main`.

You might be tempted to branch off the feature branch and do the merge there, maybe make a PR so that you can double-check the changes in the UI and make sure CI is green. In that case you need to make sure you **don't actually commit the merge from another branch** — the merge commit needs to be directly on the feature branch, otherwise `git` doesn't set the parent commits for the merge commit properly and the feature branch will still have unresolved conflicts.

---

## Steps

#### 1. Merge main into the feature branch

You **MUST** perform the merge directly on the feature branch so that git records the correct parent commits:

```bash
git checkout feature-branch
git merge master
```

#### 2. Resolve conflicts

Resolve all conflicts while still on the feature branch and commit the merge.

#### 3. Verify (optional)

If you want a GitHub diff and CI run before pushing:

- Open a new branch from the feature branch: `git checkout -b sync-feature-with-master`
- Push and create a PR to review the diff and CI results
- **Do NOT merge the PR** — merging from the temporary branch will not mark the merge conflicts as resolved on the feature branch

#### 4. Push the feature branch

Once satisfied, push directly from the feature branch:

```bash
git checkout feature-branch
git push
```

## Alternative Approaches

#### Alternative A — merge PR then empty merge (used for Java SDK `8.x.x`)

Note: this approach does not preserve full per-file history — history only works on the full repo.

1. Create a PR for merging `main` into the feature branch (e.g. `8.x.x`)
2. Once that PR is merged, the reverse PR (feature branch back to `main`) will still show conflicts
3. Do another merge of `main` into the feature branch where you accept all changes on the feature branch side and create an empty merge commit
4. **Caveat:** if there are new commits on `main` between steps, this won't work correctly

#### Alternative B — merge commit PR (untested)

1. Create a merge PR for merging `main` into the feature branch
2. When merging the PR, do not squash — create a merge commit (may need to enable this in repo settings)
