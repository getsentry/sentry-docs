title: Cross-SDK Rollout
---

## Steps

#### 1. Write a proposal

(RFC or issue) describing:
- What's changing and why
- Which SDKs are affected
- Proposed rollout order
- Timeline
- Open questions

Use the [cross-SDK proposal template](../templates/cross-sdk-proposal-template).

#### 2. Cross-SDK review period

Minimum 1 week for all affected SDK team leads to review and comment.

#### 3. Semantic conventions first

If the change involves new attributes, land the sentry-conventions PR first ([Semantic conventions process](../standards/api-architecture#semantic-conventions-process)). Wait 3 business days after approval before implementing in any SDK.

#### 4. Agree on sequencing

Options include all-at-once (clean story, harder to coordinate) or by adoption/maturity (lower risk, longer timeline).

#### 5. Create a tracking issue or project board

One item per SDK. Track status: not started, in progress, done.

#### 6. Each SDK team implements independently

Following their own PR process. The tracking board provides visibility across teams.

#### 7. Coordinate documentation

Docs PRs should ship together or in clear sequence — not piecemeal. Users shouldn't see docs for a change that hasn't reached their SDK yet.

#### 8. Async retro after full rollout

What worked, what to improve for next time.
