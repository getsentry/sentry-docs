## Overview

This playbook guides SDK teams through coordinating changes that affect multiple Sentry SDKs. It covers proposal writing, cross-team review, sequencing decisions, and coordinated rollout.

**Note:** This playbook is currently a placeholder. Detailed content will be added in a future update.

## Steps

#### 1. Write a proposal

Create an RFC or issue describing the change, affected SDKs, rollout order, and timeline.

#### 2. Cross-SDK review period

Allow at least 1 week for all affected SDK team leads to review and comment.

#### 3. Implement with coordination

Follow the [Cross-SDK Coordination Protocol](/sdk/getting-started/standards/coordination-maintenance#cross-sdk-coordination-protocol).

#### 4. Track progress

Create a tracking issue or project board to monitor implementation across SDKs.
