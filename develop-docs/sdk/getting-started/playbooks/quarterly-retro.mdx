title: Quarterly Cross-SDK Retro
---

## Steps

#### 1. Each SDK team answers these questions

(async, written):
- What's the most common low-quality PR pattern we're seeing?
- What's the most annoying friction in our process?
- What standard or playbook is working well?
- What standard or playbook needs updating?
- Any regressions or incidents worth discussing?

#### 2. Compile answers

Into a shared document.

#### 3. Sync meeting

(30 minutes) to discuss cross-cutting themes. Not a status update — focus on patterns that affect multiple teams.

#### 4. Outcomes

Update standards, playbooks, AGENTS.md files, and saved replies based on what was learned.

#### 5. Track across retros

Are the same problems recurring? If so, the fix from last quarter didn't work — try something different.

## Referenced Standards

All — this is the feedback loop.
