    summary: Initial playbook — external PR triage workflow with saved replies and review process
---

<SpecMeta />

## Overview

This playbook guides SDK maintainers through triaging and reviewing pull requests from external contributors. It covers timely triage, linked issue requirements, CI checks, saved replies for common patterns, and review processes for viable PRs. By following these steps, external contributors receive respectful, timely feedback that respects everyone's time.

## Steps

#### 1. Triage within 2 business days

([Review SLAs](/sdk/getting-started/standards/review-ci#review-slas)). Every external PR **REQUIRES** a timely, substantive response.

#### 2. Check for a linked issue

If the PR is non-trivial and has no linked issue, use the **"Open an issue first (behavior/refactor → close)"** [saved reply](/sdk/getting-started/templates/saved-replies#closing-pull-requests):

> <Include name="saved-reply-open-issue-first.mdx" />

Close the PR.

#### 3. Check CI status

If checks are failing, comment specifically on what's broken and give the contributor a chance to fix it.

#### 4. Check for speculative refactors

If the PR is a style-only change or refactor with no linked issue or problem statement, use the **"Let's discuss the approach first (idea → close)"** [saved reply](/sdk/getting-started/templates/saved-replies#closing-pull-requests):

> <Include name="saved-reply-discuss-approach-first.mdx" />

Close the PR.

#### 5. If the PR is viable

Review it using the standard process ([Reviewing a PR](/sdk/getting-started/playbooks/reviewing-a-pr)). If it appears AI-generated, also apply [AI-specific checks](/sdk/getting-started/playbooks/reviewing-ai-generated-code).

#### 6. When requesting changes

You **MUST** be specific, use LOGAF prefixes ([Review feedback conventions](/sdk/getting-started/standards/review-ci#review-feedback-conventions)), and explain *why* — so the contributor (or their AI tool) can address the feedback effectively.

#### 7. Closing fast is kind

A 30-second close with a clear, respectful reason is better than a PR that sits open for weeks with no response. That respects everyone's time.
