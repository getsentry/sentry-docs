title: Handling an External Contributor PR
---

## Steps

#### 1. Triage within 2 business days

([Review SLAs](../standards/review-ci#review-slas)). Every external PR deserves a timely, substantive response.

#### 2. Check for a linked issue

If the PR is non-trivial and has no linked issue, use the saved reply:

> *"Thanks for the contribution! This PR changes behavior without a linked issue or prior discussion. Please open an issue first so we can discuss the approach before investing time in a PR. Closing for now — happy to revisit once there's an issue to reference."*

Close the PR.

#### 3. Check CI status

If checks are failing, comment specifically on what's broken and give the contributor a chance to fix it.

#### 4. Check for speculative refactors

If the PR is a style-only change or refactor with no linked issue or problem statement, use the saved reply:

> *"We don't accept speculative refactors without a linked issue describing the concrete problem being solved. Closing for now — if there's a specific issue this addresses, please open one and we can discuss the approach."*

Close the PR.

#### 5. If the PR is viable

Review it using the standard process ([Reviewing a PR](reviewing-a-pr)). If it appears AI-generated, also apply [AI-specific checks](reviewing-ai-generated-code).

#### 6. When requesting changes

Be specific, use LOGAF prefixes ([Review feedback conventions](../standards/review-ci#review-feedback-conventions)), and explain *why* — so the contributor (or their AI tool) can address the feedback effectively.

#### 7. Closing fast is kind

A 30-second close with a clear, respectful reason is better than a PR that sits open for weeks with no response. That respects everyone's time.
