    summary: Initial playbook — release process with gating criteria and post-release monitoring
---

<SpecRfcAlert />

<SpecMeta />

## Overview

This playbook guides SDK maintainers through cutting a release for an SDK repository. It covers release gating criteria verification, running release tooling (Craft), artifact verification, and post-release monitoring. By following these steps, releases will be high quality, properly monitored, and quickly addressed if regressions occur.

All Sentry SDKs use [Craft](https://github.com/getsentry/craft) for release automation with a two-person approval requirement. The process follows a prepare → publish workflow coordinated through the [getsentry/publish](https://github.com/getsentry/publish) repository.

## Steps

#### 1. Verify release gating criteria

You **MUST** verify all criteria pass ([Release gating criteria](/sdk/getting-started/standards/review-ci#release-gating-criteria)):
- All required CI checks pass on the release branch
- No unresolved `h:` (high) review comments on merged PRs since last release
- Changelog is substantive (not empty or internal-only for a release with user-facing changes)
- No known unresolved regressions

#### 2. Prepare the release

Run the Craft prepare command (command varies by SDK — check your SDK's `CONTRIBUTING.md`):

```bash
# Common pattern across SDKs
craft prepare <version>
# Or via GitHub Actions workflow (trigger manually)
```

This creates a release PR in the [getsentry/publish](https://github.com/getsentry/publish) repository. The PR **MUST** be approved by a second SDK maintainer before proceeding.

#### 3. Publish the release

Once the publish PR is approved, run the Craft publish command:

```bash
craft publish <version>
# Or merge the publish PR to trigger automated publishing
```

Craft will:
- Create a Git tag
- Build and publish artifacts to package registries
- Create a GitHub release with changelog

#### 4. Verify the release artifact

The artifact **MUST** be published and installable. Quick smoke test: install the new version in a clean environment and verify basic functionality.

**Note:** Some SDKs have additional verification steps (example app testing, documentation updates) — check your SDK's release documentation.

#### 5. Post-release monitoring

You **MUST** follow post-release monitoring procedures ([Post-release monitoring](/sdk/getting-started/standards/coordination-maintenance#post-release-monitoring)):
- Check SDK crash detection within 24 hours
- Verify dogfooding (Sentry's own products) picks up the new version
- Monitor the issue tracker for regression reports for 48 hours

#### 6. If a critical regression is found

Trigger the [Handling a Regression](/sdk/getting-started/playbooks/handling-a-regression) process.

## SDK-Specific Variations

While the core process above applies to all Sentry SDKs, individual SDKs **MAY** have additional requirements or tooling variations. You **MUST** consult your SDK's release documentation:

- **sentry-javascript**: See [docs/publishing-a-release.md](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/develop/docs/publishing-a-release.md) for detailed changelog formatting guidelines
- **Other SDKs**: Check the "Releasing" or "Publishing" section in `CONTRIBUTING.md`

Common SDK-specific variations include:
- Changelog generation (manual vs. auto-generated)
- Example app testing requirements
- Documentation PR requirements
- Registry-specific verification steps
