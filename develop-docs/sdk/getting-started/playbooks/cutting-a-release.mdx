title: Cutting a Release
---

## Steps

#### 1. Verify release gating criteria

([Release gating criteria](../standards/review-ci#release-gating-criteria)):
- All required CI checks pass on the release branch
- No unresolved `h:` (high) review comments on merged PRs since last release
- Changelog is substantive (not empty or internal-only for a release with user-facing changes)
- No known unresolved regressions

#### 2. Run the release

Through existing tooling (craft / GitHub Actions release workflow).

#### 3. Verify the release artifact

Is published and installable. Quick smoke test: install the new version in a clean environment.

#### 4. Post-release monitoring

([Post-release monitoring](../standards/coordination-maintenance#post-release-monitoring)):
- Check SDK crash detection within 24 hours
- Verify dogfooding (Sentry's own products) picks up the new version
- Monitor the issue tracker for regression reports for 48 hours

#### 5. If a critical regression is found

Trigger the [regression handling](handling-a-regression) process.
