title: Dropping Platform or Language Version Support
---

## Steps

#### 1. Open an issue with evidence

- Upstream EOL status (has the language/platform version reached end of life?)
- Usage data (what percentage of users are on this version?)
- Maintenance burden (how much effort does supporting this version cost?)

#### 2. Announce deprecation in a minor release

- Changelog entry stating which version will be dropped and when
- Documentation update
- CI continues to test against the deprecated version during this period

#### 3. Wait at least one full minor release cycle

Users need time to see the deprecation and plan their upgrade.

#### 4. Remove in the next major version

- Drop the version from the CI test matrix
- Update documentation (README, docs site)
- Include `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the commit footer ([Breaking change process](../standards/api-architecture#breaking-change-process))

#### 5. Provide migration guidance

"Upgrade to [language/platform] version X.Y or later before upgrading to SDK version N."
