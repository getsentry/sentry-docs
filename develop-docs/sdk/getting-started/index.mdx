## Philosophy

The [values](philosophy/) that shape what we build. Why SDKs exist, what makes a good one, and the design tradeoffs we navigate — trust, compatibility, minimalism, and user impact.

## Principles

Ten working [principles](principles/) for how we collaborate, review, and ship. They translate philosophy into daily decisions: who owns what, when to automate vs. judge, and why small PRs beat big ones.

## Standards

The enforceable rules. Each standard defines what's required, how it's enforced (CI, human review, or tooling), and where per-SDK overrides are allowed.

1. [Planning & Scoping](standards/planning-scoping) - issue quality, design-first gate, AI-assisted planning
2. [Code Submission](standards/code-submission) - commits, branches, PRs, changelogs, AI attribution
3. [Code Quality](standards/code-quality) - linting, testing, dependencies, security
4. [API & Architecture](standards/api-architecture) - public API gates, server-vs-SDK, breaking changes
5. [Review & CI](standards/review-ci) - reviewers, SLAs, LOGAF feedback, CI baseline
6. [Repository & Documentation](standards/repository-docs) - AGENTS.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, docs-with-code
7. [Coordination & Maintenance](standards/coordination-maintenance) - cross-SDK protocol, triaging, releases

## Playbooks

Step-by-step workflows for common scenarios. Each [playbook](playbooks/) references the [standards](#standards) it operationalizes, so you can trace any step back to a rule.
