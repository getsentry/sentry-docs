title: Principles
description: These working principles govern how SDK teams collaborate, review, and ship. They build on the SDK philosophy, which governs what we build and how our SDKs should behave. Where a philosophy principle has direct implications for how we work, it is referenced below.

## Every line has an owner

Whether code is written by a human, an AI tool, or a collaboration, a human is accountable for every line that merges. The author's name on the PR is the owner. "The AI suggested it" is never a justification in review.

## Raise the floor

Guidelines exist to make the minimum quality of all contributions higher — internal and external, human and AI-assisted. A rising floor is more valuable than a rising ceiling.

## Automate the obvious, judge the nuanced

If a rule can be checked by a machine, it must be checked by a machine. Human review time is the scarcest resource on the team — reserve it for decisions that require judgment: architecture, API design, user impact.

## Discussion before implementation

For non-trivial changes, agree on the approach before writing code. This applies to internal engineers as much as external contributors. An issue or RFC before a PR. This is more important in the AI era, not less — generating code is cheap, but generating the wrong code wastes reviewer time.

## Tests prove behavior, not coverage

Tests exist to verify the SDK does what users expect. A test that asserts nothing meaningful is worse than no test — it creates false confidence. This matters doubly for AI-generated tests, which frequently look correct but verify nothing.

## Document the why

Code shows what. Commit messages, PR descriptions, and design docs explain why. This context is essential for future humans and AI tools working in the codebase. A commit with no explanation is a debt on every future reader.

## Consistency across SDKs, idiom within each

Users of multiple Sentry SDKs should recognize the same concepts, behaviors, and terminology. But each SDK should feel native to its language and ecosystem. Cross-SDK standards define the concept; per-SDK standards define the expression.

## Ship small

Small changes are easier to review, easier to revert, and easier for AI tools to generate correctly. Prefer multiple small PRs over one large one. A PR that does one thing well is worth more than a PR that does three things adequately.

## Every change needs a reason

Changes must solve a real problem. No speculative refactors, no "improvements" without a linked issue or measurable benefit. This gives engineers standing to reject changes — from humans or AI tools — that lack clear motivation. See [Customer Value Matters](../philosophy/index#customer-value-matters) for more information.

## If it's not written, it's not a rule

If you expect engineers (or AI tools) to follow a practice, it must be in a document that's discoverable and machine-readable. Verbal norms and tribal knowledge don't scale, and AI tools can't read them at all. See [Write Down the Rules](../philosophy/index#write-down-the-rules) for more information.
