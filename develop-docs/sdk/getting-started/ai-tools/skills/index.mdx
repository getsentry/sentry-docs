## Skills Package Manager (dotagents)

We've launched a package manager for .agents directories that enables you to declare agent skill dependencies in `agents.toml`, lock versions for reproducibility, and allow every tool on your team to reliably discover skills from a unified location.

### Sentry Reproduction Skill (repro)

This skill enables agents and developers to quickly generate, store, and share minimal reproduction environments for issues affecting Sentry SDKs and integrations. It automates the creation of reproducible test cases in isolated sandboxes, streamlining bug reporting, verification, and collaborative debugging across the Sentry ecosystem. This skill improves issue turnaround and makes it easier to validate fixes or demonstrate regressions in a consistent environment.
