## Required reviewers

#### Rule

Every PR requires at least one approving review. Senior/lead review required for: public API ([Public API change approval gate](api-architecture#public-api-change-approval-gate)), new dependencies ([Dependency management](code-quality#dependency-management)), security-sensitive code ([Security practices](code-quality#security-practices)), schema changes, new frameworks/architectural shifts. External contributor PRs require review from someone with area context.

#### Enforcement

GitHub branch protection + CODEOWNERS.

#### Suggested skill(s)

- [`sentry-skills:code-review`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills?tab=readme-ov-file#available-skills)

#### Per-SDK override

CODEOWNERS and reviewer count are team-specific.

---

## Review SLAs

#### Rule

Internal PRs: first review within 1 business day. External PRs: first response within 2 business days. "First review" = substantive feedback, not just a reaction. 
If there is only a single maintainer or reviewer for a given area or lacks capacity, you must proactively find coverage (another reviewer or AI assist); the PR author shares responsibility for identifying an appropriate reviewer to avoid blocking the PR.

#### Enforcement

Dashboard tracking. Periodic reporting.

#### Suggested skill(s)

—

#### Per-SDK override

Teams can set stricter SLAs. Baselines are universal.

---

## Review feedback conventions

#### Rule

LOGAF scale: `h:` (high) — must fix (bugs, security, breakage, data loss). `m:` (medium) — should fix (design, missing tests, clarity). `l:` (low) — optional nit (style, minor suggestions). No prefix defaults to medium. Blocking requires at least one `h:`.

#### Enforcement

Convention.

#### Suggested skill(s)

- [`sentry-skills:iterate-pr`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills?tab=readme-ov-file#available-skills) — triages by LOGAF level.
- [`sentry-skills:code-review`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills?tab=readme-ov-file#available-skills) — uses LOGAF in feedback.

#### Per-SDK override

No.

## Required CI checks baseline

#### Rule

Every SDK repo must have as required status checks: 1) Build, 2) Lint ([Linting and formatting in CI](code-quality#linting-and-formatting-in-ci)), 3) Type check where applicable ([Type checking in CI](code-quality#type-checking-in-ci)), 4) Tests, 5) Commit message format ([Commit message format](code-submission#commit-message-format)). Optional/recommended: size/perf check ([SDK size and performance budgets](code-quality#sdk-size-and-performance-budgets)), API surface snapshot ([Public API change approval gate](api-architecture#public-api-change-approval-gate)), changelog check ([Changelog entry](code-submission#changelog-entry)), secret scanning ([Security practices](code-quality#security-practices)).

#### Enforcement

GitHub branch protection.

#### Suggested skill(s)

- [`sentry-skills:claude-settings-audit`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills?tab=readme-ov-file#available-skills)

#### Per-SDK override

Additional checks per SDK. Baseline is universal.

---

## Release gating criteria

#### Rule

A release must not ship if: any required CI check fails, unresolved `h:` comments on merged PRs since last release, changelog empty for user-facing changes, known unresolved regression.

#### Enforcement

Release tooling checks. Human judgment for regressions.

#### Suggested skill(s)

—

#### Per-SDK override

Additional gates per SDK (e.g., beta/rc periods).
