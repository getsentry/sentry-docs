## Required Reviewers

#### Rule

Every PR requires at least one approving review.
@sdk-leads review required for: 
* Public API ([Public API change approval gate](/sdk/getting-started/standards/api-architecture#public-api-change-approval-gate))
* New dependencies ([Dependency management](/sdk/getting-started/standards/code-quality#dependency-management))
* Security-sensitive code ([Security practices](/sdk/getting-started/standards/code-quality#security-practices))
* Schema changes
* Frameworks/architectural shifts.
External contributor PRs require review from someone with area context.

#### Enforcement

* GitHub branch protection
* CODEOWNERS file

#### Suggested Skill(s)

* [`sentry-skills:code-review`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills#available-skills)

#### Per-SDK Override

<StatusBadge type="yes" />  CODEOWNERS and reviewer count are team-specific.

---

## Review SLAs

#### Rule

Internal PRs: first review within 1 business day. 
External PRs: first response within 2 business days.

"First review" = substantive feedback, not just a reaction. 

If there is only a single maintainer or reviewer for a given area or lacks capacity, proactively find coverage (another reviewer or AI assist); the PR author shares responsibility for identifying an appropriate reviewer to avoid blocking the PR.

#### Enforcement

* Dashboard tracking
* Periodic reporting

#### Per-SDK Override

<StatusBadge type="yes" /> Teams can set stricter SLAs. Baselines are universal.

---

## Review Feedback Conventions

#### Rule

LOGAF scale: 
* `h:` (high) — must fix (bugs, security, breakage, data loss)
* `m:` (medium) — should fix (design, missing tests, clarity)
* `l:` (low) — optional nit (style, minor suggestions)

No prefix defaults to medium. Blocking requires at least one `h:`.

#### Enforcement

* Convention

#### Suggested Skill(s)

* [`sentry-skills:iterate-pr`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills#available-skills) — triages by LOGAF level.
* [`sentry-skills:code-review`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills#available-skills) — uses LOGAF in feedback.

#### Per-SDK Override

<StatusBadge type="no" />

## Required CI Checks Baseline

#### Rule

Every SDK repo must have as required status checks: 

1. Build
2. Lint ([Linting and formatting in CI](/sdk/getting-started/standards/code-quality#linting-and-formatting-in-ci))
3. Type check where applicable ([Type checking in CI](/sdk/getting-started/standards/code-quality#type-checking-in-ci))
4. Tests
5. Commit message format ([Commit message format](/sdk/getting-started/standards/code-submission#commit-message-format)).

Optional/recommended:
* Size/Performance Check ([SDK size and performance budgets](/sdk/getting-started/standards/code-quality#sdk-size-and-performance-budgets))
* API Surface Snapshot ([Public API change approval gate](/sdk/getting-started/standards/api-architecture#public-api-change-approval-gate))
* Changelog Check ([Changelog entry](/sdk/getting-started/standards/code-submission#changelog-entry))
* Secret Scanning ([Security practices](/sdk/getting-started/standards/code-quality#security-practices)).

#### Enforcement

* GitHub branch protection

#### Suggested Skill(s)

* [`sentry-skills:claude-settings-audit`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills?tab=readme-ov-file#available-skills)

#### Per-SDK Override

<StatusBadge type="no" /> Additional checks per SDK. Baseline is universal.

---

## Release Gating Criteria

#### Rule

A release must not ship if: 
* any required CI check fails
* unresolved `h:` comments on merged PRs since last release
* changelog empty for user-facing changes
* known unresolved regression

#### Enforcement

* Release tooling checks
* Human judgment for regressions

#### Per-SDK Override

<StatusBadge type="no" /> Additional gates per SDK possible (e.g., beta/rc periods).
