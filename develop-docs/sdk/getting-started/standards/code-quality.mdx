## Linting and formatting in CI

#### Rule

Every SDK repo must have automated linting and formatting in CI. Code that doesn't pass doesn't merge. No exceptions.

#### Enforcement

CI required status check (language-specific linters).

#### Suggested skill(s)

- [`sentry-skills:claude-settings-audit`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills?tab=readme-ov-file#available-skills) - detects tech stack and recommends linter configuration.

#### Per-SDK override

Yes - linter choice, rules, strictness. The standard is that a linter exists and is enforced.

---

## Type checking in CI

#### Rule

For languages with mainstream static type checking (TypeScript, Python with mypy/pyright, Java, Kotlin, C#, Go, Rust), type checking is a required CI check.

#### Enforcement

CI required status check.

#### Per-SDK override

Yes - configuration and strictness. Gradual typing allowed with a tracked plan.

---

## Test requirements by change type

#### Rule

* **Bug fix** → regression test (fails without fix, passes with it).
* **New feature** → unit tests + integration tests where applicable.
* **Refactor** → existing tests pass; no new tests required unless coverage was missing.
* **Performance change** → benchmark or measurable evidence.
* **Breaking change** → update/remove old tests, add new tests.

#### Enforcement

Human review. AGENTS.md instruction.

#### Suggested skill(s)

- [`sentry-skills:code-review`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills?tab=readme-ov-file#available-skills) - includes test coverage in checklist.
- [`sentry-skills:find-bugs`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills?tab=readme-ov-file#available-skills) - identifies untested paths.

#### Per-SDK override

Yes - test categories and boundaries are SDK-specific.

---

## Test quality

#### Rule

Tests must assert meaningful behavior: assertions that would fail if the tested behavior broke, not just "no exception thrown" unless that's the behavior under test, snapshot tests reviewed for correctness not auto-accepted, AI-generated tests get extra scrutiny (watch for hardcoded values, implementation-detail testing, tests that pass regardless).

#### Enforcement

Human review. AGENTS.md: "Every test must answer: what user-visible behavior would break if this test were deleted?"

#### Suggested skill(s)

- [`sentry-skills:code-review`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills?tab=readme-ov-file#available-skills)
- [`sentry-skills:find-bugs`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills?tab=readme-ov-file#available-skills)

#### Per-SDK override

No - principle is universal. Language-specific anti-patterns documented per-SDK in AGENTS.md.

---

## Dependency management

#### Rule

New dependency requires explicit justification in the PR description. Dependencies pinned to a version range (not floating). Transitive dependency behavior changes get same scrutiny as direct additions. Quarterly dependency audit minimum.

#### Enforcement

Human review. CI detection of new dependency manifest entries.

#### Suggested skill(s)

- [`sentry-skills:security-review`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills?tab=readme-ov-file#available-skills)

#### Per-SDK override

Yes - tooling varies. Approval requirement is universal.

---

## SDK size and performance budgets

#### Rule

Each SDK defines and tracks: package/binary size budget, initialization time budget, memory overhead budget (where applicable).

#### Enforcement

CI check where feasible (size comparison, benchmarks). Advisory initially, path toward blocking.

#### Suggested skill(s)

-

#### Per-SDK override

Yes - entirely. Budgets and measurement are SDK-specific. The standard is that budgets exist and are tracked.

---

## Security practices

#### Rule

No secrets, credentials, or PII in code or commits. Data handling follows the [data handling spec](/sdk/04-sdk-features/data-handling/). Security-sensitive changes require explicit review from someone with security context. Vulnerability patch SLAs: critical 48h, high 1 week, medium next release.

#### Enforcement

CI secret scanning. Human review.

#### Suggested skill(s)

- [`sentry-skills:security-review`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills?tab=readme-ov-file#available-skills)
- [`sentry-skills:find-bugs`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills?tab=readme-ov-file#available-skills)

#### Per-SDK override

Vulnerability SLAs can be adjusted. Data handling requirements are universal.
