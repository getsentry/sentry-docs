## Linting and Formatting in CI

#### Rule

Every SDK repo **MUST** have automated linting and formatting in CI. Code that doesn't pass **MUST NOT** merge. There are no exceptions to this requirement.

#### Enforcement

- CI required status check (language-specific linters)

#### Suggested skill(s)

- [`sentry-skills:claude-settings-audit`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills#available-skills) - detects tech stack and recommends linter configuration.

#### Per-SDK override

<StatusBadge type="yes" /> Linter choice, rules, strictness. The standard is
that a linter exists and is enforced.

---

## Type Checking in CI

#### Rule

Type checking is **REQUIRED** in CI for:

- All statically typed languages (Java, Kotlin, Swift, C#, Go, Rust, Dart)
- Dynamically typed languages with an established type-checking ecosystem (TypeScript, Python, PHP, Elixir)

Dynamically typed languages without an established type-checking system (e.g., Ruby) are TBD or **MAY** be exempt with a valid reason.

#### Enforcement

- CI required status check

#### Per-SDK override

<StatusBadge type="yes" /> Configuration and strictness. Gradual typing allowed
with a tracked plan.

---

## Test Requirements by Change Type

#### Rule

- **Bug fix**: regression test (fails without fix, passes with it).
- **New feature**: unit tests + integration tests where applicable.
- **Refactor**: existing tests pass; no new tests required unless coverage was missing.
- **Performance change**: benchmark or measurable evidence.
- **Breaking change**: update/remove old tests, add new tests.

#### Enforcement

- AGENTS.md instruction
- Human review

#### Suggested skill(s)

- [`sentry-skills:code-review`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills#available-skills) - includes test coverage in checklist
- [`sentry-skills:find-bugs`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills#available-skills) - identifies untested paths

#### Per-SDK override

<StatusBadge type="yes" /> Test categories and boundaries are SDK-specific.

---

## Test Quality

#### Rule

Tests **MUST** assert meaningful behavior:

- Assertions **MUST** fail if the tested behavior breaks
- "No exception thrown" assertions are only acceptable when exception handling is the behavior being tested
- Snapshot tests **MUST** be reviewed for correctness, not auto-accepted
- AI-generated tests **REQUIRE** extra scrutiny for:
  - Hardcoded values
  - Implementation-detail testing
  - Tests that pass regardless of behavior

#### Enforcement

- AGENTS.md: "Every test must answer: what user-visible behavior would break if this test were deleted?"
- Human review

#### Suggested skill(s)

- [`sentry-skills:code-review`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills#available-skills)
- [`sentry-skills:find-bugs`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills#available-skills)

#### Per-SDK override

<StatusBadge type="no" /> Principle is universal. Language-specific
anti-patterns documented per-SDK in AGENTS.md.

---

## Dependency Management

#### Rule

- New dependency **REQUIRES** explicit justification in the PR description
- Dependencies **MUST** be pinned to a version range (not floating versions)
- Transitive dependency behavior changes **MUST** receive the same scrutiny as direct dependency additions
- Dependency audits **MUST** be conducted quarterly at minimum

#### Enforcement

- CI detection of new dependency manifest entries
- Human review

#### Suggested skill(s)

- [`sentry-skills:security-review`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills#available-skills)

See also: [Adding a Dependency](/sdk/getting-started/playbooks/adding-a-dependency) for the step-by-step approval and evaluation workflow.

#### Per-SDK override

<StatusBadge type="yes" /> Tooling varies. Approval requirement is universal.

---

## SDK Size and Performance Budgets

#### Rule

Each SDK **MUST** define and track:

- Package/binary size budget
- Initialization time budget
- Memory overhead budget (where applicable)

#### Enforcement

- CI check where feasible (size comparison, benchmarks); advisory initially, path toward blocking

#### Per-SDK override

<StatusBadge type="yes" /> Budgets and measurement are SDK-specific. The
standard is that budgets exist and are tracked.

---

## Security Practices

#### Rule

No secrets, credentials, or PII in code or commits. Data handling follows the [data handling spec](/sdk/expected-features/data-handling/). Security-sensitive changes **REQUIRE** explicit review from someone with security context. Vulnerability patch SLAs: critical 48h, high 1 week, medium next release. Dependency vulnerability alerts **MUST NOT** be ignored or silently dismissed.

#### Enforcement

- CI secret scanning
- Dependency scanning (GitHub Security Advisories / Dependabot alerts)
- Human review

#### Suggested skill(s)

- [`sentry-skills:security-review`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills#available-skills)
- [`sentry-skills:find-bugs`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills#available-skills)

#### Per-SDK override

<StatusBadge type="yes" /> Vulnerability SLAs can be adjusted. Data handling requirements are universal.
