## Version Format

<SpecSection id="version-format" status="candidate" since="1.0.0">

#### Rule

All SDK versions **MUST** follow [semantic versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/):

```
<major>.<minor>.<patch>(-<prerelease>)?(-<build>)?
```

Major, minor, and patch are **REQUIRED**. Pre-release and build identifiers are **OPTIONAL** and can be combined.

#### Enforcement

- [Craft](https://github.com/getsentry/craft) validates version format at release time.

#### Per-SDK override

<StatusBadge type="no" /> Format is universal. Language-specific conventions
around SemVer (if applicable) are allowed.

</SpecSection>

---

## Pre-Release Identifiers

<SpecSection id="pre-release-identifiers" status="candidate" since="1.0.0">

#### Rule

Pre-release identifiers **MUST** be one of: `preview`, `pre`, `rc`, `dev`, `alpha`, `beta`, `unstable`, `a`, `b`. Arbitrary strings are not accepted.

Pre-releases:

- Do not receive a `latest` tag in package registries
- Are not inserted into the internal release-registry (used by Sentry product, docs, and tooling)

Valid examples:

```
1.0.0-preview
1.0.0-alpha.0
1.0.0-beta.1
1.0.0-rc.20
```

Invalid (treated as stable):

```
1.0.0-foo
1.0.0-canary.0
```

**Python post-releases:** Python has the concept of post-releases indicated by a numeric-only suffix (e.g., `1.0.0-1`). Since this doesn't match any valid pre-release identifier, craft treats post-releases as stable releases.

#### Enforcement

- Craft rejects unrecognized identifiers or treats them as stable releases.

#### Per-SDK override

<StatusBadge type="no" />

</SpecSection>

---

## Build Identifiers

<SpecSection id="build-identifiers" status="candidate" since="1.0.0">

#### Rule

Build identifiers **MAY** be appended for platform or architecture variants. When combined with pre-release identifiers, the pre-release **MUST** come first.

Valid examples:

```
1.0.0+x86_64
1.0.0-rc.1+x86_64
```

Invalid:

```
1.0.0+rc.1+x86_64
1.0.0+x86_64-beta.0
```

#### Enforcement

- Craft validates format at release time.

#### Per-SDK override

<StatusBadge type="yes" /> Usage depends on whether the SDK publishes
platform-specific artifacts.

</SpecSection>

---

## Release Tooling

<SpecSection id="release-tooling" status="candidate" since="1.0.0">

#### Rule

SDKs **MUST** use [craft](https://github.com/getsentry/craft) for release preparation and [publish](https://github.com/getsentry/publish) for release approval. Every SDK repo **MUST** have:

- `.craft.yml` — release configuration
- `scripts/bump-version.sh` — version bump script invoked by craft
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` — GitHub Actions workflow to trigger releases

See the [setting up release infrastructure](/sdk/getting-started/playbooks/setup/setting-up-release-infrastructure) playbook for setup instructions.

#### Enforcement

- Craft enforces configuration at release time.
- Publish requires approval label before artifacts are published.

#### Per-SDK override

<StatusBadge type="yes" /> Craft targets and bump-version logic are
SDK-specific. Toolchain is universal.

</SpecSection>

---

## Merge Target

<SpecSection id="merge-target" status="candidate" since="1.0.0">

#### Rule

By default, releases are merged to the repository's default branch (usually `main`). To override this, pass the `merge_target` input in the release workflow:

```yaml
- name: Prepare release
  uses: getsentry/craft@v2
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ steps.token.outputs.token }}
  with:
    version: ${{ github.event.inputs.version }}
    merge_target: ${{ github.event.inputs.merge_target }}
```

Add a corresponding `merge_target` input to the workflow's `workflow_dispatch.inputs` block. The same input is available in the [reusable workflow](https://craft.sentry.dev/github-actions/#option-1-reusable-workflow-recommended).

#### Enforcement

- Craft handles branch targeting at release time.

#### Per-SDK override

<StatusBadge type="yes" /> Depends on branching strategy.

</SpecSection>

---

## Multiple Craft Configs Per Repository

<SpecSection id="multiple-craft-configs" status="candidate" since="1.0.0">

#### Rule

When a repository maintains multiple major versions (e.g., v7 and v8) with diverging publishing targets, it can opt into using the `.craft.yml` from the merge target branch instead of the default branch.

**Release preparation:** Add `craft_config_from_merge_target: true` when calling `getsentry/craft` in the release workflow:

```yaml
- name: Prepare release
  uses: getsentry/craft@v2
  with:
    craft_config_from_merge_target: true
```

This input is also available in the [reusable workflow](https://craft.sentry.dev/github-actions/#option-1-reusable-workflow-recommended).

**Publish configuration:** Register the branch in the `publish.yml` workflow in `getsentry/publish`:

```yaml
- name: Set target repo checkout branch
  if: |
    fromJSON(steps.inputs.outputs.result).repo == 'sentry-javascript' && fromJSON(steps.inputs.outputs.result).merge_target == 'v7'
```

The registered branches **MUST** be protected in the target repository — disable direct pushing and require PR approvals before merging.

#### Enforcement

- Craft validates config from the specified branch.
- Publish workflow enforces branch protection requirement.

#### Per-SDK override

<StatusBadge type="yes" /> Only needed for repos maintaining multiple major versions.
