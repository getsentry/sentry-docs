## Server-side (Relay) vs. SDK-side decision gate

#### Rule

New processing or transformation logic **MUST** default to server-side (Relay).

Logic **SHOULD** only be implemented in the SDK when it meets one of these criteria:

- **MUST** run before data leaves the customer's application (e.g., user-controlled filtering like `before_send_*`)
- **REQUIRES** access to platform-specific APIs
- Is strictly latency-sensitive
- **MUST** function in offline scenarios

Transformations of data that has already been collected should be handled in Relay. This ensures consistency across SDK versions and avoids duplicating logic in clients that may remain in use indefinitely.

#### Enforcement

- AGENTS.md instruction
- Human review

#### Per-SDK override

<StatusBadge type="no" /> The default is universal. Justifications are
SDK-specific.

---

## SDK-side logic must not break on server changes

#### Rule

SDKs typically outlive individual API versions, so forward compatibility is essential to prevent ecosystem breakage.

SDKs **MUST** remain resilient to evolving server responses:

- Additional fields
- Missing optional fields
- New enum values
- Rate limiting

They **MUST NOT** fail due to additive changes. Unknown fields, categories, or dimensions **SHOULD** be safely ignored rather than causing errors.

#### Enforcement

- Integration tests for degraded server scenarios (additional fields, missing optional fields, new enum values, rate limiting)
- Human review

#### Per-SDK override

<StatusBadge type="yes" /> Specific tests vary. Principle is universal.

---

## Public API change approval gate

#### Rule

Any change to public API (add, change, deprecate, remove) **REQUIRES** @sdk-leads approval. Public API includes anything a user can call, import, configure, subclass, or otherwise reference. If there is any doubt whether something is public, check for usage in public repositories using the SDK. When still unsure, treat it as public.

#### Enforcement

- CI API snapshot diffs (where feasible)
- Human review gate (@sdk-leads approval)

#### Suggested skill(s)

- [`sentry-skills:code-review`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills#available-skills) — flags API changes for escalation.

#### Per-SDK override

<StatusBadge type="yes" /> Detection mechanisms are language-specific. Approval
requirement is universal.

---

## Semantic conventions process

#### Rule

New attributes **MUST** first be defined in [sentry-conventions](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-conventions).
Process:

1. PR to sentry-conventions
2. code owner approval
3. 3 business day minimum wait
4. SDK implementation

#### Enforcement

- CI validation where feasible
- Human review

#### Per-SDK override

<StatusBadge type="no" />

---

## Breaking change process

#### Rule

Breaking changes **MUST** follow the breaking changes playbook.

Breaking changes **MAY** only ship in a major version. They **MUST NOT** ship in minor versions. Opt-in previews are allowed in minor versions.

A deprecation period is **REQUIRED** in a prior minor version, during which dual behavior is allowed to support migration.

Every breaking change **MUST** include:

- A migration guide with copy-pastable examples
- A changelog entry using the BREAKING CHANGE: notation
- Validation of the migration guide using an LLM to ensure it is clear and complete

#### Enforcement

- [Commit footer BREAKING CHANGE:](/engineering-practices/commit-messages/#footer) triggers CI checks
- Breaking changes in non-major branches are CI-blocked
- Human review

#### Suggested skill(s)

- [`sentry-skills:code-review`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills#available-skills)

#### Per-SDK override

<StatusBadge type="yes" /> Deprecation period timelines can vary. Process is
universal.

---

## Deprecation lifecycle

#### Rule

All deprecations of public APIs, user-facing integrations, and supported platforms or frameworks follow three stages:

1. Announce in a minor release with a runtime warning (where possible), updated changelog and documentation, and a migration guide. Warnings **MUST** include the replacement, a code example, and a link to the migration docs.
2. Keep the deprecated surface fully functional for at least one subsequent minor release (e.g., deprecated in X.Y, still supported in X.(Y+1)).
3. Remove only in the next major release (X+1.0).

Deprecating an entire SDK **MUST NOT** be silent. It **REQUIRES** clear customer impact analysis, a public announcement, updated documentation, a defined support timeline, and advance EOL notice.

#### Enforcement

- CI checks deprecated APIs still have passing tests
- Human review

#### Per-SDK override

<StatusBadge type="yes" /> Minimum period can be extended. Stages are universal.
