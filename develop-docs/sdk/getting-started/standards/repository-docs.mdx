## AGENTS.md

#### Rule

Every SDK repo must have `AGENTS.md` covering: architecture overview, testing conventions, build instructions, contribution expectations, commit attribution convention ([AI attribution](code-submission#ai-attribution)), SDK-specific standard overrides. Updated in same PR as architectural changes.

#### Enforcement

CI file existence check. Human review for staleness.

#### Suggested skill(s)

- [`sentry-skills:agents-md`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills?tab=readme-ov-file#available-skills)

#### Per-SDK override

Content is SDK-specific. Requirement is universal.

---

## CONTRIBUTING.md

#### Rule

Every SDK repo must have `CONTRIBUTING.md` with: setup instructions, development workflow, explicit quality bar, discussion-first policy, AI tools section.

#### Enforcement

CI file existence check. Content quality is human-reviewed.

#### Suggested skill(s)

—

#### Per-SDK override

Setup/workflow are SDK-specific. Quality bar and AI sections use shared template.

---

## PR template

#### Rule

Every SDK repo must have a GitHub PR template with description structure guidance and linked-issue reminder. Not rigid sections — guidance for good free-form descriptions.

#### Enforcement

File existence.

#### Suggested skill(s)

- [`sentry-skills:create-pr`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills?tab=readme-ov-file#available-skills)

#### Per-SDK override

Wording varies. Linked-issue prompt is universal.

---

## Documentation-with-code

#### Rule

User-facing changes require corresponding docs: new feature → docs PR to sentry-docs, behavior change → docs update, deprecation → migration guide ([Deprecation lifecycle](api-architecture#deprecation-lifecycle)), new config option → docs entry. SDK PR links to docs PR. Neither merges without the other being at least approved.

#### Enforcement

Human review. AGENTS.md instruction.

#### Suggested skill(s)

—

#### Per-SDK override

No.

---

## AI context file maintenance

#### Rule

AI context files (AGENTS.md, `.cursorrules`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, CLAUDE.md) are living documentation: updated with architectural changes, reviewed quarterly, periodically tested by having an AI tool attempt a contribution.

#### Enforcement

Human review. Quarterly review reminder.

#### Suggested skill(s)

- [`sentry-skills:agents-md`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills?tab=readme-ov-file#available-skills)

#### Per-SDK override

Which files exist varies. AGENTS.md is required ([AGENTS.md required](repository-docs#agentsmd-required)); others recommended.
