## AGENTS.md

#### Rule

Every SDK repo must have `AGENTS.md` covering: 
* Architecture overview
* Testing conventions
* Build instructions
* Contribution expectations
* Commit attribution convention ([AI attribution](/sdk/getting-started/standards//code-submission#ai-attribution))
* SDK-specific standard overrides -  updated in same PR as architectural changes

#### Enforcement

* CI file existence check
* Human review for staleness

#### Suggested Skill(s)

* [`sentry-skills:agents-md`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills#available-skills)

#### Per-SDK Override

<StatusBadge type="yes" /> Content is SDK-specific. Requirement is universal.

---

## CONTRIBUTING.md

#### Rule

Every SDK repo must have `CONTRIBUTING.md` covering:
* Setup instructions
* Development workflow
* Explicit quality bar
* Discussion-first policy
* AI tools section

#### Enforcement

* CI file existence check
* AGENT.md for update checking
* Content quality is human-reviewed.

#### Per-SDK Override

<StatusBadge type="yes" /> Setup/workflow are SDK-specific. Quality bar and AI sections use shared template.

---

## PR Template

#### Rule

Every SDK repo must have a GitHub PR template with description structure guidance and linked-issue reminder. Not rigid sections — guidance for good free-form descriptions.

#### Enforcement

* File existence.

#### Suggested Skill(s)

* [`sentry-skills:create-pr`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills#available-skills)

#### Per-SDK Override

<StatusBadge type="yes" /> Wording varies. Linked-issue prompt is universal.

---

## Documentation-with-Code

#### Rule

User-facing changes require corresponding docs: 
* **New feature**: Docs PR to [sentry-docs](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-docs/)
* **Behavior change**: Docs update,
* **Deprecation** Migration guide ([Deprecation lifecycle](/sdk/getting-started/standards/api-architecture#deprecation-lifecycle))
* **New config option**: Docs entry

SDK PR links to docs PR. Neither merges without the other being at least approved.

#### Enforcement

* AGENTS.md instruction
* Human review

#### Per-SDK Override

<StatusBadge type="no" />

---

## AI Context File Maintenance

#### Rule

AI context files (AGENTS.md, `.cursorrules`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, CLAUDE.md) are living documentation: updated with architectural changes, reviewed quarterly, periodically tested by having an AI tool attempt a contribution.

#### Enforcement

* Human review
* Quarterly review reminder

#### Suggested Skill(s)

* [`sentry-skills:agents-md`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills#available-skills)

#### Per-SDK Override

<StatusBadge type="yes" /> Which files exist varies. AGENTS.md is required ([AGENTS.md required](#agentsmd)); others recommended.
