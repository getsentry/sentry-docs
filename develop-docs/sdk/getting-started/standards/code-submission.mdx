## Commit message format

#### Rule

Conventional commit format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Header** (max 100 chars total):
- **Type**: one of `feat`, `fix`, `ref`, `perf`, `docs`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `style`, `meta`, `license`.
- **Subject**: imperative mood, capitalize first letter, no trailing period, max 70 chars

**Body**: explain what and why, not how.

**Footer** (one or more of):
- Issue references: `Fixes SENTRY-1234`, `Fixes GH-1234`, `Refs LINEAR-ABC-123`
- Breaking change notices: `BREAKING CHANGE:`
- AI attribution (see [AI attribution](#ai-attribution))

#### Enforcement

[commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) in CI.

#### Suggested skill(s)

- [`sentry-skills:commit`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills?tab=readme-ov-file#available-skills)

#### Per-SDK override

Scope values are SDK-specific.

---

## Branch naming

#### Rule

`<type>/<short-description>` (e.g., `feat/add-client-reports`, `fix/rate-limit-parsing`).

#### Enforcement

CI advisory (non-blocking).

#### Suggested skill(s)

- [`sentry-skills:commit`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills?tab=readme-ov-file#available-skills) - creates branches in this format.

#### Per-SDK override

No.

---

## PR description quality

#### Rule

Every PR must include a description with: what the PR does, why these changes are being made, links to relevant issues or tickets (required for non-trivial changes; typo and one-line doc fixes exempt), alternative approaches considered (if any), additional context reviewers need. No test plan sections, no checkbox lists, no boilerplate. The tests in the diff are the test plan. Blank descriptions, template-only descriptions, and AI-generated filler are not acceptable. PR descriptions must not include any customer data or sensitive information.

#### Enforcement

PR template + CI bot check (non-empty, issue reference present, override via `trivial` label).

#### Suggested skill(s)

- [`sentry-skills:create-pr`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills?tab=readme-ov-file#available-skills)

#### Per-SDK override

Template wording can vary. Linked-issue and non-empty requirements are universal.

---

## PR draft mode

#### Rule

PRs are created as drafts. Mark ready when CI passes and description is complete.

#### Enforcement

Convention + AGENTS.md.

#### Suggested skill(s)

- [`sentry-skills:create-pr`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills?tab=readme-ov-file#available-skills) - uses `--draft` by default.

#### Per-SDK override

No.

---

## Changelog entry

#### Rule

User-facing changes (`feat`, `fix`, `perf`, breaking) require a changelog entry. Internal changes exempt. Override with `skip-changelog` label.

#### Enforcement

CI check.

#### Suggested skill(s)

-

#### Per-SDK override

Format and location vary. Requirement is universal.

---

## One logical change per PR

#### Rule

Each PR does one thing. A bug fix doesn't include a refactor. A new feature doesn't reorganize imports.

#### Enforcement

Human review + AGENTS.md. CI advisory for size.

#### Suggested skill(s)

- [`sentry-skills:code-review`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills?tab=readme-ov-file#available-skills)

#### Per-SDK override

Size thresholds are SDK-specific.

---

## AI attribution

#### Rule

AI-generated changes get `Co-Authored-By` in commit footer (e.g., `Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`). This is the only AI involvement indicator. No "Generated by AI" or similar markers anywhere.

#### Enforcement

AGENTS.md instruction.

#### Suggested skill(s)

- [`sentry-skills:commit`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills?tab=readme-ov-file#available-skills) - adds attribution automatically.
- [`sentry-skills:agents-md`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills?tab=readme-ov-file#available-skills) - ensures AGENTS.md includes the convention.

#### Per-SDK override

No.
