## Commit message format

#### Rule

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Header** (max 100 chars total):

- **Type**: one of `feat`, `fix`, `ref`, `perf`, `docs`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `style`, `meta`, `license`.
- **Subject**: imperative mood, capitalize first letter, no trailing period, max 70 chars

**Body**: explain what and why, not how.

**Footer** (one or more of):

- Issue references: `Fixes SENTRY-1234`, `Fixes GH-1234`, `Refs LINEAR-ABC-123`
- Breaking change notices: `BREAKING CHANGE:`
- AI attribution (see [AI attribution](#ai-attribution))

For additional context on commit message best practices, see [Commit Messages](/engineering-practices/commit-messages/).

#### Enforcement

- [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) in CI

#### Suggested skill(s)

- [`sentry-skills:commit`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills#available-skills)

#### Per-SDK override

<StatusBadge type="no" /> Scope values are SDK-specific.

---

## Branch naming

#### Rule

`<type>/<short-description>` (e.g., `feat/add-client-reports`, `fix/rate-limit-parsing`).

#### Enforcement

- CI advisory (non-blocking)

#### Suggested skill(s)

- [`sentry-skills:commit`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills#available-skills)

#### Per-SDK override

<StatusBadge type="no" />

---

## PR description quality

#### Rule

Every PR **MUST** include a description with:

- What the PR does
- Why these changes are being made
- Links to relevant issues or tickets (**REQUIRED** except for typo fixes and one-line doc changes)
- Alternative approaches considered (if any)
- Additional context reviewers need

Test plan sections, checkbox lists, and boilerplate are not allowed. The tests in the diff serve as the test plan. Blank descriptions, template-only descriptions, and AI-generated filler are not acceptable. PR descriptions **MUST NOT** include any customer data or sensitive information.

#### Enforcement

- PR template
- CI bot check: non-empty, issue reference present, override via `trivial` label

#### Suggested skill(s)

- [`sentry-skills:create-pr`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills#available-skills)

#### Per-SDK override

<StatusBadge type="no" /> Template wording can vary. Linked-issue and non-empty
requirements are universal.

---

## PR draft mode

#### Rule

PRs **MUST** be created as drafts. Mark ready when CI passes and description is complete.

#### Enforcement

- Convention
- AGENTS.md

#### Suggested skill(s)

- [`sentry-skills:create-pr`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills#available-skills)

#### Per-SDK override

<StatusBadge type="no" />

---

## Changelog entry

#### Rule

User-facing changes (`feat`, `fix`, `perf`, breaking) **REQUIRE** a changelog entry. Internal changes exempt. Override with `skip-changelog` label.

#### Enforcement

- CI check

#### Per-SDK override

<StatusBadge type="yes" /> Format and location vary. Requirement is universal.

---

## Keep PRs focused

#### Rule

A PR **SHOULD** do one thing — and do it well. Avoid mixing functional changes with unrelated refactors, cleanup, or reorganizations. If the work falls into distinct categories, split it into multiple PRs. Smaller, focused PRs are easier to review, reason about, and revert.

#### Enforcement

- Human review + AGENTS.md
- CI advisory for size

#### Suggested skill(s)

- [`sentry-skills:code-review`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills#available-skills)

#### Per-SDK override

<StatusBadge type="yes" /> Size thresholds are SDK-specific.

---

## AI attribution

#### Rule

AI-generated changes get `Co-Authored-By` in commit footer (e.g., `Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`). This is the only AI involvement indicator. "Generated by AI" or similar markers **MUST NOT** appear anywhere.

#### Enforcement

- AGENTS.md instruction

#### Suggested skill(s)

- [`sentry-skills:commit`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills#available-skills) - adds attribution automatically.
- [`sentry-skills:agents-md`](https://github.com/getsentry/skills#available-skills) - ensures AGENTS.md includes the convention.

#### Per-SDK override

<StatusBadge type="no" />
