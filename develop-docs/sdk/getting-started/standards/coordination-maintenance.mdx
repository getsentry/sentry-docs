<SpecSection id="version-support-policy" status="candidate" since="1.0.0">

## Platform/language version support policy

#### Rule

- Supported versions documented in README and docs
- Dropping support is a breaking change ([Breaking change process](/sdk/getting-started/standards/api-architecture#breaking-change-process)) following the deprecation lifecycle ([Deprecation lifecycle](/sdk/getting-started/standards/api-architecture#deprecation-lifecycle))
- Requires evidence: usage data, upstream EOL, maintenance burden
- Announced at least one minor release before the major that drops

#### Enforcement

- CI matrix tests supported versions
- Human process for changes

#### Per-SDK override

<StatusBadge type="yes" /> Each SDK owns its matrix. Process for changing it is
universal.

- Communication template
- Annual drill **RECOMMENDED**

#### Enforcement
