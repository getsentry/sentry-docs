## Cross-SDK coordination protocol

#### Rule

Multi-SDK changes follow: proposal (RFC/issue) → cross-SDK review (1 week minimum) → sequencing decision → tracking board → coordinated communication.

#### Enforcement

Human process. Template for proposals.

#### Suggested skill(s)

—

#### Per-SDK override

Timing varies. Process is universal.

---

## Triaging SLA

#### Rule

All user-reported issues receive substantive first response within 2 business days. Substantive = acknowledges problem, asks for repro, confirms known issue, or explains resolution.

#### Enforcement

Automated labeling. Dashboard tracking.

#### Suggested skill(s)

—

#### Per-SDK override

Stricter SLAs allowed. Baseline is universal.

---

## Platform/language version support policy

#### Rule

Supported versions documented in README and docs. Dropping support is a breaking change ([Breaking change process](api-architecture#breaking-change-process)) following deprecation lifecycle ([Deprecation lifecycle](api-architecture#deprecation-lifecycle)). Requires evidence: usage data, upstream EOL, maintenance burden. Announced at least one minor release before the major that drops.

#### Enforcement

CI matrix tests supported versions. Human process for changes.

#### Suggested skill(s)

—

#### Per-SDK override

Entirely — each SDK owns its matrix. Process for changing it is universal.

---

## Post-release monitoring

#### Rule

After each release: monitor SDK crash detection, verify dogfooding picks up new version, watch issue tracker for 48h. Critical regression → patch within 48h.

#### Enforcement

Automated alerting. Human monitoring.

#### Suggested skill(s)

—

#### Per-SDK override

Tooling varies. Commitment and SLA are universal.

---

## Rollback procedures

#### Rule

Every SDK has documented rollback: how to yank/unpublish, how to cut revert release, who has permissions (plus backup), communication template. At least two people can publish/yank per SDK. Annual drill recommended.

#### Enforcement

Documentation exists. Permissions verified.

#### Suggested skill(s)

—

#### Per-SDK override

Entirely — per-registry mechanics. Requirement to have a plan is universal.
