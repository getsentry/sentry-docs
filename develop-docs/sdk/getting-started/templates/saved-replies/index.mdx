Saved replies are a team tool that lets us respond quickly, consistently, and professionally, without spending mental energy rewriting the same message again and again. By standardizing our responses to common situations, we free up focus for meaningful feedback and ensure consistent expectations and reduce friction for both contributors and reviewers.

Using these replies is encouraged - they give everyone permission to politely uphold our standards, set expectations, and enforce process, even in difficult or high-traffic moments.

To set up saved replies go to [GitHub > Settings > Saved replies](https://github.com/settings/replies), and add all of the replies below.
