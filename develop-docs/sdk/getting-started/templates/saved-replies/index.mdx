description: GitHub saved replies for common scenarios. These are team-approved responses - using them is expected and encouraged.

Saved replies are a team tool that lets us respond quickly, consistently, and professionally, without spending mental energy rewriting the same message again and again. By standardizing our responses to common situations, we free up focus for meaningful feedback and ensure consistent expectations and reduce friction for both contributors and reviewers.

Using these replies is encouraged - they give everyone permission to politely uphold our standards, set expectations, and enforce process, even in difficult or high-traffic moments.

To set up saved replies go to [GitHub > Settings > Saved replies](https://github.com/settings/replies), and add all of the replies below.

Thanks for reporting. We've seen your request and added it to our triage queue.

We'll review it shortly and follow up if we need more information or once next steps are clearer.

</CopyableCard>

<CopyableCard title="Issue/Acknowledge: Reproduction info needed">

Thanks for raising this. We're reviewing it as part of triage.

To move forward, could you share:
- SDK version
- Runtime / framework version
- A minimal reproduction (if available)?

</CopyableCard>

### Requesting Information

<CopyableCard title="Issue/Request: More information needed">

Thanks for reporting this! To help us investigate, could you provide a few more details?

- **SDK version**: (e.g. 1.2.3)
- **Platform/OS version**: (e.g. iOS 17, Android 14, Node 20)
- **Steps to reproduce**: What were you doing when this occurred?
- **Expected behavior**: What did you expect to happen?
- **Actual behavior**: What happened instead?
- **Logs or stack traces**: If available

This will help us narrow things down. Thank you!

</CopyableCard>

<CopyableCard title="Issue/Request: Minimal reproduction needed">

Thanks for reporting this! We'd love to look into it further, but we need a minimal reproduction to investigate effectively. Could you provide a small, self-contained project or code snippet that demonstrates the issue?

A good minimal reproduction:
- Uses the latest SDK version
- Contains only the code necessary to trigger the issue
- Includes steps to run and observe the behavior

This helps us rule out project-specific factors and get to the root cause faster. Thank you!
