title: "Python Dependencies"
---

Unlike our frontend JavaScript story, where we're generally very happy pulling in dependencies, we're much more conservative on
the backend. Any dependency we pull in might require us to eventually (temporarily) fork and vendor it if the upstream
project no longer supports our version of Python.

Additionally, all these dependencies run on the server, making them riskier as they have direct access to customer
data if they turn out to be malicious.

## Adding or updating a dependency

Any new dependency needs to be thoroughly reviewed and approved by [owners-python-build](https://github.com/orgs/getsentry/teams/owners-python-build/members). This group is already automatically tagged in your PR to `sentry` or `getsentry` as soon as you edit relevant files. For other repos you might need to do it manually.

To add or update a dependency:

1. Clone https://github.com/getsentry/pypi/.
2. `cd` into your clone and run `python3 -m add_pkg PKGNAME` (or `python3 -m add_pkg PKGNAME==PKGVERSION` if you want a version other than the latest).
3. Commit the resulting changes to a branch, open a PR in `getsentry/pypi`, and tag someone on your team (any engineer can approve PRs on this repo).
4. Once your PR is merged, go back to the main repo whose dependencies you want to change (`sentry`, `getsentry`, etc.).
5. In that repo, add to or update `requirements-base.txt` or `requirements-dev.txt`, as appropriate. Note that many of our dependencies are pinned with lower bounds only, to encourage updating to latest versions, though we do use exact pins for certain core dependencies like `django`. Choose whichever one feels most appropriate in your case.
6. Run `make freeze-requirements`. You might need to wait a few minutes for the changes to `getsentry/pypi` to be deployed before this will work without erroring.
7. Commit your changes (which should consist of changes to both one of the `requirements` files and its corresponding lockfile) to a branch and open a PR in the relevant repo. If it's not obvious, explain why you're adding or updating the dependency. Tag `owners-python-build` if they haven't already been auto-tagged.
8. Merge your PR, pull `master`, and run `make install py-dev`.

## Depending on forks

If you need to make modifications to a dependency and need to deploy the result
before it is accepted upstream, you can fork the dependency.

Depending on forks is generally discouraged unless necessary, and you should
make sure that the changes in your fork are **not required for self-hosted to
function,** because they won't be included in the PyPI distribution of Sentry.

1. Fork into the `getsentry` organization.
2. Depend on the fork using `library-name @ https://github.com/getsentry/<repo>/archive/<40 char sha>.zip` in `getsentry`'s `requirements-base.txt`.
3. The requirement in `sentry` stays the same, because we upload `sentry` to PyPI, and PyPI does not allow us to depend on URLs.

## Unclear?

If you have questions about dependencies, ask [owners-python-build](https://github.com/orgs/getsentry/teams/owners-python-build/members) or in #discuss-dev-infra.
