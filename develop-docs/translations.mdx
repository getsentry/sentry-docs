We use [**Transifex**](https://www.transifex.com/getsentry/sentry) to translate Sentry.

Other things that mean translating: localization, internationalization, i18n, l10n

If you need access to manage translations, translators, languages, or anything else, please talk to one of the following people:

## Approving Translators and Languages

General rules to follow when doing approvals.

1. Don't approve new languages generally.
2. Don't approve new languages that are duplicates of existing languages.
3. Don't approve new team members unless they seem reliable (see security note below).

## Backfilling a Language

We have the ability to pay translators to come in and backfill a language. This has been done a number of times over the years, and is a good way to get an acceptable amount of coverage. There are caveats however:

- They often need "context" for a string, which we're usually missing in our code (or in the database). This means someone has to respond to their requests.
- The quality will be average - you given them a style to aim for, and they often do an ok-enough job.
- It's not free, though its cheap so it's not a big deal.

## Translation Security

It's possible for translators to inject advertisements (links) or other bad content into translations. For this reason we don't accept translations implicitly - you get approved first - but it means we also need to do at least a minor bit of research on the translator themselves. Generally this is left to your own judgement, but take a look at their profile and ask yourself if they seem like a real human, or if this is a one-off account intended to use for abuse.

## Updating Translations (source code)

Translations have to be updated manually in Sentry. Historically this happens before we tag a new release, but should be frequent (e.g. weekly).

To update translations, open a terminal within the Sentry repo and run the following:

```bash
make update-transifex
```
