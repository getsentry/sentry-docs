## Internal vs External Relay?

Relay fetches project configs from an "upstream". That upstream can either be Sentry or another Relay, both have their own implementation of the same endpoint.

Your configuration will flow from Sentry to either:

- Internal Relay (freight deployment = `relay`)

- External Relays (customers run those, we practically have no deprecation policy for old versions)

Internal Relay can forward your configuration to:

- PoP Relays (freight deployment = `relay-pop`)

Generally, all of those must be able to deal with the changes you make to the project config schema.

## Naming conventions

All fields should be emitted in camelCase. When defining new types in Relay, make sure to add `#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]` at the top of it:

```rust
#[derive(Deserialize, Serialize)]
#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]
struct Foo {
    ops_breakdown: ...
}
```

## Adding new fields in projectconfig endpoint(s)

The endpoint is implemented by both Sentry and Relay itself. When Sentry receives a project config request, it differentiates between trusted Relays operated by Sentry and untrusted Relays operated by customers. Untrusted Relays receive only a subset of the fields: 

- In Sentry, this is handled by an [early return](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/blob/b1434710fff9d8f90c99668bcc958ed1ee52b66e/src/sentry/relay/config.py#L165-L167) to stop populating the config object.
- In Relay, this is implemented by having two separate types for trusted vs restricted project config, either `ProjectConfig` (consumed by trusted Relays) or `LimitedProjectConfig` (consumed by untrusted Relays).

For as long as your new feature is in development, it's recommended to emit new/different fields only for trusted Relays. 

## Defining New Structs in Relay

- use `#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]`, even if all fields are single words.
- never specify `deny_unknown_fields`

New structs are allowed to contain mandatory fields without a default.

## Defining New Enums

There are two kinds of enums:

- Plain string enumerations. The string value determines the variant of the enumeration.
- Internally tagged enumerations. These are structures (JSON objects) with a discriminator column that indicates the variant.
- Untagged enumerations. When the type of the field can differ, this allows to serialize the first matching variant. This is used, for example, if a field can either be a string or a number.

Unlike structs, unknown variants are not implicitly ignored by Relay. When defining an enumeration, *always* add a variant to catch unknown variants using `#[serde(other)]`. For example:

```rust
#[derive(Deserialize, Serialize)]
#[serde(tag = "type", rename_all = "camelCase")]
enum BreakdownConfig {
    SpanOperations { ... },
    #[serde(other)]
    Unsupported,
}
```

Before adding a new variant in Sentry, verify that Relay implements this correctly. If this is not the case, proceed by replacing the field just like when changing a fields type. Never add variants to an enum that does not have an unknown variant.

It is acceptable that Relay does not forward unknown enum variants by dropping the original value, as it is done with the above approach.

## Adding Top-Level Fields

In case you're developing a new feature, you likely want to add completely new data to the project config and not touch existing structs. Here's a small checklist that applies in addition to everything else:

- Verify that the field is in `camelCase`.
- Ensure the field name has not been used in a past version of Relay. `git log -G field_name` is a simple way to search git history for strings that occur in diffs.
- Make sure your field is either optional or has a default
- Do not serialize when the field is `None` or default via `serde(skip_serializing_if)`.
- Use `ErrorBoundary` around the field type for as long as your new feature is pre-GA and can change its definition. This makes sure that if the field definition is malformed, Relay contains the error and continues to parse the rest of the project config.
- Do not use types with platform specific behavior, such as `usize`.

  It can be tempting to use `usize` if for some reason the max value of your field is platform-dependent (i.e. whether the Relay that deserializes currently runs on a 32-bit OS). This *can be* the case if your field is an index into some array/vec. Even in those cases it is barely worth it. Keep in mind that not only the current Relay needs to use that number as array index, but also downstream Relays.

## Adding Subfields

In principle, it's permitted to add new fields at any time. Relay ignores additional fields, so struct field definitions can be implemented and deployed at a later point. For example, a struct like this will deserialize just fine from a JSON message with additional fields:

```rust
struct Foo {
    foo: u64,
}

// compatible with: {"foo": 123}, {"foo": 123, "bar": 456}, {"foo": 123, ...}
// incompatible with: {"foo": "123"}
```

There are two caveats:

- As demonstrated above, changing types is *not* safe. See below for instructions on changing types.
- Ensure the field name has never been used before. It could have been implemented with different types, or trigger unwanted behavior in prior versions of Relay.
- Note that adding enum variants requires a different approach.

## Renaming Fields

Do not rename a field for features that are generally available for external Relays. Renaming a field makes the field invisible to older Relays. This makes it infeasible to rename fields for aesthetic reasons (it *may* be fine if your feature is pre-EA), but for the same reason [it is a useful mechanism for versioning](#breaking-changes-and-actual-versioning)

## Changing Field Types

Assuming your field is emitted for external Relays, **changing a field type is
rarely possible**. Even for internal Relays, changing types of fields is only
possible if the two types have identical serialization/deserialization
behavior. This is rather unlikely and so hard to determine that we require you
always [rename the field](#breaking-changes-and-actual-versioning) in addition.

## Deployment & Monitoring

Talk to the ingest team for deploying and monitoring.

## Breaking changes, and actual versioning

We've mostly gone through things that we don't want you to do, as they will cause incidents.

In case you do need to make larger changes to the schema, or you want to do a large amount of smaller changes and feel like guaranteeing backwards compat for all of them is too hard, consider renaming the top-level field `x` to `x_v2`.

This will effectively hide the field from older Relays, so field `x` has to be an optional field in the first place.

For certain protocol changes there is a ["project state
version"](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/blob/3933cd6ccd59c3270f56853ffbc8678b219e44e6/relay-server/src/actors/project_upstream.rs#L25-L34)
in Relay that could be bumped. It was used once to implement a larger change to
the protocol.
