title: "Feature Flags"
---

Feature flags are controlled in Sentry at the commit and configuration level. At this time there is built-in way to modify them in production in real-time.

You can find a list of features available by looking at `sentry/features/__init__.py`. They're declared on the `FeatureManager` like so:

```python
default_manager.add("organizations:onboarding", OrganizationFeature)  # NOQA
```

The feature can be enabled with the following in your `config.py`:

```python
SENTRY_FEATURES["organizations:onboarding"] = True
```

Additionally a helper is provided within the Python test suite give feature variants:

```python
# test with the feature on
with self.feature("organizations:onboarding"):
    # ...

# test with the feature off
with self.feature({"organizations:onboarding": False}):
    # ...
```
