title: "Assigned ports"
---

The following is a non-exhaustive list of ports used by Sentry services or any dependency of a Sentry service in development setups. It serves two purposes:

* Finding out why a port is used on your work machine and which process to kill to make it free.
* Finding out which ports are probably safe to assign to new services.

| Port | Service                                    | Description
|:-----|:-------------------------------------------|:-----------
| 9000 | Clickhouse                                 | <Link to="/services/devservices/">Devservice</Link> `clickhouse`. Database for Snuba.
| 8123 | Clickhouse                                 |
| 9009 | Clickhouse                                 | 
| 3021 | Symbolicator                               | <Link to="/services/devservices/">Devservice</Link> `symbolicator`. For processing stacktraces.
| 1218 | [Snuba][]                                  | <Link to="/services/devservices/">Devservice</Link> `snuba`. For searching events.
| 1219 | [Snuba][] admin                            | Not part of devservices setup, but running `snuba admin` will listen on this port.
| 9092 | Kafka                                      | <Link to="/services/devservices/">Devservice</Link> `kafka`. for relay-sentry communication and optionally for sentry-snuba communication
| 6379 | Redis                                      | <Link to="/services/devservices/">Devservice</Link> `redis` (or perhaps installed via Homebrew in rustier setups), responsible for caches, relay projectconfigs and Celery queues
| 5432 | Postgres                                   | <Link to="/services/devservices/">Devservice</Link> `postgres` (or perhaps installed via Homebrew in rustier setups)
| 7899 | [Relay][]                                  | <Link to="/services/devservices/">Devservice</Link> `relay`. Serves APIs for SDKs to send events to (aka event ingestion). Webpack on 8000 reverse-proxies to this server. Starts/stops with `sentry devserver`.
| 8000 | <Link to="/environment/">Sentry Dev</Link> | Webpack devserver, routing all ingest paths to Relay, and the rest to uWSGI. Routing is defined in `webpack.config.ts` in Sentry.
| 8001 | uWSGI                                      | Starts/stops with `sentry devserver`. Serves the Django app/API. Webpack on 8000 reverse-proxies to this server.
| 7999 | Sentry frontend prod proxy                 | For testing local UI changes against a prod API
| 8000 | [Develop docs][]                           | The website around this document. **Conflicts with Sentry Dev.**
| 3000 | [User docs][]                              | User-facing documentation. May conflict with Relay if Relay is run outside of devservices.
| 9001 | Sentry Dev Styleguide server               | Bound when running `sentry devserver --styleguide`
| 9000 | `sentry run web`                           | Legacy default port for `sentry run web`, changed to 9001 to avoid conflict with Clickhouse.
| 9001 | `sentry run web`                           | Barebones frontend without webpack or Relay. <Link to="/environment/">Sentry Dev</Link> is likely better. **Conflicts with Sentry Dev Styleguide server.**
| 8000 | [Relay][] mkdocs documentation             | At some point this is going to get merged into our existing docs repos. **Conflicts with Sentry Dev.**

## Finding out what's running on your machine

* Use `lsof -nP -i4 | grep LISTEN` to find occupied ports on macOS.
* The Dashboard UI of Docker for Mac shows you running docker containers/devservices together with assigned ports and option to start/stop.
