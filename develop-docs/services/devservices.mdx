title: "Service Manager (devservices)"
---

Sentry provides an abstraction to Docker to run required services within development called `devserver`.

```shell
Usage: sentry devservices [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Manage dependent development services required for Sentry.

  Do not use in production!

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  attach  Run a single devservice in foreground, as...
  down    Shut down all services.
  rm      Delete all services and associated data.
  up      Run/update dependent services.
```

## Viewing logs for a service

```shell
# Follow snuba logs
docker logs -f sentry_snuba
```

## Running CLI clients for redis, postgres and clickhouse

```shell
# redis
docker exec -it sentry_redis redis-cli

# clickhouse
docker exec -it sentry_clickhouse clickhouse-client

# psql
docker exec -it sentry_postgres psql -U postgres
```

## Removing container state

Should you really bamboozle your containers or volumes, you can use docker to remove them. As
an example lets say we've managed to corrupt our postgres database while working on a migration,
and we want to start over:

```shell
# First ensure you containers are off
sentry devservices down

# Find the postgres container. Note the container id in the first column
docker ps -a | grep postgres

# Remove the postgres container
docker rm <container-id>

# Remove all unreferenced volumes
docker volume prune
```
