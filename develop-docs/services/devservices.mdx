title: "Service Manager (devservices)"
---

Sentry provides an abstraction to Docker to run required services within development called `devservices`.

```shell
Usage: sentry devservices [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Manage dependent development services required for Sentry.

  Do not use in production!

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  attach  Run a single devservice in foreground, as...
  down    Shut down all services.
  rm      Delete all services and associated data.
  up      Run/update dependent services.
```

## Viewing logs for a service

```shell
# Follow snuba logs
docker logs -f sentry_snuba
```

## Running CLI clients for redis, postgres and clickhouse

```shell
# redis
docker exec -it sentry_redis redis-cli

# clickhouse
docker exec -it sentry_clickhouse clickhouse-client

# psql
docker exec -it sentry_postgres psql -U postgres
```

## Removing container state

Should you really bamboozle your containers or volumes, you can use `devservices rm` to start over.

```shell
# Remove all data (containers, volumes, and networks) associated with ALL services
sentry devservices rm
```

As an example, let's say we've managed to corrupt our postgres
database while working on a migration, and you want to reset
your postgres data you can do:

```shell
# Remove all data (containers, volumes, and networks) associated with a single service
sentry devservices rm postgres
```
