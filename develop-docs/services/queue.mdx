title: "Asynchronous Workers"
---

Sentry comes with a built-in queue to process tasks in a more asynchronous fashion. For example when an event comes in instead of writing it to the database immediately, it sends a job to the queue so that the request can be returned right away, and the background workers handle actually saving that data.

Sentry relies on the [Celery](https://docs.celeryproject.org/) library for managing workers.

## Registering a Task

Sentry configures tasks with a special decorator that allows us more explicit control over the callable.

```python
from sentry.tasks.base import instrumented_task

@instrumented_task(
    name="sentry.tasks.do_work",
    queue="important_queue",
    default_retry_delay=60 * 5,
    max_retries=None,
)
def do_work(kind_of_work, **kwargs):
    # ...
```

There are a few important points:

- The task name _must_ be declared.

  The task name is how Celery identifies messages (requests) and which
  function and worker needs to handle those messages.  If the tasks
  are not named celery will derive a name from the module and function
  names which makes the name tied to the location of the code and more
  brittle for future code maintenance.

- Tasks _must_ accept `\*\*kwargs`` to handle rolling compatibility.

  This ensures tasks will accept any message which happens to be in
  the queue rather than fail for unknown arguments.  It helps with
  rolling changes back and forwards, deploys are not instant and
  messages may be produced with multiple versions of arguments.

  While this allows rolling forwards and backwards without complete
  task failures, care must still be taken for workers to handle
  messages with both old and new arguments when changing the
  arguments.  This does reduce the number of required changes in such
  a migration a little and gives some more operator flexibility, but
  message loss because of unknown arguments is still not acceptable.

  When adding an argument to an existing task, make a PR adding the 
  new parameter with a safe default and wait for it to deploy before 
  merging a PR that starts to use the value. The new argument should 
  be optional to allow for rollbacks.

- Tasks _should_ automatically retry on failure.

- Tasks arguments _should_ be primitive types and small.

  Task arguments are serialised into the message sent across the
  brokers and the workers need to deserialise them again.  Doing this
  with complex types is brittle and should be avoided.  E.g. prefer to
  pass an ID to the task which can be used to load the data from cache
  rather than the data itself.

  Similarly, to keep the message brokers and workers running
  efficiently serialising large values into the message results in
  large messages, large queues and more (de)serialising overheads so
  should be avoided.

- The tasks' module _must_ be added to `CELERY_IMPORTS`.

  Celery workers must find the task by name, they can only do so if
  the worker has imported the module with the decorated task function
  because this is what registers the task by name.  Thus every module
  containing a task must be added to the `CELERY_IMPORTS` setting in
  `src/sentry/conf/server.py`.

## Running a Worker

Workers can be run by using the [Sentry CLI](https://docs.sentry.io/product/cli/).

```bash
$ sentry run worker
```

## Starting the Cron Process

Sentry schedules routine jobs via a cron process:

```bash
SENTRY_CONF=/etc/sentry sentry run cron
```

## Configuring the Broker

Sentry supports two primary brokers which may be adjusted depending on your workload: RabbitMQ and Redis.

### Redis

The default broker is Redis, and will work under most situations. The primary limitation to using Redis is that all pending work must fit in memory.

```python
BROKER_URL = "redis://localhost:6379/0"
```

If your Redis connection requires a password for authentication, you need to use the following format:

```python
BROKER_URL = "redis://:password@localhost:6379/0"
```

### RabbitMQ

If you run with a high workload, or have concerns about fitting the pending workload in memory, then RabbitMQ is an ideal candidate for backing Sentry’s workers.

```python
BROKER_URL = "amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/sentry"
```
