Sentry provides support for both outbound, and incoming email.

Inbound email is fairly limited in use, and currently it only supports processing replies to error and note notifications.

## Outbound Email

You'll need to configure an SMTP provider for outbound email.

TODO: Document mail preview backend.

<dl>
<dt><code>mail.backend</code></dt>
<dd><markdown>
Declared in `config.yml`.

The backend to be used for email delivery. Options are `smtp`, `console`, and `dummy`.

Defaults to `smtp`. Use `dummy` if you’d like to disable email delivery.

</markdown></dd>

<dt><code>mail.from</code></dt>
<dd><markdown>
Declared in `config.yml`.

The email address used for outbound email in the `From` header.

Defaults to `root@localhost`. It’s highly recommended to change this value to ensure reliable email delivery.

</markdown></dd>

<dt><code>mail.host</code></dt>
<dd><markdown>
Declared in `config.yml`.

The hostname to connect to for SMTP connections.

Defaults to `localhost`.

</markdown></dd>

<dt><code>mail.port</code></dt>
<dd><markdown>
Declared in `config.yml`.

The port to connect to for SMTP connections.

Defaults to `25`.

</markdown></dd>

<dt><code>mail.username</code></dt>
<dd><markdown>
Declared in `config.yml`.

The username to use when authenticating with the SMTP server.

Defaults to `(empty)`.

</markdown></dd>

<dt><code>mail.password</code></dt>
<dd><markdown>
Declared in `config.yml`.

The password to use when authenticating with the SMTP server.

Defaults to `(empty)`.

</markdown></dd>

<dt><code>mail.use-tls</code></dt>
<dd><markdown>
Declared in `config.yml`.

Should Sentry use TLS when connecting to the SMTP server?

Defaults to `false`.

</markdown></dd>

<dt><code>mail.list-namespace</code></dt>
<dd><markdown>
Declared in `config.yml`.

The mailing list namespace for emails sent by this Sentry server. This should be a domain you own (often the same domain as the domain part of the `mail.from` configuration parameter value) or `localhost`.

</markdown></dd>

## Inbound Email

For configuration you can pick from different backends.

### Mailgun

Start by choosing a domain to handle inbound email. We find it easiest if you maintain a separate domain from anything else. In our example, we’re going to choose `inbound.sentry.example.com`. You’ll need to configure your DNS records for the given domain according to the Mailgun documentation.

Create a new route in mailgun:

```
Priority:
  0
Filter Expression:
  catch_all()
Actions:
  forward("https://sentry.example.com/api/hooks/mailgun/inbound/")
Description:
  Sentry inbound handler
```

Configure Sentry with the appropriate settings:

```yaml
# Your Mailgun API key (used to verify incoming webhooks)
mail.mailgun-api-key: ""

# Set the SMTP hostname to your configured inbound domain
mail.reply-hostname: "inbound.sentry.example.com"

# Inform Sentry to send the appropriate mail headers to enable
# incoming replies
mail.enable-replies: true
```

That’s it! You’ll now be able to respond to activity notifications on errors via your email client.

And finally, update Sentry with the appropriate settings:

```yaml
# Set the SMTP hostname to your configured inbound domain
mail.reply-hostname: "inbound.sentry.example.com"

# Inform Sentry to send the appropriate mail headers to enable
# incoming replies
mail.enable-replies: true
```

That’s it! You’ll now be able to respond to activity notifications on errors via your email client.
