title: 'Feature Flags'
---

Feature flags are declared in Sentry's codebase (look for `SENTRY_FEATURES` in
[`server.py`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/blob/master/src/sentry/conf/server.py)).
For self-hosted users, those flags are then configured via `sentry.conf.py`.
For Sentry's SaaS deployment, options automator is used to configure flags in production.

You can find a list of features available by looking at two files:

 - `sentry/features/permanent.py` - Features typically managed by subscriptions for sentry.io
 - `sentry/features/temporary.py` - Features used during development intended to be removed

They're declared on the `FeatureManager` like so:

```python
# pass FeatureHandlerStrategy.OPTIONS to use options automator:
manager.add("organizations:onboarding", OrganizationFeature, FeatureHandlerStrategy.OPTIONS)
# pass FeatureHandlerStrategy.INTERNAL if you don't plan to use options automator:
manager.add("organizations:onboarding", OrganizationFeature, FeatureHandlerStrategy.INTERNAL)
```

The feature can be enabled with the following in your `sentry.conf.py`, usually located at `~/.sentry/`:

```python
SENTRY_FEATURES["organizations:onboarding"] = True
```

You can modify the state of [feature flags in tests](/testing/#setting-options-and-feature-flags) using a context manager.

Generally you want your feature names to be unique to help in their
[removal](#after-launch-graduation).  For example a feature flag like `trends`
may prove difficult to find because `trends` may appear throughout the codebase.
But a name like `performance-trends-view` is more likely to be unique and easier
to remove later

## Creating a new Feature Flag

### Determine what scope the feature should have

Features can be scoped by organization, and projects. If you're not confident
you want a project feature, create an organization level one. In this example
we'll build a feature called `test-feature` scoped at the _organization_ level.

### Determine the permanency of your feature

Typically we use feature flags for development. They are usually [intended to
be graduated](#after-launch-graduation). Feature flag that controls a
subscription-based feature for sentry.io are permanent.

Most feature flags are placed in `temporary.py`, permanent flags live in
`permanent.py`.

### Add your feature to server.py

[`conf/server.py`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/blob/master/src/sentry/conf/server.py)
contains many of the default settings in the application. Here you will add
your feature, and decide what default value it should hold unless specified by
the user.

The `SENTRY_FEATURES` dictionary contains all the features in the application
with their corresponding scope. Your feature should start off disabled by default:

```python
SENTRY_FEATURES = {
    'organizations:test-feature': False,
    'auth:register': True,
    # ...
    'projects:minidump': False,
}
```

### Add your feature to the FeatureManager

If you want to back your feature [flag via options](#building-your-options-based-feature)
add the feature to the `FeatureManager` like so using the `OPTIONS` enum.:

```python
default_manager.add('organizations:test-feature', OrganizationFeature, FeatureHandlerStrategy.OPTIONS)
```

If you don't plan to use options, use `FeatureHandlerStrategy.INTERNAL`, for example:

```python
default_manager.add('organizations:test-feature', OrganizationFeature, FeatureHandlerStrategy.INTERNAL)
```

### Add it to the Organization Model Serializer

The Organization model serializer
(`src/sentry/api/serializers/models/organization.py`) builds a list
called `feature_list` that is given to the front-end to use. By default the all
features are checked and those that are present are added into the list. If
your feature requires additional custom logic you will have to update the
organization serializer

### Using Model Flags (Less common)

Sometimes a flag on the model is used to indicate a feature flag as shown
below. This is not recommended unless there is a specific reason to make
changes to the model. For example, the `require_2fa` flag affects behavior on
the backend to enforce two-factor authentication.

```python
feature_list = []

if getattr(obj.flags, 'allow_joinleave'):
    feature_list.append('open-membership')
if not getattr(obj.flags, 'disable_shared_issues'):
    feature_list.append('shared-issues')
if getattr(obj.flags, 'require_2fa'):
    feature_list.append('require-2fa')
```

## Checking your feature

### In Python code

The FeatureManager's `has` method checks see if the feature exists. The has
method takes in the feature's name, the object that corresponds to the scope of
the feature *(i.e. an organization for an organization level feature or
a project for a project level feature)*, and the actor (aka user). In our case
the feature will be added like:

```python
if features.has('organizations:test-feature', obj, actor=user):
    feature_list.append('test-feature')
```

which only adds the feature to the `feature_list` if that feature is enabled for
the organization and the type of user given. Note that when we give the feature
to the frontend, we remove the scope prefix, and
our `'organizations:test-feature'` becomes `'test-feature'`.

### In JavaScript

There is a difference between using the flag in Sentry and in GetSentry. At this
stage you're not quite ready to use your feature flag in GetSentry, but you are
able to use it inside Sentry.

### Declarative features with the Feature component

React uses a declarative programming paradigm. As such, we have a utility
component that we use to hide components based on the feature flags available to
a organization/project

```jsx
import Feature from 'sentry/components/acl/feature';

const toRender = (
  <Feature features={['test-feature']}>
    <MyComponentToFlag />
  </Feature>
);
```

### Imperative feature flag checks

There are some exceptions when React components are generated imperatively (e.g.
headers/columns for Tables). In difficult times like these, the `Organization`
/ `Project` object has a array of the feature flags, which you can use in this
way:

```jsx
const {organization} = this.props;

// Method 2
organization.features.includes('test-feature'); // evals to True/False
```

## Enabling features in development

In Sentry you can run `sentry devserver` to view your changes in development
mode. If you would like to view a change behind a feature flag, you will need to
open the file `~/.sentry/sentry.conf.py` on your local machine. This file
contains your local settings for the sentry application, and can be viewed and
edited. If you would like to toggle a flag on or off, add this to your
configuration file:

```python
SENTRY_FEATURES['organizations:test-feature'] = True
```

Where `SENTRY_FEATURES` will correspond to the `SENTRY_FEATURES` from `step 2`.
Set it to `True` if you'd like the feature to be available and `False` if not.

## Enabling your feature in production

Feature flags are declared in Sentry's codebase. For self-hosted users, those
flags are then configured via `sentry.conf.py`. For Sentry's SaaS deployment,
you have the choice of using an option backed rollout via Options Automator,
or by writing a custom feature flag handler.

- [Options based features](#building-your-options-based-feature) allow a feature
to be rolled out to a specific subset of LA orgs, a percentage of EA orgs,
and/or a percentage of all orgs. These can be used in high scale situations, and are generally
preferred over customer feature handlers.

## Building your options based feature
Declare your feature in sentry/features/temporary.py or 
sentry/features/permanent.py like so: 
```python
manager.add("organizations:your-new-flag", OrganizationFeature, FeatureHandlerStrategy.OPTIONS)
```

This automatically registers a feature handler for you in getsentry, and also
auto registers the relevant options.

To roll out your feature, you'll want to set the rollout options via options 
automator. To figure out the options you need to configure, you can run the 
following script in getsentry:
```python
./bin/generate_automator_feature_options.py --flag organizations:your-new-flag
```

It will then produce output like 

```python
Generating automator options for feature flag `organizations:your-new-flag`
Add these to the appropriate file in options automator to roll out your feature
For example, to roll out in the US, you can add them to https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-options-automator/blob/main/options/regions/us/app.yaml
To roll out to all production regions, you can add them to https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-options-automator/blob/main/options/default/app.yaml
Options:
  organizations.your-new-flag.la-rollout: 0.0
  organizations.your-new-flag.ea-rollout: 0.0
  organizations.your-new-flag.ga-rollout: 0.0
  organizations.your-new-flag.la-orgs: [
    "codecov",
    "sentry",
    "sentry-sdks",
    "sentry-test",
    "sentry-st",
    "sentry-emerging-tech",
    "specto-dev",
  ]
```

Open a pr in https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-options-automator to set 
these options and you can roll out your feature flag. You can also customize
which orgs will be in your la rollout by modifying `la-orgs`

## After launch (Graduation)

After your feature has been mainlined and is available for all customers on
sentry.io, you have a few potential paths:

- If the feature cannot be disabled, or you don't need to conditionally disable
  the feature, remove the feature flag and all related checks from the Sentry
  code base. If necessary, also remove references to the feature from the
  [self-hosted](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted) and getsentry
  repositories.
- If the feature will only be available to SaaS customers on specific plans, you
  need to add your feature flag to the appropriate plans and update feature
  handlers (see below).You should also enable the feature by default in
  [`conf/server.py`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/blob/master/src/sentry/conf/server.py)
  in sentry to ensure that the feature is available for self-hosted deployments.

## Getsentry feature handlers

Getsentry contains a variety of feature handlers that override the
`SENTRY_FEATURES` map.

### Plan specific features

If your feature is available for a subset of plans (eg. only on Business plans)
you need to:

1. Disable the feature in `getsentry/conf/settings/defaults.py` by updating `SENTRY_FEATURES`.
2. Add your feature to the appropriate plan feature list.
3. Update `SubscriptionPlanFeatureHandler` to handle your feature.

### Custom handlers

If your feature requires additional logic to become active, you can also
implement a feature handler in getsentry. For example, you can create a feature flag that is backed by [options](/options/). follow these steps:

1. Disable the feature in `getsentry/conf/settings/defaults.py` by updating `SENTRY_FEATURES`.
2. Add a new feature handler class in `getsentry/features.py` that determines availability of the feature based on the organization or actor.
3. Register the handler at the bottom of `getsentry/features.py`.
