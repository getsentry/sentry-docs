title: "Environment"
---

This guide steps you through configuring a local development environment for the Sentry server on macOS and Linux. If you're using
another operating system (Plan 9, BeOS, Windows, â€¦) the instructions are still roughly the same, but we don't maintain any official documentation
for anything else for now.

## Setup

Begin by installing the `devenv` tool following [these instructions](https://github.com/getsentry/devenv#install).

After installation you should be able to run `devenv bootstrap` which will guide you through the rest.

When you're done with setup, you'll want to also review the <Link to="/workflow/">development workflow</Link>.


## Keeping your environment up-to-date

Simply run `devenv sync` inside of your sentry or getsentry repo.


## Running the Development Server

```shell
sentry devserver --workers
```

If you are developing for aesthetics only and do not rely on the async workers, you can omit the `--workers` flag in order
to use fewer system resources.

Access it at [http://dev.getsentry.net:8000](http://dev.getsentry.net:8000) (you'll have to wait a bit for webpack to finish).
A superuser account should have been created for you during bootstrap - `admin@sentry.io` with password `admin`.
You can create other users with `sentry createuser`.

<Alert title="Note" level="info">

  When asked for the root address of the server, make sure that you use
  [http://dev.getsentry.net:8000](http://dev.getsentry.net:8000), as both
  protocol _and_ port are required in order for DNS and some pages' URLs to be
  displayed correctly.

</Alert>

## Running the Getsentry Development Server

<Alert title="Employees Only" level="warning">
  Only Sentry employees have access to getsentry.
</Alert>

See also: <Link to="/sentry-vs-getsentry/">Sentry vs Getsentry</Link>

```shell
getsentry devserver --workers
```

**Note**: You **cannot** have both sentry and getsentry devserver running at the same time.

After the server warms up for a little while, you must access it
at [http://dev.getsentry.net:8000](http://dev.getsentry.net:8000/).
Using localhost doesn't work.

If you need to overwrite configuration options for your local
environment, you can create `getsentry/conf/settings/devlocal.py` and put the
configuration option overrides there. This module will be automatically imported
by `dev.py` if it exists.


### Frontend Only & Backend Only

Please refer to [Frontend Development Server](/frontend/development-server/) and [Backend Development Server](/backend/development-server/) for alternative ways to bring up the Sentry UI.

### Ingestion Pipeline (Relay)

Some services are not run in all situations. Among those are <Link to="/services/relay/">Relay</Link> and the ingest workers. If you need
a more production-like environment in development, you can set `SENTRY_USE_RELAY=True` in `~/.sentry/sentry.conf.py`. If `sentry devservices` is currently up ,make sure to restart it after you make the change. This will launch Relay
as part of the `devserver` workflow.

Additionally, you can explicitly control this during `devserver` usage with the `--ingest` and `--no-ingest` flags. The `sentry devservices`
command will not update Relay automatically in that case, to do this manually run:

```shell
sentry devservices up --skip-only-if relay
sentry devserver --workers --ingest
```

If you want to enable the entire metrics ingestion pipeline, you need to add the following to your config at `~/.sentry/sentry.conf.py`:

```python
SENTRY_USE_RELAY = True
SENTRY_USE_METRICS_DEV = True
SENTRY_EVENTSTREAM = "sentry.eventstream.kafka.KafkaEventStream"
SENTRY_FEATURES['organizations:metrics-extraction'] = True  # Enables session metrics
SENTRY_FEATURES['organizations:transaction-metrics-extraction'] = True  # Enables transaction metrics
```

After enabling `KafkaEventStream` the `snuba` service has to be reset to pick up the new configuration:

```shell
sentry devservices rm snuba
sentry devservices up snuba
```

**Problem:** `DoesNotExist: Subscription matching query does not exist` during getsentry devserver

**Solution:**

```shell
./bin/mock-subscription
```

You can also set your local instance's org to use a business plan by running the
following in getsentry:

```shell
./bin/mock-subscription <org_slug> --plan mm2_a_500k
```

---

**Problem:** You see an error that mentions something like `pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: The 'some_dependency<0.6.0,>=0.5.5' distribution was not found and is required by sentry`

**Solution:** Your virtualenv needs to be updated. Run `make install-py-dev`.

---

**Problem:** You see `Error occured while trying to proxy to: dev.getsentry.net:8000/`

**Solution:** You likely need to upgrade your Python dependencies. Go to the git root directory and run `make install-py-dev`.

---

**Problem:** `Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'integration-docs-platforms'`

**Solution:**

```shell
make build-platform-assets
```

---

**Problem:** You see `SessionNotCreatedException: Message: session not created: This version of ChromeDriver only supports Chrome version 76`

Or:

```shell
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/joshua.li/dev/sentry/sentry/src/sentry/utils/pytest/selenium.py", line 344, in browser
    driver = start_chrome(**chrome_args)
  File "/Users/joshua.li/dev/sentry/sentry/src/sentry/utils/retries.py", line 41, in execute_with_retry
    return retrier(functools.partial(fn, *args, **kwargs))
  File "/Users/joshua.li/dev/sentry/sentry/src/sentry/utils/retries.py", line 85, in __call__
    error,
RetryException: Could not successfully execute <functools.partial object at 0x10f31e7e0> within 15.830 seconds (12 attempts.)
```

**Solution:**

ChromeDriver needs to be updated.

```shell
brew upgrade --cask chromedriver
```

---

**Problem:**

```shell
--- snip ---
00:51:27 server  | ImportError: cannot import name _remove_dead_weakref
00:51:27 server  | unable to load app 0 (mountpoint='') (callable not found or import error)
```

This is caused by uwsgi running the wrong version of Python. When starting up, you'll see something like

```shell
uwsgi socket 0 bound to TCP address 127.0.0.1:8889 fd 3
Python version: 2.7.10 (default, Feb 22 2019, 21:17:52)  [GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 10.0.1 (clang-1001.0.37.14)]
Set PythonHome to /Users/dfuller/code/sentry/.venv
```

The Python version here should be 2.7.16, but will be a lower version, likely your system Python. This is because uwsgi was
compiled against a stale Python and the resultant wheel has been cached by pip.

**Solution:**

In your sentry virtualenv:

```shell
pip uninstall uwsgi
pip install --no-cache-dir uwsgi
```

---

**Problem:** You see `DoesNotExist: Subscription matching query does not exist`

**Solution:** In getsentry, run the following to mock a subscription:

```shell
./bin/mock-subscription <org_slug>
```

---

**Problem:** You see something like `Error: No such container: sentry_postgres`, or you don't see `sentry_snuba`, `sentry_postgres`, `sentry_clickhouse`, and `sentry_redis` listed under `COMMAND NAMES`.

**Solution:**

```shell
sentry devservices up
```

---

**Problem:** You see something like `Error 61 connecting to 127.0.0.1:6379. Connection refused.` when running your dev server.

**Solution:** Make sure your Docker services are running:

```shell
docker ps
```
