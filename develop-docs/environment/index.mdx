This guide steps you through configuring a local development environment for the Sentry server on macOS and Linux. If you're using
another operating system (Plan 9, BeOS, Windows, â€¦) the instructions are still roughly the same, but we don't maintain any official documentation
for anything else for now.

Read about known issues in [the troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting).

# Automatic Bootstrapping

If you are using macOS you can use the automatic bootstrapping script that can be piped to bash:

```shell
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/getsentry/bootstrap-sentry/main/bootstrap.sh)
```

This script does more than what's documented on the rest of the page to ensure a somewhat uniform development environment
for Sentry engineers.

# Manual Setup

This will guide you through manually setting up your development environment.

## Clone the Repository

To get started, clone the repo at [https://github.com/getsentry/sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry) or your fork.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/getsentry/sentry.git
cd sentry
```

You're going to be working out of this repository for the remainder of the setup.

## System Dependencies

Let's make sure that your system is ready for Sentry.

### Xcode CLI tools (Mac specific)

You'll need to first install Xcode CLI tools. Run this command and follow the instructions:

```shell
xcode-select --install
```

### Brew

Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh), and then run the following command to install
the various system packages (like docker, openssl, ...) as listed in Sentry's [Brewfile](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/blob/master/Brewfile).

```shell
brew bundle --verbose
```


## Python

Sentry depends on binary Python packages called [Python Wheels](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/binary-distribution-format/#binary-distribution-format), which we distribute for the following platforms:

- Linux (arm64 or x86_64) compatible with [PEP-600](https://peps.python.org/pep-0600/) (``manylinux_2_28)
- macOS 11 (x86_64) or macOS 12 (arm64) or newer

We utilize [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to install and manage Python versions. It got
installed when you ran `brew bundle`.

To install the required version of Python you'll need to run the following command. This will take a while, since your
computer is actually compiling Python!

```shell
make setup-pyenv
```

After this, if you type `which python`, you should see something like `$HOME/.pyenv/shims/python`
rather than `/usr/bin/python`. This is because the following has been added to your start up script:

```shell {tabTitle: Bash}
Given that the bash instructions vary greatly based on the user's
configuration, it is recommended to visit

https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation

for instructions on how to set up Bash.
```

```shell {filename: ~/.zprofile} {tabTitle: Zsh}

# It is assumed that pyenv is installed via Brew, so this is all we need to do.

eval "\$(pyenv init --path)"

```

### Virtual Environment

You're now ready to create a Python virtual environment. Run:

```shell
python -m venv .venv
```

And activate the virtual environment:

```shell {tabTitle: Bash}
source .venv/bin/activate
```

```shell {tabTitle: Zsh}
source .venv/bin/activate
```

If everything worked, running `which python` should now result in something like `/Users/you/sentry/.venv/bin/python`.

## JavaScript

We use [volta](https://github.com/volta-cli/volta) to install and manage the version of Node.js that Sentry requires.
To install Volta run:

```shell
curl https://get.volta.sh | bash
```

The volta installer will tell you to "open a new terminal to start using Volta", but you don't have to! You can just
reload your shell:

```shell
exec "$SHELL"
```

This works because the volta installer conveniently made changes to your shell installation files for your shell's
startup script:

```shell {filename: ~/.bashrc} {tabTitle: Bash}
export VOLTA_HOME="$HOME/.volta"
grep --silent "$VOLTA_HOME/bin" <<< $PATH || export PATH="$VOLTA_HOME/bin:\$PATH"

```

```shell {filename: ~/.zshrc} {tabTitle: Zsh}
export VOLTA_HOME="$HOME/.volta"
grep --silent "$VOLTA_HOME/bin" <<< $PATH || export PATH="$VOLTA_HOME/bin:$PATH"
```

Now, if you try and run `volta`, you should see some help text, meaning volta is installed correctly. To install node,
simply run:

```shell
node -v
```

Volta intercepts this and automatically downloads and installs the node and yarn versions in sentry's `package.json`.

## Bootstrap Services

Source your virtual environment again (`source .venv/bin/activate`), then run:

```shell
make bootstrap
```

This will take a long time, as it bootstraps Sentry, its dependencies, starts up related services and runs database migrations.

The bootstrap command does a few things you'll want to know about:

- `sentry init` creates the baseline Sentry configuration in `~/.sentry/`.
- `sentry devservices up` spins up required Docker services (such as Postgres and Clickhouse)
- `sentry upgrade` runs Postgres migrations, and will also prompt you to create a user. This user will be the **superuser**.

Once this command has finished you'll have Sentry installed in development mode with all its required dependencies.

If the command is done you should see a "Finished bootstrapping!" message.

**Note**: This command is meant to be run only once. If the command fails please remove all existing Docker containers and all Docker volumes with `sentry devservices rm`, and `~/.sentry/` and try running it again.

### (Optional) Bringing your services up-to-date

To bring your dependencies up-to-date do not run `make bootstrap` again but instead run:

```shell
make develop
```

## direnv

[direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv) _automatically activates your virtual environment_, sets some helpful environment
variables for you, and performs some simple checks to make sure your environment is as expected (and tries its best to guide
you if it isn't). This happens every time you change directories into sentry.

First, you should be done bootstrapping. Then, run:

```shell
brew install direnv
```

After direnv is installed add the following snippet to the end of your startup script:

```shell {filename: ~/.bashrc} {tabTitle: Bash}
eval "\$(direnv hook bash)"

```

```shell {filename: ~/.zshrc} {tabTitle: Zsh}
eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"
```

And after doing that, reload your shell:

```shell
exec "$SHELL"
```

Any time the `.envrc` configuration changes (including the first load) you will be prompted to run

```shell
direnv allow
```

before any of the configuration will run. This is for security purposes and you are encouraged to inspect the changes before running this command.

### Customize your development environment variables

If you want to personalize your environment variables, you can do so by creating a `.env` file. This file is
ignored by `git`, thus, you will not be able to leak it into one of your PRs.

Running `make direnv-help` will list all of the latest supported environment variables. Using `SENTRY_DEVENV_NO_REPORT` as an example,
to enable that setting you would insert `SENTRY_DEVENV_NO_REPORT=1` into your `.env` file.

## Running the Development Server

Now you can run the development server at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000):

```shell
sentry devserver --workers
```

If you are developing for aesthetics only and do not rely on the async workers, you can omit the `--workers` flag in order
to use fewer system resources.

If you would like to be able to run `devserver` outside of your root checkout, you can install `webpack` globally with
`npm install -g webpack`.

To create a user, run:

```shell
sentry createuser
```

<Alert title="Note" level="info">
  When asked for the root address of the server, make sure that you use{" "}
  <a href="http://localhost:8000">http://localhost:8000</a>, as both protocol{" "}
  <em>and</em> port are required in order for DNS and some pages' URLs to be
  displayed correctly.
</Alert>

### Frontend Only & Backend Only

Please refer to [Frontend Development Server](/frontend/development-server/) and [Backend Development Server](/backend/development-server/) for alternative ways to bring up the Sentry UI.

### Ingestion Pipeline (Relay)

Some services are not run in all situations. Among those are <Link to="/services/relay/">Relay</Link> and the ingest workers. If you need
a more production-like environment in development, you can set `SENTRY_USE_RELAY=True` in `~/.sentry/sentry.conf.py`. If `sentry devservices` is currently up ,make sure to restart it after you make the change. This will launch Relay
as part of the `devserver` workflow.

Additionally, you can explicitly control this during `devserver` usage with the `--ingest` and `--no-ingest` flags. The `sentry devservices`
command will not update Relay automatically in that case, to do this manually run:

```shell
sentry devservices up --skip-only-if relay
sentry devserver --workers --ingest
```

If you want to enable the entire metrics ingestion pipeline, you need to add the following to your config at `~/.sentry/sentry.conf.py`:

```python
SENTRY_USE_RELAY = True
SENTRY_USE_METRICS_DEV = True
SENTRY_EVENTSTREAM = "sentry.eventstream.kafka.KafkaEventStream"
SENTRY_FEATURES['organizations:metrics-extraction'] = True  # Enables session metrics
SENTRY_FEATURES['organizations:transaction-metrics-extraction'] = True  # Enables transaction metrics
```

## Setting up Getsentry

<Alert title="Employees Only" level="warning">
  Only Sentry employees have access to getsentry.
</Alert>

Now that you have sentry all set up, it's time to set up Getsentry. For information on the distinction between the two,
refer to <Link to="/sentry-vs-getsentry/">Sentry vs Getsentry</Link>. After setting it up, you'll also want to read about
the development workflow <Link to="/workflow/">here</Link>.

Let's start off by cloning the `getsentry` repository to be adjacent to your
`sentry` repository:

```shell
# Go to where you have sentry and clone getsentry.
cd /path/to/sentry
cd ..
git clone git@github.com:getsentry/getsentry.git
```

It's necessary to keep getsentry in an adjacent directory (it's expected by
various make targets in the getsentry Makefile). For example, if you
did a `ls ~/code` you'd see something like:

```shell
sentry/   getsentry/
```

Next, <Link to="#virtual-environment">create a virtual environment</Link> just like how you did with Sentry earlier.

Then, run `make bootstrap` and follow any additional instructions that come up.

If all went well, then you can start the development server:

```shell
getsentry devserver --workers
```

**Note**: You **cannot** have both sentry and getsentry devserver running at the same time.

After the server warms up for a little while, you should be able to access it
at [http://dev.getsentry.net:8000](http://dev.getsentry.net:8000/).

If you see `DoesNotExist: Subscription matching query does not exist` in your dev server,
run the following in getsentry:

```shell
./bin/mock-subscription
```

You can set your local instance's org to use a business plan by running the
following in getsentry:

```shell
./bin/mock-subscription <org_slug> --plan mm2_a_500k
```

If you need to overwrite configuration options for your local
environment, you can create `getsentry/conf/settings/devlocal.py` and put the
configuration option overrides there. This module will be automatically imported
by `dev.py` if it exists.

---

**Problem:** You see an error that mentions something like `pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: The 'some_dependency<0.6.0,>=0.5.5' distribution was not found and is required by sentry`

**Solution:** Your virtualenv needs to be updated. Run `make install-py-dev`.

---

**Problem:** You see `Error occured while trying to proxy to: dev.getsentry.net:8000/`

**Solution:** You likely need to upgrade your Python dependencies. Go to the git root directory and run `make install-py-dev`.

---

**Problem:** `Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'integration-docs-platforms'`

**Solution:**

```shell
make build-platform-assets
```

---

**Problem:** You see `SessionNotCreatedException: Message: session not created: This version of ChromeDriver only supports Chrome version 76`

Or:

```shell
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/joshua.li/dev/sentry/sentry/src/sentry/utils/pytest/selenium.py", line 344, in browser
    driver = start_chrome(**chrome_args)
  File "/Users/joshua.li/dev/sentry/sentry/src/sentry/utils/retries.py", line 41, in execute_with_retry
    return retrier(functools.partial(fn, *args, **kwargs))
  File "/Users/joshua.li/dev/sentry/sentry/src/sentry/utils/retries.py", line 85, in __call__
    error,
RetryException: Could not successfully execute <functools.partial object at 0x10f31e7e0> within 15.830 seconds (12 attempts.)
```

**Solution:**

ChromeDriver needs to be updated.

```shell
brew upgrade --cask chromedriver
```

---

**Problem:**

```shell
--- snip ---
00:51:27 server  | ImportError: cannot import name _remove_dead_weakref
00:51:27 server  | unable to load app 0 (mountpoint='') (callable not found or import error)
```

This is caused by uwsgi running the wrong version of Python. When starting up, you'll see something like

```shell
uwsgi socket 0 bound to TCP address 127.0.0.1:8889 fd 3
Python version: 2.7.10 (default, Feb 22 2019, 21:17:52)  [GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 10.0.1 (clang-1001.0.37.14)]
Set PythonHome to /Users/dfuller/code/sentry/.venv
```

The Python version here should be 2.7.16, but will be a lower version, likely your system Python. This is because uwsgi was
compiled against a stale Python and the resultant wheel has been cached by pip.

**Solution:**

In your sentry virtualenv:

```shell
pip uninstall uwsgi
pip install --no-cache-dir uwsgi
```

---

**Problem:** You see `DoesNotExist: Subscription matching query does not exist`

**Solution:** In getsentry, run the following to mock a subscription:

```shell
./bin/mock-subscription <org_slug>
```

---

**Problem:** You see something like `Error: No such container: sentry_postgres`, or you don't see `sentry_snuba`, `sentry_postgres`, `sentry_clickhouse`, and `sentry_redis` listed under `COMMAND NAMES`.

**Solution:** Review the [bootstrap services](/environment/#bootstrap-services)
section or spin up Docker services with:

```shell
sentry devservices up
```

---

**Problem:** You see something like `Error 61 connecting to 127.0.0.1:6379. Connection refused.` when running your dev server.

**Solution:** Make sure your Docker services are running:

```shell
docker ps
```
