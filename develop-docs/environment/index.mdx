This guide steps you through configuring a local development environment for the Sentry server on macOS. If you're using
another operating system the instructions are still roughly the same, but we don't maintain any official documentation
for anything else for now.

This documentation is meant for Mac OS and Linux. Windows is currently unsupported.

Read about known issues in [the troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting).

## Clone the Repository

To get started, clone the repo at [https://github.com/getsentry/sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry) or your fork.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/getsentry/sentry.git
cd sentry
```

You're going to be working out of this repository for the remainder of the setup.

## System Dependencies

### Xcode CLI tools (Mac specific)

You'll need to first install Xcode CLI tools. Run this command and follow the instructions:

```shell
xcode-select --install
```

### Brew

Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh), and then the following command to install
the various system packages as listed in Sentry's `Brewfile`.

```shell
brew bundle --verbose
```

### Docker (Mac specific)

On Mac, `docker` (which brew has already installed for you under `/Applications/Docker.app`) needs some manual
intervention. You can run this command to set it up automatically for you:

```shell
open -g -a Docker.app
```

You should soon see the Docker icon in your macOS menubar. Docker will automatically run on system restarts,
so this should be the only time you do this.

You can verify that Docker is running by running `docker ps` in your terminal.

## Build Toolchain

Sentry depends on [Python Wheels](https://pythonwheels.com/) (packages containing binary extension modules),
which, we distribute for the following platforms:

- Linux compatible with [PEP-513](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0513/) (`manylinux1`)
- macOS 10.15 or newer

If your development machine does not run one of the above systems, you need to install the Rust
toolchain. Follow the instructions at [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
to install the compiler and related tools. Once installed, the Sentry setup will automatically use Rust to build all
binary modules without additional configuration.

We generally track the latest stable Rust version, which updates every six weeks. Therefore, ensure to keep your Rust
toolchain up to date by occasionally running:

```shell
rustup update stable
```

## Python

We utilize [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to install and manage Python versions. It got
installed when you ran `brew bundle`.

To install the required version of Python you'll need to run the following command. This will take a while, since your
computer is actually compiling Python!

```shell
make setup-pyenv
```

fish users will need to manually set some of the environment variables. This only needs to be done
once.

```shell {tabTitle: Fish}
set -Ux PYENV_ROOT $HOME/.pyenv
# fish >=3.2.0
fish_add_path $PYENV_ROOT/bin
# fish <3.2.0
set -U fish_user_paths $PYENV_ROOT/bin $fish_user_paths
```

Once that's done, your shell needs to be reloaded. You can either reload it in-place, or close your terminal and start it
again and cd into sentry. To reload it, run:

```shell
exec "$SHELL"
```

After this, if you type `which python`, you should see something like `$HOME/.pyenv/shims/python`
rather than `/usr/bin/python`. This is because the following has been added to your start up script:

```shell {tabTitle: Bash}
Given that the bash instructions vary greatly based on the user's configuration, it is recommended to visit https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation for instructions on how to set up Bash.
```

```shell {filename: ~/.zprofile} {tabTitle: Zsh}

# It is assumed that pyenv is installed via Brew, so this is all we need to do.
eval "$(pyenv init --path)"
```

```shell {filename: ~/.config/fish/config.fish} {tabTitle: Fish}
# pyenv init
status is-login; and pyenv init --path | source
```

### Virtual Environment

You're now ready to create a Python virtual environment. Run:

```shell
python -m venv .venv
```

And activate the virtual environment:

```shell {tabTitle: Bash}
source .venv/bin/activate
```

```shell {tabTitle: Zsh}
source .venv/bin/activate
```

```shell {tabTitle: Fish}
source .venv/bin/activate.fish
```

If everything worked, running `which python` should now result in something like `/Users/you/sentry/.venv/bin/python`.

## JavaScript

We use [volta](https://github.com/volta-cli/volta) to install and manage the version of Node.js that Sentry requires.
To install Volta run:

```shell
curl https://get.volta.sh | bash
```

The volta installer will tell you to "open a new terminal to start using Volta", but you don't have to! You can just
reload your shell:

```shell
exec "$SHELL"
```

This works because the volta installer conveniently made changes to your shell installation files for your shell's
startup script:

```shell {filename: ~/.bashrc} {tabTitle: Bash}
export VOLTA_HOME="$HOME/.volta"
grep --silent "$VOLTA_HOME/bin" <<< $PATH || export PATH="$VOLTA_HOME/bin:$PATH"
```

```shell {filename: ~/.zshrc} {tabTitle: Zsh}
export VOLTA_HOME="$HOME/.volta"
grep --silent "$VOLTA_HOME/bin" <<< $PATH || export PATH="$VOLTA_HOME/bin:$PATH"
```

```shell {filename: ~/.config/fish/config.fish} {tabTitle: Fish}
set -gx VOLTA_HOME "$HOME/.volta"
set -gx PATH "$VOLTA_HOME/bin" $PATH
```

Now, if you try and run `volta`, you should see some help text, meaning volta is installed correctly. To install node,
simply run:

```shell
node -v
```

Volta intercepts this and automatically downloads and installs the node and yarn versions in sentry's `package.json`.

## Bootstrap Services

Source your virtual environment again (`source .venv/bin/activate`), then run `make bootstrap`. This will take a long time,
as it bootstraps Sentry, its dependencies, starts up related services and runs database migrations.

The `bootstrap` command does a few things you'll want to know about:

- `sentry init` creates the baseline Sentry configuration in `~/.sentry/`.
- `sentry devservices up` spins up required Docker services (such as Postgres and Clickhouse)
- `sentry upgrade` runs Postgres migrations, and will also prompt you to create a user. You will want to ensure your first
  user is designated as **superuser**.

Once this command has finished you'll have Sentry installed in development mode with all its required dependencies.

**Note**: This command is meant to be run only once. To bring your dependencies up-to-date use `make develop`.

## direnv

[direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv) _automatically activates your virtual environment_, sets some helpful environment
variables for you, and performs some simple checks to make sure your environment is as expected (and tries its best to guide
you if it isn't). This happens every time you change directories into sentry.

First, you should be done bootstrapping. Then, run `brew install direnv` and add the following snippet to the end of your
startup script:

```shell {filename: ~/.bashrc} {tabTitle: Bash}
eval "\$(direnv hook bash)"
```

```shell {filename: ~/.zshrc} {tabTitle: Zsh}
eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"
```

```shell {filename ~/.config/fish/config.fish} {tabTitle: Fish}
direnv hook fish | source
```

And after doing that, reload your shell:

```shell
exec "$SHELL"
```

Any time the `.envrc` configuration changes (including the first load) you will be prompted to run `direnv allow` before any
of the configuration will run. This is for security purposes and you are encouraged to inspect the changes before running this command.

### Customize your development environment variables

If you want to personalize your environment variables, you can do so by creating a `.env` file. This file is
ignored by `git`, thus, you will not be able to leak it into one of your PRs.

Running `make direnv-help` will list all of the latest supported environment variables. Using `SENTRY_DEVENV_NO_REPORT` as an example,
to enable that setting you would insert `SENTRY_DEVENV_NO_REPORT=1` into your `.env` file.

## Running the Development Server

Once youâ€™ve successfully stood up your datastore, you can now run the development server:

```shell
sentry devserver --workers
```

If you are developing for aesthetics only and do not rely on the async workers, you can omit the `--workers` flag in order
to use fewer system resources.

If you would like to be able to run `devserver` outside of your root checkout, you can install `webpack` globally with
`npm install -g webpack`.

<Alert title="Note" level="info">
  When asked for the root address of the server, make sure that you use{" "}
  <a href="http://localhost:8000">http://localhost:8000</a>, as both protocol{" "}
  <em>and</em> port are required in order for DNS and some pages' URLs to be
  displayed correctly.
</Alert>

## Setting up Getsentry

<Alert title="Employees Only" level="warning">
  Only Sentry employees have access to getsentry.
</Alert>

Now that you have sentry all set up, it's time to set up Getsentry. For information on the distinction between the two,
refer to <Link to="/sentry-vs-getsentry/">Sentry vs Getsentry</Link>. After setting it up, you'll also want to read about
the development workflow <Link to="/workflow/">here</Link>.

Let's start off by cloning the `getsentry` repository to be adjacent to your
`sentry` repository:

```shell
# Go to where you have sentry and clone getsentry.
cd /path/to/sentry
cd ..
git clone git@github.com:getsentry/getsentry.git
```

It's necessary to keep getsentry in an adjacent directory (it's expected by
various make targets in the getsentry Makefile). For example, if you
did a `ls ~/code` you'd see something like:

```shell
sentry/   getsentry/
```

Next, <Link to="#virtual-environment">create a virtual environment</Link> just like how you did with Sentry earlier.

Then, run `make bootstrap` and follow any additional instructions that come up.

If all went well, then you can start the development server:

```shell
getsentry devserver --workers
```

**Note**: You **cannot** have both sentry and getsentry devserver running at the same time.

After the server warms up for a little while, you should be able to access it
at [http://dev.getsentry.net:8000](http://dev.getsentry.net:8000/).

If you see `DoesNotExist: Subscription matching query does not exist` in your dev server,
run the following in getsentry:

```shell
./bin/mock-subscription
```

You can set your local instance's org to use a business plan by running the
following in getsentry:

```shell
./bin/mock-subscription <org_slug> --plan mm2_a_500k
```

If you need to overwrite configuration options for your local
environment. You can create `getsentry/conf/settings/devlocal.py` and put the
configuration option overrides there. This module will be automatically imported
by `dev.py` if it exists.

---

**Problem:** You see an error that mentions something like `pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: The 'some_dependency<0.6.0,>=0.5.5' distribution was not found and is required by sentry`

**Solution:** Your virtualenv needs to be updated. Run `make install-py-dev`.

---

**Problem:** You see `Error occured while trying to proxy to: dev.getsentry.net:8000/`

**Solution:** You likely need to upgrade your Python dependencies. Go to the git root directory and run `make install-py-dev`.

---

**Problem:** `Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'integration-docs-platforms'`

**Solution:**

```shell
make build-platform-assets
```

---

**Problem:** You see `SessionNotCreatedException: Message: session not created: This version of ChromeDriver only supports Chrome version 76`

Or:

```shell
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/joshua.li/dev/sentry/sentry/src/sentry/utils/pytest/selenium.py", line 344, in browser
    driver = start_chrome(**chrome_args)
  File "/Users/joshua.li/dev/sentry/sentry/src/sentry/utils/retries.py", line 41, in execute_with_retry
    return retrier(functools.partial(fn, *args, **kwargs))
  File "/Users/joshua.li/dev/sentry/sentry/src/sentry/utils/retries.py", line 85, in __call__
    error,
RetryException: Could not successfully execute <functools.partial object at 0x10f31e7e0> within 15.830 seconds (12 attempts.)
```

**Solution:**

ChromeDriver needs to be updated.

```shell
brew upgrade --cask chromedriver
```

---

**Problem:**

```shell
--- snip ---
00:51:27 server  | ImportError: cannot import name _remove_dead_weakref
00:51:27 server  | unable to load app 0 (mountpoint='') (callable not found or import error)
```

This is caused by uwsgi running the wrong version of Python. When starting up, you'll see something like

```shell
uwsgi socket 0 bound to TCP address 127.0.0.1:8889 fd 3
Python version: 2.7.10 (default, Feb 22 2019, 21:17:52)  [GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 10.0.1 (clang-1001.0.37.14)]
Set PythonHome to /Users/dfuller/code/sentry/.venv
```

The Python version here should be 2.7.16, but will be a lower version, likely your system Python. This is because uwsgi was
compiled against a stale Python and the resultant wheel has been cached by pip.

**Solution:**

In your sentry virtualenv:

```shell
pip uninstall uwsgi
pip install --no-cache-dir uwsgi
```

---

**Problem:** You see `DoesNotExist: Subscription matching query does not exist`

**Solution:** In getsentry, run the following to mock a subscription:

```shell
./bin/mock-subscription <org_slug>
```

---

**Problem:** You see something like `Error: No such container: sentry_postgres`

**Solution:** Review the [bootstrap services](/environment/#bootstrap-services)
section or spin up Docker services with:

```shell
sentry devservices up
```
