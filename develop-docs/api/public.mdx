## Introduction

In this document, we explain both how you make an API public and the considerations to take into
account before doing so.

## Definitions

### Managed Client

A managed client is one that Sentry controls, such as our frontend. In this type of client, we
control both which endpoints are used and the attributes used by those endpoints.

### Partially Managed Client

A partially-managed client is one that we only partially control, since we do not control the
version of the client that is running for our users; for example, our Sentry CLI. While we control
the endpoints the CLI uses, once the CLI is installed and running in a customer's implementation, we
don't control the version of the client a user runs.

### External Client

An external client is a client that Sentry does not control; for example, a script written by a
customer run in their repository, or an integration written using the Integration Platform. For this
type of client, we have no control over the endpoints they choose to use, nor can we require that
they immediately update their endpoint.

### Private API

A private API is an undocumented API. Sentry can make breaking changes to this type of API, and no
one will blink an eye.

### Public API

Our public API is documented at [https://docs.sentry.io/api/](https://docs.sentry.io/api/).

### Private Attributes in a Public Endpoint

You can have private attributes within a public endpoint.

As an example:
[https://docs.sentry.io/api/teams/retrieve-a-team/](https://docs.sentry.io/api/teams/retrieve-a-team/). 
The response has multiple attributes:

```json
{
  "id": "2",
  "slug": "the-interstellar-jurisdiction"
  ...
}
```

Let's say we also return a `nickname` for a team. If what is returned is not documented as a
response in our public documentation, that attribute is a private attribute within a public
endpoint.

### DRF (Django REST Framework)

[Django REST framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) is a powerful and flexible toolkit
for building Web APIs. Sentry APIs are built using DRF.

## API Versioning

Currently, Sentry's API is `v0` and considered to be in draft phase. While we don't expect our
public endpoints to change greatly, keep in mind that our API is still under development.

## Making an endpoint public

When you make an endpoint public, you're committing to always returning at least the set of defined
attributes when that endpoint is called. As a result, the attribute(s) **cannot be removed** from an
endpoint after they are public. Additionally, the type of the attribute **cannot be changed** once
the attribute is public. The reason the attribute and its type cannot be changed is because both
external and managed clients are relying on the public attribute to be returned from that endpoint.

You **can** add attributes to a public endpoint.

## When to make an API public?

Making an API public offers considerable benefits. A public API allows our customers to incorporate
Sentry into their workflows. It also gives Sentry more visibility in our customers' organizations
("Woah that's cool data, where'd it come from?"..."Sentry!"). Remember, however, making an API
public means that once an endpoint is public, you can only add to it: You cannot make _any_ breaking
changes.

As a guide, use these questions:

1. Is the feature for which you're making the public endpoint stable?
2. Will the API change substantially in the future?

If your answers are Yes and No, you're in business - make the endpoint public. Head over to the
[public API checklist](/api/checklist/) and ensure that your endpoint conforms to the checklist.

## How to make an endpoint public?

We use [Open API Spec 3](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) and the
[drf-spectacular](https://drf-spectacular.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html) library to document
our APIs.

**API Documentation consists of**:

1. Declaring the Endpoint Public
2. Sidebar Tab
3. Method Decorator
    - Title
    - Path and Query Parameters
    - Request Schema
    - Success Responses
    - Error Responses
    - Sample Response Body
4. Endpoint Description

We utilize the drf-spectacular's
[`@extend_schema`](https://drf-spectacular.readthedocs.io/en/latest/drf_spectacular.html#drf_spectacular.utils.extend_schema)
decorator to perform the documentation. The sections below outline each step to use this decorator.

### 1. Declaring the Endpoint Public

Declare the endpoint public by setting the `public` attribute with the appropriate HTTP request
methods.

```python
class OrganizationTeamsEndpoint(...):
    public = {"GET", "POST"}
```

### 2. Sidebar Tab

Specify the endpoint's [sidebar tab](https://docs.sentry.io/api/) by using the 
`@extend_schema` decorator on the endpoint class. You can see the current list of tags or add tags
[here](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/blob/master/src/sentry/apidocs/build.py). In the example
below the [endpoint](https://docs.sentry.io/api/teams/create-a-new-team/)
is tagged in the `Teams` sidebar tab.

```python
from drf_spectacular.utils import extend_schema

@extend_schema(tags=["Teams"])
class OrganizationTeamsEndpoint(...):
    public = {"GET", "POST"}
```

### 3. Method Decorator

We utilize another `@extend_schema` decorator on the endpoint function to perform the majority of
the documentation. The code below provides an example of a fully documented endpoint.

```python
@extend_schema(tags=["Teams"])
class OrganizationTeamsEndpoint(...):
    public = {"GET", "POST"}

    @extend_schema(
        operation_id="Create a New Team",
        parameters=[
            GlobalParams.ORG_SLUG,
            GlobalParams.name("The name for the team.", required=True),
            GlobalParams.slug("Optional slug for the team."),
        ],
        request=TeamPostSerializer,
        responses={
            201: TeamSerializer,
            400: RESPONSE_BAD_REQUEST,
            403: RESPONSE_FORBIDDEN,
            404: OpenApiResponse(description="A team with this slug already exists."),
        },
        examples=TeamExamples.CREATE_TEAM,
    )
    def post(self, request, organization, **kwargs):
        """
        Create a new team bound to an organization.
        """
```

#### Title

Specify an `operation_id` that will be shown as the title of the endpoint's page in the
documentation.

```python
@extend_schema(
    operation_id="Create a New Team",
    ...
)
```

#### Path and Query Parameters

Specify the parameters using a list of parameters and serializers.

- You can find existing parameters in this 
  [file](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/blob/master/src/sentry/apidocs/parameters.py). Note
  that the `description` field in `OpenApiParameter` populates the parameter's description in the
  documentation.
- DRF serializers conveniently translate into query parameters. See
  [here](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/blob/0b9b6563bc4e232334cfc71f136a49117171d13f/src/sentry/api/endpoints/organization_stats_v2.py#L145)
  for an example of this.

```python
parameters=[
    GlobalParams.ORG_SLUG,
    GlobalParams.name("The name for the team.", required=True),
    GlobalParams.slug("Optional slug for the team."),
],
```

#### Request Schema

Specify the request serializer.

- Request serializer can generally just be the DRF serializer of endpoint itself. If you need more
  customization or the endpoint doesn't use a serializer, you can use drf-spectacular's
  [inline_serializer](https://drf-spectacular.readthedocs.io/en/latest/drf_spectacular.html#drf_spectacular.utils.inline_serializer)
  to create a one-off serializer.
  See
  [here](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/blob/b04c1c04f1e86bc040a671ad5b545d3b70132140/src/sentry/scim/endpoints/members.py#L434-L440)
  for an example of this.
- If the endpoint has no request body, you can either omit the `request` field or set it to `None`.

```python
request=TeamPostSerializer,
```

#### Success Responses

Specify the return type of success responses, which are used to generate the response schema and 
validate the sample response body. There are three ways to do this:

1. If the success response is a single object instead of a list, you can pass a DRF serializer as
  the response. In order for this serializer to generate a schema, its `serialize` method must be
  typed to return a [TypedDict](https://peps.python.org/pep-0589/). 

  For example, this [sample
  code](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/blob/0b9b6563bc4e232334cfc71f136a49117171d13f/src/sentry/scim/endpoints/members.py#L202)
  has the `200` status code returning an `OrganizationMemberSCIMSerializer`. It's
  [`serialize`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/blob/0b9b6563bc4e232334cfc71f136a49117171d13f/src/sentry/api/serializers/models/organization_member/scim.py#L14-L16)
  method is typed to return an
  [`OrganizationMemberSCIMSerializerResponse`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/blob/0b9b6563bc4e232334cfc71f136a49117171d13f/src/sentry/api/serializers/models/organization_member/response.py#L60)
  TypedDict which specifies the typing of the response body.

  Note that in order indicate optional fields that may or may not be set in the response, you must
  inherit from a TypedDict with `total=False` in it's class header. Optional fields should be
  grouped together and cannot exist in the same class as required fields.
  See
  [here](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/blob/0b9b6563bc4e232334cfc71f136a49117171d13f/src/sentry/api/serializers/models/organization_member/response.py#L53)
  for an example of this.
  ```python
  class ExampleResponseOptional(TypedDict, total=False):
      optionalStringField: str
  ```

  For fields that may be null, use `Optional` followed by the field's type.
  ```python
  class ExampleResponse(TypedDict, ExampleResponseOptional):
      potentiallyNullStringField: Optional[str]
  ```

  Note that a field can be both optional and null.

2. To return a list of objects or for additional customization, use the
  [inline_sentry_response_serializer](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/blob/aa61724035370a47fdc112c14d1467be2609d9a2/src/sentry/apidocs/utils.py#L24)
  function.

  ```python
  from sentry.apidocs.utils import inline_sentry_response_serializer

  @extend_schema(
      responses={
          200: inline_sentry_response_serializer(
              "ListOrgTeamResponse", List[TeamSerializerResponse]
          ),
      }
  )
  ```

  Note that we HIGHLY recommend using the first method when your endpoint returns a single
  object and utilizes an existing serializer. The first method ensures the documentation stays 
  up-to-date as the endpoint evolves, and provides a higher quality API experience for our users.

3. You can also provide OpenAPI JSON if you are running into issues, although we recommend avoiding
   this if possible.

#### Error Responses

Specify error responses using the existing `OpenApiResponse` constants in this
[file](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/blob/master/src/sentry/apidocs/constants.py). You can
also define your own for more detailed messages like the example below.

```python
responses={
    201: TeamSerializer,
    400: RESPONSE_BAD_REQUEST,
    403: RESPONSE_FORBIDDEN,
    404: OpenApiResponse(description="A team with this slug already exists."),
},
```

#### Sample Response Body

Specify the endpoint's sample response using the `examples` field. We keep all our examples in this
[folder](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/tree/master/src/sentry/apidocs/examples) sorted by
sidebar tags. 

```python
@extend_schema(
    ...
    examples=TeamExamples.CREATE_TEAM,
)

from drf_spectacular.types import OpenApiExample

class TeamExamples:
  CREATE_TEAM = [
      OpenApiExample(
          # description of example, not used for anything
          "Create a new team",
          # actual response body
          value={"slug": "my-team", "name": "My Team"},
          # the status code(s) this example applies to
          status_codes=["201"], 
          # You MUST INCLUDE this for all examples
          response_only=True,
      )
  ]
```

- Note that the statment `response_only=True` is required for all examples.
- We currently only support showing one response example per endpoint.

### 4. Endpoint Description

Specify the endpoint description in the documentation using the endpoint's docstring.

```python
def post(self, request, organization, **kwargs):
    """
    Create a new team bound to an organization.
    """
```

### Caveats

- **If the endpoint you're modifying had previous JSON documentation, you must delete the 
old documentation path in [this
file](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/blob/master/api-docs/openapi.json)
and its corresponding JSON build in [this
folder](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/blob/master/api-docs/paths).**

- **Additionally if there are multiple request types in the same endpoint using the old JSON
documentation, you must update both of them in the same PR. Updating only one request and
deleting the old documentation will cause all other requests to disappear from the docs.**

### Building and Testing Locally

**Commands**:

- `make test-api-docs` builds the OpenAPI JSON, validates the schema for all examples, and runs all
  API docs tests.
- `make build-api-docs` builds the OpenAPI JSON. The build will fail if there are any warnings.
- `make diff-api-docs` produces a diff of your local OpenAPI JSON with production.
- `make watch-api-docs` autmatoically rebuilds the OpenAPI JSON on change.

**To see your changes in the docs locally**:

In `sentry`:

1. Use `make watch-api-docs` to continuously build the intermediate asset
   `tests/apidocs/openapi-derefed.json` locally.
2. Copy the full path to `{YOUR_SYSTEM_FOLDER}/tests/apidocs/openapi-derefed.json`, 

  e.g. `/Users/yourname/code/sentry/tests/apidocs/openapi-derefed.json`.

In `sentry-docs`:

1. Run `OPENAPI_LOCAL_PATH=<COPIED_FULL_PATH> DISABLE_THUMBNAILS=1 yarn start` and substitute
   `<COPIED_FULL_PATH>` with the path to your local openapi-derefed.json. 
   
   Unfortunately changes do not automatically reflect in your local server, so you will need to
   rerun this commmand on every change. We hope to add this feature in the future.

See [here](https://docs.sentry.io/contributing/environment/) for detailed doc build instructions.

When you open the pull request, please add a screenshot of the page or pages you're adding.

### Build Process

The openapi-diff test will fail when CI runs on your pull request, this is expected and meant to
highlight the diff. It is not required to merge.

Once you make changes to an endpoint and merge the change into Sentry, a series of GitHub Actions
will be triggered to make your changes automatically go live:

1. The [`openapi` workflow in
   `sentry`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/blob/master/.github/workflows/openapi.yml) updates
   the schema in [sentry-api-schema](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-api-schema) with the
   OpenAPI build artifact.
2. The [`cascade-to-sentry-docs` workflow in
   `sentry-api-schema`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-api-schema/blob/main/.github/workflows/cascade-to-sentry-docs.yml)
   reacts to the push to `main` in (1) by triggering the [`bump-api-schema-sha` workflow in
   `sentry-docs`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-docs/blob/master/.github/workflows/bump-api-schema-sha.yml).
3. The [`bump-api-schema-sha` workflow in
   `sentry-docs`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-docs/blob/master/.github/workflows/bump-api-schema-sha.yml)
   fetches the latest commit SHA from `sentry-api-schema` and writes it into the correct file, then
   makes and merges a PR in `sentry-docs`, which kicks off a deploy via Vercel to
   https://docs.sentry.io/api/.

### Requesting an API to be public

Want an endpoint to be public?

Look at the [issues on sentry with the `Component: API`
label](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Component%3A+API%22).
If a request has already been made to make the endpoint public, give it a thumbs up. If not, create
a [feature request](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/issues/new?template=feature.yml) on Sentry
and add the `Component: API` label.

The team responsible for the endpoint will review the stability of the endpoint. If the endpoint
will not have breaking changes in future, they can determine whether to make it public.

### FAQs

**When should an attribute be `required`?**

An attribute is `required` if it will always be returned by the API.

**What does it mean when a response doesn't have a schema?**

Some endpoints have no response schema. This means that while the endpoint is public, the attributes
within that endpoint can change at any time. This is a relic from migrating the documentation from
our prior approach. Note that, going forward, we recommend new endpoints always provide response
schema.

**I have a question and it has not been answered.**

No problem. Send us an [email](mailto:partners@sentry.io) so we can answer your question.

## Can customers use private endpoints?

Yes, if they wish. However private endpoints are liable to change without notice at any time,
potentially breaking the customer's code. Please be careful using them.
