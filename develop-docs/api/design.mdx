Here are some considerations to make when designing new Sentry APIs. 

## URL Patterns
The API's URL is what developers use to call the endpoint so it‚Äôs important that it is meaningful and clear.

### Don't Exceed 3-level Nesting
Nested resources format like `api/0/organizations/{org}/projects/` is recommended over `api/0/projects/` for readability because it gives user an understanding of resource hierarchy. However, nesting can make URLs too long and hard to use. Sentry uses 3-level nesting as a hybrid solution. 

Here are some possible urls for values with this resource hierarchy: organization -> project -> tag -> value
- üëç `/projects/{organization_slug}/{project_slug}/tags/{tag_id}/values`
- üëé `/organizations/{organization_slug}/projects/{project_slug}/tags/{tag_id}/values/`
- üëé `/values/`

In the above example we flattened `projects`. The table below shows the existing flattened collections which works out with our existing APIs.

| First collection in URL | When to use | Parent | Identifier | Example |
| --- | --------- | ----- | --- | --- |
| organizations | When the resource cannot be attached to any other collection below parent like Project | N/A - always comes as first collection | {organization_slug} | [Create a New Team](https://docs.sentry.io/api/teams/create-a-new-team/) |
| teams | When the resource is under a specific team in the hierarchy | organizations | {organization_slug}/ {team_slug} | [Retreive Team Stats](https://docs.sentry.io/api/teams/retrieve-event-counts-for-a-team/) | 
| projects | When the resource is under a specific project in the hierarchy but not under an issue | organizations | {organization_slug}/ {project_slug} | [Create a New Client Key](https://docs.sentry.io/api/projects/create-a-new-client-key/)|
| issues | When the resource is under a specific issue in the hierarchy | projects | {issue_id} | [List an Issue's Events](https://docs.sentry.io/api/events/list-an-issues-events/)|
| sentry-app-installations | When the resource is mapped to a specific integration | organizations | {integration_slug} | [Delete an External Issue](https://docs.sentry.io/api/integration/delete-an-external-issue/)|
