title: "Configuration"
---

This document describes configuration available to the Sentry server itself.

## First Install

During a new install, Sentry prompts first for a walkthrough of the Installation Wizard. This wizard will help you get a few essential configuration options taken care of before beginning. Once done, you will be left with two files:

<dl>
  <dt><code>config.yml</code></dt>
  <dd>The YAML configuration was introduced in Sentry 8 and will allow you to configure various core attributes. Over time this will be expanded.</dd>

  <dt><code>sentry.conf.py</code></dt>
  <dd>The Python file will be loaded once all other configuration is referenced, and allows you to configure various server settings as well as more complex tuning.</dd>
</dl>

Many settings available in `config.yml` will also be able to be configured in the Sentry UI. Declaring them in the file will generally override the dynamically configured value and prevent it from being changed in the UI. These same settings can also be configured via the `sentry config` CLI helper.

## General

<dl>
  <dt>
    <code>SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT</code>
  </dt>
  <dd>
  Declared in system environment.
  
  The environment name for this installation. This will also control defaults for things like `DEBUG`.

```bash
SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT=production sentry ...
```

</dd>

  <dt>
    <code>system.admin-email</code>
  </dt>
  <dd>
  Declared in <code>config.yml</code>.

The technical contact address for this installation. This will be reported to upstream to the Sentry team (as part of the Beacon), and will be the point of contact for critical updates and security notifications.

```yaml
system.admin-email: "admin@example.com"
```

  </dd>

  <dt><code>system.url-prefix</code></dt>
  <dd><markdown>Declared in <code>config.yml</code>.

The URL prefix in which Sentry is accessible. This will be used both for referencing URLs in the UI, as well as in outbound notifications. This only works for scheme, hostname and port.

```yaml
system.url-prefix: "https://sentry.example.com"
```

</markdown>
</dd>

<dt><code>system.secret-key</code></dt>
<dd><markdown>Declared in `config.yml`.

A secret key used for session signing. If this becomes compromised it’s important to regenerate it as otherwise its much easier to hijack user sessions.

```yaml
system.secret-key: "a-really-long-secret-value"
```

To generate a new value, we’ve provided a helper:

```shell
$ sentry config generate-secret-key
```

</markdown>
</dd>
</dl>

## Logging

Sentry logs to two major places — `stdout`, and its internal project. To disable logging to the internal project, add a logger whose only handler is `'console'` and disable propagating upwards.

<Alert level="warning">
  Explained below are the CLI flag and environment variable. They override the
  root logger and anything in `LOGGING.overridable`. Be very careful with this
  in a production system, because the Celery logger can be extremely verbose
  when set to INFO or DEBUG.
</Alert>

<dl>
<dt><code>-l/--loglevel</code></dt>
<dd><markdown>
Declared on the command line.

Sentry can override logger levels by providing the CLI with the `-l/--loglevel` flag.
The value of this can be one of the [standard Python logging level strings](https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html#levels).

```shell
sentry --loglevel=WARNING
```

</markdown></dd>

<dt><code>SENTRY_LOG_LEVEL</code></dt>
<dd><markdown>Declared in system environment.

Sentry can override logger levels with the `SENTRY_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable.
The value of this can be one of the [standard Python logging level strings](https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html#levels).

```shell
SENTRY_LOG_LEVEL=WARNING sentry ...
```

</markdown></dd>

<dt><code>LOGGING</code></dt>
<dd><markdown>
Declared in `sentry.conf.py`.

You can modify or override the full logging configuration with this setting. Be careful not to remove or override important defaults. You can check [the default configuration](https://git.io/fjjna) for reference.

```python
LOGGING['default_level'] = 'WARNING'
```

</markdown></dd>
</dl>

## Redis

<dl>
<dt><code>redis.clusters</code></dt>
<dd><markdown>
Declared in `config.yml`.

Describes the Redis clusters available to the Sentry server. These clusters may then be referenced by name by other internal services such as the cache, digests, and TSDB backends, among others.

For example,

```yaml
redis.clusters:
  default: # cluster name
    hosts: # connection options, passed to `rb.Cluster`
      0:
        host: redis-1.example.com
        port: 6379
      1:
        host: redis-2.example.com
        port: 6379
  other:
    hosts:
      0:
        host: redis-3.example.com
        port: 6379
```

</markdown>
</dd>
</dl>

## Authentication

The following keys control the authentication support.

`SENTRY_FEATURES['auth:register']`

: Declared in `sentry.conf.py`.

Should Sentry allow users to create new accounts?

Defaults to `True` (can register).

```python
SENTRY_FEATURES['auth:register'] = True
```

`SENTRY_PUBLIC`

: Declared in `sentry.conf.py`.

Should Sentry make all data publicly accessible? This should **only** be used if you’re installing Sentry behind your company’s firewall.

Users will still need to have an account to view any data.

Defaults to `False`.

```python
SENTRY_PUBLIC = True
```

`SENTRY_ALLOW_ORIGIN`

: Declared in `sentry.conf.py`.

If provided, Sentry will set the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to this value on /api/store/ responses. In addition, the Access-Control-Allow-Headers header will be set to ‘X-Sentry-Auth’. This allows JavaScript clients to submit cross-domain error reports.

You can read more about these headers in the [Mozilla developer docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS).

Defaults to `None` (don’t add the Access-Control headers)

```python
SENTRY_ALLOW_ORIGIN = "http://foo.example"
```

## Web Server

The following settings are available for the built-in webserver:

`SENTRY_WEB_HOST`

: Declared in `sentry.conf.py`.

The hostname which the webserver should bind to.

Defaults to `localhost`.

```python
SENTRY_WEB_HOST = '0.0.0.0'  # bind to all addresses
```

`SENTRY_WEB_PORT`

: Declared in `sentry.conf.py`.

The port which the webserver should listen on.

Defaults to `9000`.

```python
SENTRY_WEB_PORT = 9000
```

`SENTRY_WEB_OPTIONS`

: Declared in `sentry.conf.py`.

A dictionary of additional configuration options to pass to uwsgi.

Defaults to `{}`.

```python
SENTRY_WEB_OPTIONS = {
    'workers': 10,
    'buffer-size': 32768,
}
```

Additionally, if you’re using SSL, you’ll want to configure the following settings in `sentry.conf.py`:

```python
SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER = ('HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO', 'https')
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True
CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True
```

## GitHub App Integration
