This guide steps you through instrumenting your code with Sentry's 3rd-party analytics infrastructure.

## Big Query

Send events to Big Query and run queries in [Redash](https://redash.getsentry.net/).

Create a new file in `src/sentry/analytics/events` using the key in snake case as the filename.

In this file, you will need to register the event with attributes (for validation).
```python
from sentry import analytics

class CodeownersAssignment(analytics.Event):
    type = "codeowners.assignment" # replace with your key

    attributes = (
        analytics.Attribute("organization_id"),
        analytics.Attribute("project_id"),
        analytics.Attribute("group_id"),
        # more attributes
    )

analytics.register(CodeownersAssignment)
```

Now in the code that you want instrumented, use the `analytics.record` function with the registered key.
```python 
from sentry import analytics

analytics.record(
    "codeowners.assignment", # replace with your key
    organization_id=project.organization_id,
    project_id=project.id,
    group_id=group.id,
    # more attributes
)
```

## Metrics

Track aggregrate stats with [Metrics](/services/metrics/). For example, this can be used to track aggregate response codes for an endpoint.

Import the metrics library and use the `metrics.inc` function. The key needs to be unique.

```python
from sentry.utils import metrics

metrics.incr(
    "codeowners.create.http_response", # needs to be unique
    sample_rate=1.0,
    tags={"status": status},
)
```
If you don't put a sample rate, you get 1 in 10 events. If the service is expected to have low traffic, we can start with a sample rate of 1.
