<Alert title="Note" level="info">

This is the recommended way to send metrics. We want to dogfood SDK methods to feel the ergonomics and the experience our customers will get.

</Alert>

## Using Python SDK

In case you are looking to use the new metrics feature directly from the Python SDK you can do it as follows.

First, you have to use at least the `1.34.0` version of the `sentry-python` SDK and add that as your dependency. For example:

```
sentry-sdk @ 1.34.0
```

Once the SDK is installed you have to add experimental flag into your SDK init:

```python
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    # ...
    _experiments={
      "enable_metrics": True,
    },
    # ...
)
```

Ensure you have [feature flags for both ingestion and UI](/delightful-developer-metrics/ui/#enabling-the-ui) enabled.

Then you can use the metrics method as follows:

```python
from sentry_sdk import metrics

# Emit a counter
metrics.incr(
    key="my_counter",
    value=2,
    tags=tags,
)

# Emit a distribution
metrics.distribution(
    key="my_distribution",
    value=15.0,
    tags=tags,
    # You can also specify a unit if you want
    unit="second",
)

# Emit a set
metrics.set(
    key="my_set",
    value="john",
    tags=tags,
)

# Emit a gauge
metrics.gauge(
    key="my_gauge",
    value=10,
    tags=tags,
)
```
If you want to measure how much time a specific piece of code takes, you can use:

```python
from sentry_sdk import metrics

# Emit a distribution metric of the execution time of the function.
with metrics.timer("my_timer"):
    pass

@metrics.timer("my_timer")
def my_function():
    pass
```

<Alert title="Warning" level="warning">

The current metrics sample rate is 5% with the goal of getting to 100% soon.

</Alert>

<Alert title="Note" level="note">
As of now, only the Python SDK is supporting the new metrics features but we are working on supporting metrics in the JavaScript and Rust SDKs next.
</Alert>

## Units Support

The following units are supported out of the box (but the system also allows you to pass your own unit if you need):

```bash
"nanosecond",
"microsecond",
"millisecond",
"second",
"minute",
"hour",
"day",
"week",
"bit",
"byte",
"kilobyte",
"kibibyte",
"megabyte",
"mebibyte",
"gigabyte",
"gibibyte",
"terabyte",
"tebibyte",
"petabyte",
"pebibyte",
"exabyte",
"exbibyte",
"ratio",
"percent",
"none"
```

<Alert title="Note" level="note">

Please note that if you change the unit of a metric, it will be extracted as a new metric.

</Alert>

## Automatic Tags Extraction

Since DDM has the goal of being tightly integrated into Sentry, the `sentry-python` implementation already automatically adds the following tags to your metric:

- `transaction`
- `release`
- `environment`

*As we will see later on, these special tags are recognized by the DDM UI and will prompt you with helpful actions.*
