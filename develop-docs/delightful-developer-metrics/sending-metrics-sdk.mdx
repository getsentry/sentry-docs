<Alert title="Note" level="info">

This is the recommended way to send metrics. We want to dogfood SDK methods to feel the ergonomics and the experience our customers will get.

</Alert>

## Using Python SDK

In case you are looking to use the new metrics feature directly from the Python SDK you can do it as follows.

First, you have to use at least the `1.34.0` version of the `sentry-python` SDK and add that as your dependency. For example:

```
sentry-sdk @ 1.34.0
```

Once the SDK is installed you have to add experimental flag into your SDK init:

```python
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    # ...
    _experiments={
      "enable_metrics": True,
    },
    # ...
)
```

Ensure you have [feature flags for both ingestion and UI](/delightful-developer-metrics/ui/#enabling-the-ui) enabled.

Then you can use the metrics method as follows:

```python
import sentry_sdk

# Emit a counter
sentry_sdk.metrics.incr(
  key="my_counter",
  value=2,
  tags=tags,
)

# Emit a distribution
sentry_sdk.metrics.distribution(
  key="my_distribution",
  value=15.0,
  tags=tags,
	# You can also specify a unit if you want
	unit="second",
)

# Emit a set
sentry_sdk.metrics.set(
  key="my_set",
  value="john",
  tags=tags,
)

# Emit a gauge
sentry_sdk.metrics.gauge(
  key="my_gauge",
  value=10,
  tags=tags,
)
```

<Alert title="Note" level="note">
As of now, only the Python SDK is supporting the new metrics features but we are working on supporting metrics in the JavaScript and Rust SDKs next.
</Alert>

## Units Support

The following units are supported out of the box (but the system also allows you to pass your own unit if you need):

```bash
"nanosecond",
"microsecond",
"millisecond",
"second",
"minute",
"hour",
"day",
"week",
"bit",
"byte",
"kilobyte",
"kibibyte",
"megabyte",
"mebibyte",
"gigabyte",
"gibibyte",
"terabyte",
"tebibyte",
"petabyte",
"pebibyte",
"exabyte",
"exbibyte",
"ratio",
"percent",
"none"
```

<Alert title="Note" level="note">

Please note that if you change the unit of a metric, it will be extracted as a new metric.

</Alert>

## Automatic Tags Extraction

Since DDM has the goal of being tightly integrated into Sentry, the `sentry-python` implementation already automatically adds the following tags to your metric:

- `transaction`
- `release`
- `environment`

*As we will see later on, these special tags are recognized by the DDM UI and will prompt you with helpful actions.*
