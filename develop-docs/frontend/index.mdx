title: Frontend Handbook
---

This guide covers how we write frontend code at Sentry, and is specifically focussed on the [Sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry) and [Getsentry](https://github.com/getsentry/getsentry) codebases. It assumes you are using the eslint rules outlined by [eslint-config-sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/eslint-config-sentry); hence code style enforced by these linting rules will not be discussed here.

## Directory structure

The frontend codebase is currently located under `static/app` in sentry and `static/getsentry` in getsentry.

## Folder & File structure

### File Naming

- Name a file meaningfully, based on how the module's functions, or classes are used or the application section they are used in.
- Unless necessary, don't use prefixes or suffixes (ie. `dataScrubbingEditModal`, `dataScrubbingAddModal`) instead favor names like `dataScrubbing/editModal`.

### Using `index.(j|t)sx?$`

> Having an `index` file in a folder provides a way to implicitly import the main file without specifying it

The use of an index file should comply with the following rules:

- If the folder is created to group components that are used together, and there is an entrypoint component, that uses the components within the grouping (examples, avatar, idBadge). The entrypoint component should be the index file.

- *Don't* use an `index.(j|t)sx?$` file if the folder contains components used in other parts of the app regardless of the entrypoint file. (ie, actionCreators, panels)

- *Don't* use an index file just to re-export. Prefer importing individual components instead.

## React

### Defining React components

New components should be created as functional components, using function declarations instead of arrow functions. 
Props should be declared above the component.

```typescript
type Props = {
  author: object;
  content: string;
  onEdit: (value: string) => void;
};

function Note(props: Props) {
  // use destructuring assignment for props
  const {author, content, onEdit} = props;
  
  handleChange = value => {
    const user = ConfigStore.get('user');

    if (user.isSuperuser) {
      onEdit(value);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div onChange={handleChange}>{content}</div>
  );
}

export default Note;
```

### Components vs views

Both the `app/components/` and `app/views` folders contain React components.

- Use a view for UI that will typically not be reused in other parts of the codebase
- Use a component for UI that is designed to be highly reusable.

### Event handlers

We use different prefixes to better distinguish event handlers from event callback props.

Use the `handle` prefix for event handlers, e.g:

```javascript
<Button onClick={this.handleDelete}/>
```

For event callback props passed to the component use the `on` prefix, e.g:

```javascript
<Button onClick={this.props.onDelete}>
```

## CSS and Emotion

* Use Emotion, use the `theme` object.
* The best styles are ones you don’t write - whenever possible use existing components.
* New code should use the css-in-js library [e m o t i o n](https://emotion.sh/) - it lets you bind styles to elements without the indirection of global selectors. You don’t even need to open another file!
* Take constants (z-indexes, paddings, colors) from [props.theme](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/blob/master/src/sentry/static/sentry/app/utils/theme.jsx)

```javascript
import styled from 'react-emotion';

const SomeComponent = styled('div')`
  border-radius: 1.45em;
  font-weight: bold;
  z-index: ${p => p.theme.zIndex.modal};
  padding: ${p => p.theme.grid}px ${p => p.theme.grid * 2}px;
  border: 1px solid ${p => p.theme.borderLight};
  color: ${p => p.theme.purple};
  box-shadow: ${p => p.theme.dropShadowHeavy};
`;

export default SomeComponent;
```

### `stylelint` Errors

#### "No duplicate selectors"
This happens when you use a styled component as a selector, we need to tell stylelint that what we are interpolating is a selector by using comments to assist the linter. e.g.

```javascript

const ButtonBar = styled("div")`
  ${/* sc-selector */Button) {
     border-radius: 0;
  }
`;
```

See https://styled-components.com/docs/tooling#interpolation-tagging for other tags and more information.

## State management

We currently use [Reflux](https://github.com/reflux/refluxjs) for managing global state.

Reflux implements the unidirectional data flow pattern outlined by [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/). Stores are registered under `app/stores` and are used to store various pieces of data used by the application. Actions need to be registered under `app/actions`. We use action creator functions (under `app/actionCreators`) to dispatch actions. Reflux stores listen to actions and update themselves accordingly.

We are currently exploring alternatives to the `Reflux` library for future use.

## Testing

<Alert level="info">
  For React Testing Library (RTL) tips check out <Link to="/frontend/using-rtl/">this page</Link>.
</Alert>

Note: Your filename needs to be `.spec.tsx` for jest to run run it!

We have useful fixtures defined in [setup.ts](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/blob/master/tests/js/setup.ts) Use these! If you are defining mock data in a repetitive way, it’s probably worth adding this this file. routerContext is a particularly useful one for providing the context object that most view are written to rely on.

`Client.addMockResponse()` is the best way to mock API requests. it’s [our code](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/blob/master/static/app/__mocks__/api.tsx) so if it’s confusing you, just put `console.log()` statements into its logic!

Marking your test method `async` and using the `await tick();` utility can let the event loop flush run events and fix this:

```javascript
wrapper.find('ExpandButton').simulate('click');
await tick();
expect(wrapper.find('CommitRow')).toHaveLength(2);
```

### Selectors

If you are writing jest tests, you can use a Component (and Styled Component) names as a selector. Additionally, if you need to use a DOM query selector, use `data-test-id` instead of a class name. We currently don’t, but it is something we can use babel to strip out during the build process.

## Babel Syntax Plugins
We have decided to only use ECMAScript proposals that are in stage 3 (or later) (See [TC39 Proposals](https://github.com/tc39/proposals)). Additionally, because we are migrating to typescript, we will align with what their compiler supports.
The only exception to this are decorators.

## New Syntax

### Optional Chaining

[Optional chaining](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-optional-chaining) helps us access [nested] objects without having to check for existence before each property/method access. If we try to access a property of an `undefined` or `null` object, it will stop and return `undefined`.

#### Syntax

The Optional Chaining operator is spelled `?.`. It may appear in three positions:

```
obj?.prop       // optional static property access
obj?.[expr]     // optional dynamic property access
func?.(...args) // optional function or method call
```

### Nullish Coalescing

This is a way to set a "default" value. e.g. previously you would do something like

```javascript
let x = volume || 0.5;
```

Which is a problem since `0` is a valid value for `volume`, but because it evaluates to `false` -y, we do not short circuit the expression and the value of `x` is `0.5`

If instead we used [nullish coalescing](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-nullish-coalescing)

```javascript
let x = volume ?? 0.5
```

It will only default to `0.5` if `volume` is `null` or `undefined`.

#### Syntax
Base case. If the expression at the left-hand side of the ?? operator evaluates to undefined or null, its right-hand side is returned.

```javascript
const response = {
  settings: {
    nullValue: null,
    height: 400,
    animationDuration: 0,
    headerText: '',
    showSplashScreen: false
  }
};

const undefinedValue = response.settings.undefinedValue ?? 'some other default'; // result: 'some other default'
const nullValue = response.settings.nullValue ?? 'some other default'; // result: 'some other default'
const headerText = response.settings.headerText ?? 'Hello, world!'; // result: ''
const animationDuration = response.settings.animationDuration ?? 300; // result: 0
const showSplashScreen = response.settings.showSplashScreen ?? true; // result: false
```

## Lodash

Be sure to not import `lodash` utilities using the default `lodash` package. There is an `eslint` rule to make sure this does not happen. Instead, import the utility directly, e.g. `import isEqual from 'lodash/isEqual';`.

Previously we used a combination of [lodash-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash-webpack-plugin) and [babel-plugin-lodash](https://github.com/lodash/babel-plugin-lodash) but it is easy to overlook these plugins and configuration when trying to use a new lodash utility (e.g. [this PR](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/13834)). With `webpack` tree shaking and `eslint` enforcement, we should be able to maintain reasonable bundle sizes.

See [this PR](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/15521) for more information.

We prefer using optional chaining and nullish coalescing over `get` from `loadash/get`.
