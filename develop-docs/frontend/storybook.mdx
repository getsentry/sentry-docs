title: Storybook Styleguide
---

Citing its documentation, “Storybook is a UI development environment for your UI
components. With it, you can visualize different states of your UI components
and develop them interactively.”

More details here: [https://storybook.js.org/](https://storybook.js.org/)

## Do we use it?

Yes! We use Storybook for
the [getsentry/sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/) project.
Storybook’s configuration can be found
in [https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/tree/master/.storybook](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/tree/master/.storybook).

To run Storybook locally, run `npm run storybook` in the root of your
getsentry/sentry repository.

## Is it deployed somewhere?

Sentry’s Storybook is built as a Travis job and deployed to a private Google
Cloud Storage bucket. If your git branch has been tested by Travis, is also has
had its Storybook uploaded.

You can find all uploaded branches here: [http://storybook.getsentry.net/branches/](http://storybook.getsentry.net/branches/)

For convenience, you will be redirected to the master branch when
visiting [http://storybook.getsentry.net/](http://storybook.getsentry.net/)

One thing to keep in mind: branch names are preprocessed before assets uploading
in order to get rid of slashes and other special characters. For example,
branch `feature/hello#,123` will be deployed
to [http://storybook.getsentry.net/branches/feature-hello123](http://storybook.getsentry.net/branches/feature-hello123)
