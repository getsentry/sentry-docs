title: Storybook Styleguide

Citing its documentation, “Storybook is a UI development environment for your UI
components. With it, you can visualize different states of your UI components
and develop them interactively.”

More details here: [https://storybook.js.org/](https://storybook.js.org/)

## Do we use it?

Yes! We use Storybook for
the [getsentry/sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/) project.
Storybook’s configuration can be found
in [https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/tree/master/.storybook](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/tree/master/.storybook).

To run Storybook locally, run `npm run storybook` in the root of your
getsentry/sentry repository.

## Is it deployed somewhere?

[Sentry’s Storybook](https://storybook.sentry.dev/) is built and deployed using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). Each Pull Request will have its own deployment and each push to the main branch will be deployed to [https://storybook.sentry.dev](https://storybook.sentry.dev).
