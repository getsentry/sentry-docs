Running the Sentry Setup Wizard locally alongside your local Sentry instance allows testing both the **Wizard UI** and **Wizard CLI** end-to-end. Follow these steps to get your local environment up and running, and keep it in sync while making changes.

---

#### 1. Set up your local `sentry-wizard`

Clone the [`getsentry/sentry-wizard`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-wizard) repository if you haven't already:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-wizard.git
cd path/to/sentry-wizard
```

Install dependencies and build the wizard to make it usable locally:

```bash
yarn install
yarn build
```

---

#### 2. Link the wizard to your local Sentry repository

Still in the `sentry-wizard` repository, link the wizard package to your local Sentry repository:

```bash
yarn link
```

Then, inside your local Sentry repository, link the wizard package:

```bash
cd path/to/sentry
yarn link @sentry/wizard
```

This ensures the local Sentry instance uses your in-development wizard instead of fetching a published version.

---

#### 3. Automatically rebuild the wizard when changes are made

While developing, keep the wizard up to date by running:

```bash
cd path/to/sentry-wizard
yarn build:watch
```

This watches for code changes and rebuilds the wizard automatically, so your local Sentry always runs the latest version.

---

#### 4. Ensure your local Sentry instance is running

Before running the wizard, make sure a local Sentry devserver is up and running:

```bash
cd path/to/sentry
devservices up
devservices serve
```

By default, the devserver runs at `http://dev.getsentry.net:8000`. Keep this terminal open while testing the wizard.

---

#### 5. Run the wizard against your local Sentry instance

Still in the Sentry repository, run the wizard with the URL of your instance:

```bash
sentry-wizard --url http://dev.getsentry.net:8000
```

This allows you to test both the **Wizard UI** and **Wizard CLI** with your local setup.
