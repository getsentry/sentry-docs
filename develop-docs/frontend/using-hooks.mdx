title: Using Hooks
---

To help make components easier to re-use and simpler to understand, React
and the React ecosystem have been trending towards functional components and
hooks. Hooks are a convenient way to add state and side-effects to functional
components. They also provide a convenient way for libraries to expose behavior.

While we are generally in favor of hooks, we have some recommendations about how
hooks should be used with the Sentry front-end.

### Using hooks from libraries

If a library provides hooks you should use them. Often this will be the only way
to consume a library. For example `dnd-kit` exposes all of its primitives via
hooks and we should use the library the way it was intended to be used.

We don't prefer libraries that use or don't use hooks. Instead favor libraries
with cleaner, simpler APIs, and smaller bundle sizes over ones with larger more
complex APIs or larger bundle sizes.

### Using react's built-in hooks

The `useState`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, `useContext`, `useReducer` and `useRef` hooks are welcome
in any functional component. They are generally a good choice in presentational
components that need a small amount of state, or access to react primitives like
references and context. For example, a component with a slide-out or expandable
state.

The `useEffect` hook is more complex and you need to be careful to track your
dependencies and ensure that subscriptions are canceled through a cleanup
callback.

### Using context

The `useContext` hook provides a simpler implemtation option to share state and 
behavior compared to our previous uses of Reflux. When you need to create new
sources of shared state, consider using context and `useContext` instead of Reflux.
Additionally the [wormhole state management
pattern](https://swizec.com/blog/wormhole-state-management) can be leveraged to 
expose shared state and mutation functions.

### Using custom hooks

Custom hooks can be created to share reusable logic in the application. When creating a custom hook, 
the function name must follow the convention, starting with "use" (`useTheme`, for example) 
and it's fine to call other hooks inside of custom hooks.

Custom hooks are a great way to encapsulate logic, so your component(s) can remain focused 
on presentation only. Read more about [Reusing Logic with Custom Hooks](https://react.dev/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks) on react.dev

### Be aware of the rules and caveats of hooks

React hooks have [a few rules](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html). Be
aware of the rules and limitations that hooks create. We use the ESLint rules to
prevent most of the hook rules from being trespassed.
