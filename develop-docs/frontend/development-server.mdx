title: Frontend Development Server
---

(*see also: [Backend Development Server](/backend/development-server/)*)

You have the ability to only run a frontend development server that will proxy all API requests to Sentry's production servers. In order to do so, run the following command:

```shell
yarn dev-ui
```

The development server can be viewed at [https://dev.getsentry.net:7999](https://dev.getsentry.net:7999). `dev.getsentry.net` is an alias for `localhost` and it's preferred because it supports subdomains. You can also create your own domain alias, as with ngrok, if you like.

In any case, you can now login to your development server with your Sentry.io credentials. The SSO-login flow will *NOT* work. Only email/password is supported on the login form in development.

While the SSO-login flow will not work, cookies from an existing logged-in sessions will work correctly. You may use our [Cookie Sync](https://github.com/getsentry/cookie-sync) browser extension to sync session cookies from `*.sentry.io` domain and into `*.dev.getsentry.net` domain in your browser.

## Troubleshooting

### "Your connection is not private"

If you see an error similar to the below when accessing the development server:

![your connection is not private example](../img/connectionNotPrivate.png)

You can either grant a temporary exception in your browser, or create and install a local certificate and use your OS to mark them as "trusted". The instructions below will show you how to create and install a local certificate.

We will be using [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) to create and install a locally-trusted, development certificate. The following will install `mkcert` and then create and install the local certificates.

```shell
brew install mkcert
brew install nss # if you use Firefox
yarn mkcert-localhost
```

You can now run the dev server with `yarn dev-ui` and open [https://localhost:7999](https://localhost:7999). There should not see a warning about your connection not being private. You should also see a lock or similar icon in the address bar of your browser.

![lock icon in address bar](../img/addressBarLockIcon.png)

**NOTE**: For Firefox users that use the master password you will be prompted for it with this message: "Enter Password or Pin for "NSS Certificate DB":"

**NOTE**: Webpack outputs the IP from where the SPA is being served (e.g. `https://192.168.0.200:7999/`). Do not use it or you will still get the message above. The generated local certificates are only for `localhost`, `127.0.0.1` and `dev.getsentry.net`: Any of these values would work.
