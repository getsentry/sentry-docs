title: Migration - grid-emotion
---

[grid-emotion](https://github.com/emotion-js/grid-emotion) has been deprecated for over a year now, the new project is [reflexbox](https://rebassjs.org/reflexbox/). In order to upgrade to the newest version of [emotion](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion) we need to migrate off of `grid-emotion`.

To migrate, replace the imported `<Flex>` and `<Box>` components with a styled component using `emotion`.

## components
Replace the components with below and then remove the necessary props and move to the styled component.

### `<Flex>`

```
const Flex = styled('div')`
  display: flex;
`;
```

### `<Box>`

```
const Box = styled('div')`
`;
```
## props

If you are modifying a component that is exported, be sure to grep through the codebase for the component to make sure that it is not being rendererd with additional props specific to `grid-emotion`. Examples are the `<Panel>` components.

### margin and padding

Margin props begin with `m` and padding with `p`. The examples below will be using margin as an example

| old (grid-emotion) | new (css/emotion/styled) |
| -------------------| -------------------------|
| `m={2}`            |`margin: ${space(2);` |
| `mx={2}`           |`margin-left: ${space(2); margin-right: ${space(2)};` |
| `my={2}`           |`margin-top: ${space(2); margin-bottom: ${space(2)};`|
| `ml={2}`           |`margin-left: ${space(2);` |
| `mr={2}`           |`margin-right: ${space(2);` |
| `mt={2}`           |`margin-top: ${space(2);` |
| `mb={2}`           |`margin-bottom: ${space(2);` |

### flexbox

These are flexbox props

| old (grid-emotion) | new (css/emotion/styled) |
| -------------------| -------------------------|
| `align="center"` | `align-items: center;`
| `justify="center"` | `justify-content: center;`
| `direction="column"` | `flex-direction: column;`
| `wrap="wrap"` | `flex-wrap: wrap;`

### width (as an array)

TBD - for now just ignore the import statement of `grid-emotion` e.g. `// eslint-disable-line no-restricted-imports`
