title: Using React Testing Library
---

Our tests are written using React Testing Library. In this guide, you'll find tips to follow best practices and avoid common pitfalls.

We have two ESLint rules in place to help with this:

- [eslint-plugin-jest-dom](https://github.com/testing-library/eslint-plugin-jest-dom)
- [eslint-plugin-testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/eslint-plugin-testing-library)

We strive to write tests in a way that closely resembles how our application is used.

Rather than dealing with instances of rendered components, we query the DOM in the same way the user would.
We find form elements by their label text (just like a user would), we find links and buttons from their text (like a user would).

As a part of this goal, we avoid testing implementation details so refactors (changes to implementation but not functionality) don't break the tests.

We are generally in favor of Use Case Coverage over Code Coverage.

## Querying

- use `getBy...` as much as possible
- use `queryBy...` only when checking for non-existence
- use `await findBy...` only when expecting an element to appear after a change to the DOM that might not happen immediately

To ensure that the tests resemble how users interact with our code we recommend the following priority for querying:

1. `getByRole` - This should be the go-to selector for almost everything. As a nice bonus with this selector, we make sure that our app is accessible. It will most likely be used together with the name option `getByRole('button', {name: /save/i})`. The name is usually the label of a form element or the text content of a button, or the value of the aria-label attribute. If unsure, use the [logRoles](https://testing-library.com/docs/dom-testing-library/api-accessibility/#logroles) feature or consult the [list of available roles](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques#roles).
2. `getByLabelText`/`getByPlaceholderText` - Users find form elements using label text, therefore this option is prefered when testing forms.
3. `getByText` - Outside of forms, text content is the main way users find elements. This method can be used to find non-interactive elements (like divs, spans, and paragraphs).
4. `getByTestId` - As this does not reflect how users interact with the app, it is only recommended for cases where you can't use any other selector

If you still have trouble deciding which query to use, check out [testing-playground.com](https://testing-playground.com/) together with the `screen.logTestingPlaygroundURL()` and their [browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/testing-playground/hejbmebodbijjdhflfknehhcgaklhano).

Do not forget, that you can drop `screen.debug()` anywhere in your test to see the current DOM.

## Tips

Avoid destructuring query functions from render method, use `screen` instead ([examples](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/29312)).
You won't have to keep the render call destructure up-to-date as you add/remove the queries you need. You only need to type `screen` and let your editor's autocomplete take care of the rest.

```javascript
import { render, screen } from "sentry-test/reactTestingLibrary";

// ❌
const { getByRole } = render(<Example />);
const errorMessageNode = getByRole("alert");

// ✅
render(<Example />);
const errorMessageNode = screen.getByRole("alert");
```

Avoid using `queryBy...` for anything except checking for non-existence ([examples](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/29517)).
The `getBy...` and `findBy...` variants will throw a more helpful error message if no element is found.

```javascript
import { render, screen } from "sentry-test/reactTestingLibrary";

// ❌
render(<Example />);
expect(screen.queryByRole("alert")).toBeInTheDocument();

// ✅
render(<Example />);
expect(screen.getByRole("alert")).toBeInTheDocument();
expect(screen.queryByRole("button")).not.toBeInTheDocument();
```

Avoid using `waitFor` for waiting on appearance, use `findBy...` instead ([examples](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/29544)).
These two are basically equivalent (`findBy...` even uses `waitFor` under the hood), but the `findBy...` is simpler and the error message we get will be better.

```javascript
import {render, screen, waitFor} from "sentry-test/reactTestingLibrary";

// ❌
render(<Example />);
await waitFor(() => {
  expect(screen.getByRole("alert")).toBeInTheDocument();
});

// ✅
render(<Example />);
expect(await screen.findByRole("alert")).toBeInTheDocument();
```

Avoid using `waitFor` for waiting on disappearance, use `waitForElementToBeRemoved` instead ([examples](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/29547)).
The latter uses `MutationObserver` which is more efficient than polling the DOM at regular intervals with waitFor.

```javascript
import {
  render,
  screen,
  waitFor,
  waitForElementToBeRemoved,
} from "sentry-test/reactTestingLibrary";

// ❌
render(<Example />);
await waitFor(() =>
  expect(screen.queryByRole("alert")).not.toBeInTheDocument()
);

// ✅
render(<Example />);
await waitForElementToBeRemoved(() => screen.getByRole("alert"));
```

Prefer using jest-dom assertions ([examples](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/29508)). The advantages of using these recommended assertions are better error messages, overall semantics, consistency, and uniformity.

```javascript
import {render, screen} from "sentry-test/reactTestingLibrary";

// ❌
render(<Example />);
expect(screen.getByRole("alert")).toBeTruthy();
expect(screen.getByRole("alert").textContent).toEqual("abc");
expect(screen.queryByRole("button")).toBeFalsy();
expect(screen.queryByRole("button")).toBeNull();

// ✅
render(<Example />);
expect(screen.getByRole("alert")).toBeInTheDocument();
expect(screen.getByRole("alert")).toHaveTextContent("abc");
expect(screen.queryByRole("button")).not.toBeInTheDocument();
```

Prefer using case insensitive regex when searching by text. It will make the tests slightly more resilient to change.

```javascript
import {render, screen} from "sentry-test/reactTestingLibrary";

// ❌
render(<Example />);
expect(screen.getByText("Hello World")).toBeInTheDocument();

// ✅
render(<Example />);
expect(screen.getByText(/hello world/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
```

Use `userEvent` over `fireEvent` where possible.
`userEvent` comes from the package `@testing-library/user-event` which is built on top of `fireEvent`, but it provides several methods that resemble the user interactions more closely.

```javascript
// ❌
import {render, screen, fireEvent} from "sentry-test/reactTestingLibrary";
render(<Example />);
fireEvent.change(screen.getByLabelText("Search by name"), {
  target: { value: "sentry" },
});

// ✅
import {render, screen, userEvent} from "sentry-test/reactTestingLibrary";
render(<Example />);
userEvent.type(screen.getByLabelText("Search by name"), "sentry");
```
