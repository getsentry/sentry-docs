title: "Environment"
---

This guide steps you through configuring a local development environment for the Sentry server on macOS. If you're using another operating system the instructions are still roughly the same, but we don't maintain any official documentation for anything else for now.

## Clone the Repository

To get started, clone the repo at [https://github.com/getsentry/sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry) - or, your fork.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/getsentry/sentry.git
cd sentry
```

You're going to be working out of this repository for the remainder of the setup.

## System Dependencies

You'll need to first install Xcode cli tools. (If you try running `git` or `make`, you'll get an xcrun error. Run `xcode-select --install` and follow the instructions.

Once you have Xcode installed, install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh), and then run `brew bundle` to install the various system packages as listed in sentry's `Brewfile`.

One thing that requires manual attention is `docker`, which should have just been installed. Open up Spotlight, search for "Docker" and start it. You should soon see the docker icon in your macOS menubar. Docker will automatically run on system restarts, so this should be the only time you do this.

You can verify that Docker is running by running `docker ps` in your terminal. If it doesn't error with something like `Error response from daemon: dial unix docker.raw.sock: connect: connection refused`, you're good to continue.

## Python

We utilize [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to install and manage python versions. It should have already been installed earlier when you ran `brew bundle`.

To install the required versions of Python you'll need to run `make setup-pyenv`. This will take a while, since your computer is actually compiling python!

After this, if you type `which python`, you should see something like `/usr/bin/python`... this means `python` will resolve to the system's python. You'll need to make some manual changes to your shell initialization files, if you want your shell to see pyenv's python.

If you're using bash, make sure your `~/.bash_profile` contains the following:

```bash {filename: ~/.bash_profile}
source ~/.bashrc
````

Configure your shell to load pyenv:

```bash {filename: ~/.bashrc}
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
```

```bash {filename: ~/.zshrc} {tabTitle: Zsh}
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
```


Once that's done, your shell needs to be reloaded. You can either reload it in-place, or close your terminal and start it again and cd into sentry. To reload it, run:

```bash
exec "$SHELL"
```

If it worked, running `which python` should result in something like `/Users/you/.pyenv/shims/python`.

### Virtual Environment

You're now ready to create a python virtual environment. Run:

```bash
python -m pip install virtualenv
python -m virtualenv .venv
```

And activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

If everything worked, running `which python` should now result in something like `/Users/you/sentry/.venv/bin/python`.

## JavaScript

We use [volta](https://github.com/volta-cli/volta) to install and manage the version of Node.js that Sentry requires. To install Volta run:

```bash
curl https://get.volta.sh | bash
```

The volta installer will tell you to "open a new terminal to start using Volta", but you don't have to! You can just reload your shell like before:

```bash
exec "$SHELL"
```


This works because the volta installer conveniently made changes to your shell installation files for your shell's startup script:

```bash {filename: ~/.bashrc}
eval "$(pyenv init -)"

export VOLTA_HOME="~/.volta"
grep --silent "$VOLTA_HOME/bin" <<< $PATH || export PATH="$VOLTA_HOME/bin:$PATH"
```

```bash {filename: ~/.zshrc} {tabTitle: Zsh}
eval "$(pyenv init -)"

export VOLTA_HOME="~/.volta"
grep --silent "$VOLTA_HOME/bin" <<< $PATH || export PATH="$VOLTA_HOME/bin:$PATH"
```

Now, if you try and run `volta`, you should see some help text, meaning volta is installed correctly. To install node, simply run:

```bash
node -v
```

Volta intercepts this and automatically downloads and installs the node version in sentry's `package.json`.

## Bootstrap Services

Source your virtual environment again (`source .venv/bin/activate`), then run `make bootstrap`. This will take a long time, as it bootstraps not only Sentry and its dependencies, but starts up related services, and runs database migrations.

The `bootstrap` command does a few things you'll want to know about:

- `sentry init` creates the baseline Sentry configuration in `~/.sentry/`.
- `sentry devservices up` spins up required Docker services (such as Postgres and Clickhouse)
- `sentry upgrade` runs Postgres migrations, and will also prompt you to create a user. You will want to ensure your first user is designated as **superuser**.

Once this command has finished you'll have Sentry installed in development mode with all its required dependencies.

## direnv

[direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv) _automatically activates your virtual environment_, sets some helpful environment variables for you, and performs some simple checks to make sure your environment is as expected (and tries its best to guide you if it isn't).

First, you should be done bootstrapping. Then, run `brew install direnv` and add the following snippet to the end of your startup script:

```bash {filename: ~/.bashrc}
eval "$(direnv hook bash)"
```

```bash {filename: ~/.zshrc} {tabTitle: Zsh}
eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"
```

And after doing that, reload your shell:

```bash
exec "$SHELL"
```

Any time the `.envrc` configuration changes (including the first time) you will be prompted to run `direnv allow` before any of the configuration will run. This is for security purposes and you are encouraged to inspect the changes before running this command.

## Running the Development Server

Once youâ€™ve successfully stood up your datastore, you can now run the development server:

```bash
sentry devserver --workers
```

If you are developing for aesthetics only and do not rely on the async workers, you can omit the `--workers` flag in order to use less system resources.

If you would like to be able to run `devserver` outside of your root checkout, you can install `webpack` globally with `npm install -g webpack`.

<Alert title="Note" level="info">
  When asked for the root address of the server, make sure that you use{" "}
  <a href="http://localhost:8000">http://localhost:8000</a>, as both, protocol{" "}
  <em>and</em> port are required in order for DNS and some pages urls to be
  displayed correctly.
</Alert>

## Setting up Getsentry

<Alert title="Corporate Users Only" level="warning">
  Only Sentry employees have access to getsentry.
</Alert>

Now that you have sentry all set up, it's time to set up Getsentry. For information on the distinction between the two, refer to <Link to="/sentry-vs-getsentry/">Sentry vs Getsentry</Link>. After setting it up, you'll also want to read about the development workflow <Link to="/workflow/">here</Link>.

Let's start off by cloning the `getsentry` repository to be adjacent with your
sentry repository:

```bash
# Go to where you have sentry and clone getsentry.
cd /path/to/sentry
cd ..
git clone git@github.com:getsentry/getsentry.git
```

It's necessary to keep getsentry in an adjacent directory (it's expected by
`install-py-dev` in the getsentry Makefile). For example, if you
did a `ls ~/code` you'd see something like:

```bash
sentry/   getsentry/
```

Next, <Link to="#virtual-environment">create a virtual environment</Link> just like how you did with Sentry earlier.

Then, run `make bootstrap` and follow any additional instructions that come up.

If all went well, then you can start the development server:

```bash
getsentry devserver --workers
```

Note that you **cannot** have both sentry and getsentry devserver running at the same time.

After the server warms up for a little while, you should be able to access it
at [http://dev.getsentry.net:8000](http://dev.getsentry.net:8000/).

You can set your local instance's org to use a business plan by running the
following in getsentry:

```go
./bin/mock-subscription <org_slug> --plan mm2_a_500k
```

---

**Problem:** something like `pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: The 'some_dependency<0.6.0,>=0.5.5' distribution was not found and is required by sentry`

**Solution:** Your virtualenv needs to be updated. run `make install-py-dev`.

---

**Problem:** You see `Error occured while trying to proxy to: dev.getsentry.net:8000/`

**Solution:**  You likely need to upgrade your Python dependencies. Go to the git root directory and run `make install-py-dev`.

---

**Problem:** `Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'integration-docs-platforms'`

**Solution:**

```bash
make build-platform-assets
```

---

**Problem:** `SessionNotCreatedException: Message: session not created: This version of ChromeDriver only supports Chrome version 76`

Also, another symptom indicating you need to upgrade chromedriver:

```shell
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/joshua.li/dev/sentry/sentry/src/sentry/utils/pytest/selenium.py", line 344, in browser
    driver = start_chrome(**chrome_args)
  File "/Users/joshua.li/dev/sentry/sentry/src/sentry/utils/retries.py", line 41, in execute_with_retry
    return retrier(functools.partial(fn, *args, **kwargs))
  File "/Users/joshua.li/dev/sentry/sentry/src/sentry/utils/retries.py", line 85, in __call__
    error,
RetryException: Could not successfully execute <functools.partial object at 0x10f31e7e0> within 15.830 seconds (12 attempts.)
```

**Solution:**

```bash
brew cask upgrade chromedriver
```

---

**Problem:**

```shell
--- snip ---
00:51:27 server  | ImportError: cannot import name _remove_dead_weakref
00:51:27 server  | unable to load app 0 (mountpoint='') (callable not found or import error)
```

This is caused by uwsgi running the wrong version of python. When starting up, you'll see something like

```shell
uwsgi socket 0 bound to TCP address 127.0.0.1:8889 fd 3
Python version: 2.7.10 (default, Feb 22 2019, 21:17:52)  [GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 10.0.1 (clang-1001.0.37.14)]
Set PythonHome to /Users/dfuller/code/sentry/.venv
```

The python version here should be 2.7.16, but will be a lower version, likely your system python. This is because uwsgi was compiled against a stale python and the resultant wheel has been cached by pip.

**Solution:**

In your sentry virtualenv:

```shell
pip uninstall uwsgi
pip install --no-cache-dir uwsgi
```
