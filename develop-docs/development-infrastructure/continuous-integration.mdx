## Deployments

[GoCD](https://deploy.getsentry.net) is used for deployments. Please refer to the [internal user guide](https://www.notion.so/sentry/GoCD-User-Guide-4f8456d2477c458095c4aa0e67fc38a6).

## GitHub Actions

GitHub actions is our primary CI system and runs our tests on every pull request and on merges to master. It is required that tests pass before changes can be merged.

## Docker images

We use GitHub Actions to build our Docker images. We primarily use [a composite action](https://github.com/getsentry/action-build-and-push-images) for building and pushing images to ensure that the workflows for building and publishing images are standardized, and appropriate metadata is available in the images. The standard for artifact management can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/sentry/Standard-Spec-Artifact-Management-22a8b10e4b5d80ecb6dcca3eb4558f5b).

We use GHCR (github container registry) for images that are used in CI, self-hosted, and local development. GAR (google artifact registry) is used for images that are used in prod.

## Fast-Revert
In order to facilitate quick changes to unblock failures on default branches, many of our repositories have a fast-revert workflow. In order to use it, PR's can be automatically reverted once a label `Trigger: Revert` is applied. More details found [here](https://www.notion.so/sentry/Standard-Spec-Fast-Revert-2388b10e4b5d8019bc98d863703d1b17?pvs=25)
