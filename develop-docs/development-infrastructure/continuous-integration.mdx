## GitHub Actions

We use Github Actions as our primary CI system. With it, we run many quality checks, including but not limited to testing, linting, and code coverage. We only run front end tests if there are front end changes, and vice versa for back end tests. These actions run in pull requests and also merges into `master`. Pull requests must successfully run all actions in order to be merged into `master`.

## Docker images

We primarily use [a composite GitHub action](https://github.com/getsentry/action-build-and-push-images) for building and pushing images. This ensures that the workflows for building and publishing images are standardized, and appropriate metadata is available in the images. The standard for artifact management can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/sentry/Standard-Spec-Artifact-Management-22a8b10e4b5d80ecb6dcca3eb4558f5b).

We use GHCR (github container registry) for images that are used in CI, self-hosted, and local development. GAR (google artifact registry) is used for images that are used in prod.

## Fast-Revert
In order to facilitate quick changes to unblock failures on default branches, many of our repositories have a fast-revert workflow. To revert a PR, apply the `Trigger: Revert` label. Information regarding prerequisites and which repositories have this functionality can be found in our [internal docs](https://www.notion.so/sentry/Standard-Spec-Fast-Revert-2388b10e4b5d8019bc98d863703d1b17?pvs=25)

## Deployments

At Sentry we use [GoCD](https://deploy.getsentry.net) for our deployments. Please refer to the [internal user guide](https://www.notion.so/sentry/GoCD-User-Guide-4f8456d2477c458095c4aa0e67fc38a6) for more information.
