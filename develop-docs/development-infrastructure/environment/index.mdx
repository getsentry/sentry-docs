description: This guide steps you through configuring a local development environment for the Sentry server on macOS and Linux.
sidebar_order: 2
---

If you're using
another operating system (Plan 9, BeOS, Windows, …) the instructions are still roughly the same, but we don't maintain any official documentation
for anything else for now.

## Setup

Begin by installing the `devenv` tool following [these instructions](https://github.com/getsentry/devenv#install).

After installation you should be able to run `devenv bootstrap` which will guide you through the rest.

When you're done with setup, you'll want to also review the <Link to="/development/workflow/">development workflow</Link>.

## Keeping your environment up-to-date

Simply run `devenv sync` inside of your sentry or getsentry repo.

NOTE: After running `devenv sync` you may need to restart your terminal to continue.

## Running the Development Server

The `devservices` ensure that you have all the services required for local development running. See the [devservices docs](/development/devservices/) for more information on managing services.
When setting up `sentry`, execute the following command in the `sentry` folder:

```shell
devservices up
```

After that, you can start the development server inside the `sentry` folder:

```shell
sentry devserver --workers
```

If you are developing for aesthetics only and do not rely on the async workers, you can omit the `--workers` flag in order
to use fewer system resources.

Access it at [http://dev.getsentry.net:8000](http://dev.getsentry.net:8000) (you'll have to wait a bit for webpack to finish).
A superuser account should have been created for you during bootstrap - `admin@sentry.io` with password `admin`.
You can create other users with `sentry createuser`.

<Alert title="Note">
  When asked for the root address of the server, make sure that you use
  [http://dev.getsentry.net:8000](http://dev.getsentry.net:8000), as both
  protocol _and_ port are required in order for DNS and some pages' URLs to be
  displayed correctly.
</Alert>

### Frontend Only & Backend Only

Please refer to [Frontend Development Server](/frontend/development-server/) and [Backend Development Server](/backend/development-server/) for alternative ways to bring up the Sentry UI.

### Enabling HTTPS

Optionally, you may wish to run the development server over HTTPS, for certain situations (like testing JS APIs that require a secure context).

First we will use [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) to create and install a locally-trusted, development certificate and [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) as our reverse proxy.

```shell
brew install mkcert
brew install nss # if you use Firefox
brew install caddy
yarn mkcert-localhost
```

Then we will run the reverse proxy as needed:
```shell
yarn https-proxy
```

After the server is running we can visit the dev server using `https` at port `:8003` instead of over `http` at `:8000`.

<Alert title="HTTP Strict-Transport-Security">
  You might get into a situation where [HSTS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) is enabled for your domain and you're unable to visit using `http` anymore.

  To clear the HSTS visit `chrome://net-internals/#hsts` in Chrome based browsers and use the "Delete domain security policies" form.
</Alert>

### Ingestion Pipeline (Relay) aka Sending Events to your Dev Environment

<Link to="/relay/">Relay</Link> and the ingest workers are not started by default. Follow the instructions below to start them so you can send events to your dev environment Sentry instance:

- Set `SENTRY_USE_RELAY = True` in `~/.sentry/sentry.conf.py`.
- Run `devservices up` to start the services Relay needs. (like for example Kafka)
- (Re-)Start your devserver with the `--ingest` flag (e.g. `sentry devserver --workers --ingest`). This will start the Relay container and all related services alongside your devserver.

## Running the Getsentry Development Server

<Alert title="Employees Only" level="warning">
  Only Sentry employees have access to getsentry.
</Alert>

See also: <Link to="/application/sentry-vs-getsentry/">Sentry vs Getsentry</Link>

Before running `getsentry`, you might need to run `devenv sync` inside the `getsentry` directory if you have previously run `sentry` locally, as there might be differences between the environments.

Just like running `sentry` (see above), you can start the `devservices` using the following command in the `getsentry` folder:

```shell
devservices up
```

After that, you can start the development server inside the `getsentry` folder:

```shell
getsentry devserver --workers
```

**Note**: You **cannot** have both sentry and getsentry devserver running at the same time.

After the server warms up, access it at [http://dev.getsentry.net:8000](http://dev.getsentry.net:8000/). Using localhost won't work. Note that the **http** protocol is used, not **https**. If you encounter a certificate error while accessing it locally, it might be because your browser has remembered that `dev.getsentry.net` previously used the https protocol (possibly while running `yarn dev-ui`) and is now redirecting all http requests to https. To resolve this, open the site in an **incognito window** of your browser.

If you need to overwrite configuration options for your local
environment, you can create `getsentry/conf/settings/devlocal.py` and put the
configuration option overrides there. This module will be automatically imported
by `dev.py` if it exists.

To enable the ingest workers, follow the steps described <Link to="#ingestion-pipeline-relay">here</Link> and run

```shell
getsentry devserver --workers --ingest
```

## Running siloed instances

By default `sentry devserver` will run a monolith mode application server. You can also run `devserver` with siloed application instances. Before you do, you need to <Link to="/backend/database-migrations/#cloning-a-monolith-database">create split silo databases</Link>.

The devserver command supports `--silo` option that lets you create siloed instances. Any workers, consumers, or celery-beat processes will be started with the same silo mode.

```shell
# Start control silo servers
sentry devserver --silo=control --celery-beat --workers

# Start region silo servers
sentry devserver --silo=region --celery-beat --workers --ingest
```

Siloed servers have the following port assignments:

- 8000 - Webpack
- 8010 - Region silo webserver
- 8001 - Control silo webserver

In the above setup your local environment will use org slug domains, and send requests to `us.dev.getsentry.net` (region silo) and `dev.getsentry.net` (control silo). All requests will be proxied by webpack and forwarded to the appropriate server based on hostname.

### Ngrok and siloed servers

Refer to <Link to="/development/ngrok/">ngrok docs</Link>.

### Siloed Django Shell

If you want to use a repl with silo modes active:

```shell
# Start a control silo shell
SENTRY_SILO_DEVSERVER=1 SENTRY_SILO_MODE=CONTROL getsentry django shell

# Start a region silo shell
SENTRY_SILO_DEVSERVER=1 SENTRY_SILO_MODE=REGION SENTRY_REGION=us getsentry django shell
```

**Problem:** `DoesNotExist: Subscription matching query does not exist` during getsentry devserver

**Solution:**

```shell
./bin/mock-subscription
```

You can also set your local instance's org to use a business plan by running the
following in getsentry:

```shell
./bin/mock-subscription <org_slug> --plan mm2_a_500k
```

---

**Problem:** `Error response from daemon: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint sentry-postgres-1 (e9e631ff7f32bd00052c25064c56609794a3b96da0dc04742f558e3ae659fa66): Bind for 127.0.0.1:5432 failed: port is already allocated`

**Solution:**

There is another process using the port. Try running `docker ps`. If you are currently running services through `sentry devservices`, you will need to stop them.

```shell
sentry devservices down
devservices up
```
Otherwise, check to see if you have another process running on the allocated port.
```shell
lsof -i :5432
```
Then, either end the process or kill it if you need to.

---

**Problem:** You see an error that mentions something like `pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: The 'some_dependency<0.6.0,>=0.5.5' distribution was not found and is required by sentry`

**Solution:** Your virtualenv needs to be updated. Run `devenv sync`.

---

**Problem:** You see `Error occured while trying to proxy to: dev.getsentry.net:8000/`

**Solution:** You likely need to upgrade your Python dependencies. Go to the git root directory and run `make install-py-dev`.

---

**Problem:** `Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'integration-docs-platforms'`

**Solution:**

```shell
make build-platform-assets
```

---

**Problem:** You see `SessionNotCreatedException: Message: session not created: This version of ChromeDriver only supports Chrome version 76`

Or:

```shell
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/joshua.li/dev/sentry/sentry/src/sentry/utils/pytest/selenium.py", line 344, in browser
    driver = start_chrome(**chrome_args)
  File "/Users/joshua.li/dev/sentry/sentry/src/sentry/utils/retries.py", line 41, in execute_with_retry
    return retrier(functools.partial(fn, *args, **kwargs))
  File "/Users/joshua.li/dev/sentry/sentry/src/sentry/utils/retries.py", line 85, in __call__
    error,
RetryException: Could not successfully execute <functools.partial object at 0x10f31e7e0> within 15.830 seconds (12 attempts.)
```

**Solution:**

ChromeDriver needs to be updated.

```shell
brew upgrade --cask chromedriver
```

---

**Problem:** You see `DoesNotExist: Subscription matching query does not exist`

**Solution:** In getsentry, run the following to mock a subscription:

```shell
./bin/mock-subscription <org_slug>
```

---

**Problem:** You see something like `Error: No such container: sentry-postgres-1`, or you don't see `snuba-snuba-1`, `redis-redis-1`, `snuba-clickhouse-1`, and `kafka-kafka-1` listed under `COMMAND NAMES`.

**Solution:**

```shell
devservices up
```

---

**Problem:** You see something like `Error 61 connecting to 127.0.0.1:6379. Connection refused.` when running your dev server.

**Solution:** Make sure your Docker services are running:

```shell
docker ps
```

---

**Problem:** You use an Android emulator with a DSN pointing to localhost, and the events don't show up in your local Sentry instance.

**Solution:** Change `localhost` to `10.0.2.2`. So, for example, change http://d895df97e1cb4a33b4dff8af3e78da09@localhost:8000/2 to http://d895df97e1cb4a33b4dff8af3e78da09@10.0.2.2:8000/2. This is because localhost or `127.0.0.1` refers to the emulator's own loopback interface, not the loopback interface of the host machine. For more information see https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-networking.

---

**Problem:** Switching from Docker Desktop to Colima results in error `Failed to start service: Credentials store error: StoreError('docker-credential-desktop not installed or not available in PATH')`

**Solution:** Remove the `credsStore` key in your `~/.docker/config.json` file.
