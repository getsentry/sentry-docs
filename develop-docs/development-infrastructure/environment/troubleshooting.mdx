## Resetting the Database

If you're experiencing persistent database issues (migrations failing, schema corruption, or incompatible migrations between branches), you can completely reset your local database using `make reset-db`. **Warning:** This will delete all local data in your database.

```bash
make reset-db
```

This command will:
- Drop the existing database
- Create a new database
- Run all migrations
- Load initial data/fixtures
