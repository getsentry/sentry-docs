A standalone CLI tool called [`devservices`](https://github.com/getsentry/devservices) is used to bring up and manage service dependencies. The tool reads from a `config.yml` file within a repository's `devservices` directory. It is an abstraction built on top of Docker Compose and Docker.

```shell
usage: devservices [-h] [--version] COMMAND ...

CLI tool for managing service dependencies.

options:
  -h, --help          show this help message and exit
  --version           show program's version number and exit

commands:
  up                  Bring up a service and its dependencies
  down                Bring down a service and its dependencies
  list-dependencies   List the dependencies of a service
  list-services (ls)  List the services installed locally
  status              View status of a service
  logs                View logs for a service
  update              Update devservices to the latest version
  purge               Purge the local devservices cache
  toggle              Toggle how a service is run
  foreground          Foreground a background process for debugging
  serve               Start the devserver
```

## Installation

Installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/getsentry/devservices?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

## Viewing logs for a service

```shell
devservices logs
```

## Running CLI clients for redis, postgres and clickhouse

```shell
# redis
docker exec -it redis-redis-1 redis-cli

# clickhouse
docker exec -it snuba-clickhouse-1 clickhouse-client

# psql
docker exec -it sentry-postgres-1 psql -U postgres
```

## Removing container state

Should you really bamboozle your containers or volumes, you can use `devservices purge` to start over.

```shell
# Remove all data (containers, volumes, and networks) associated with ALL services
devservices purge
```

As an example, let's say we've managed to corrupt our postgres
database while working on a migration, and you want to reset
your postgres data you can do:

```shell
# Remove all data (containers, volumes, and networks) associated with a single service
docker container rm sentry-postgres-1
docker volume rm sentry_postgres-data
```

## Running devservices with a specific mode

Common modes in sentry:

- `default`: Bring up sentry dependencies and relay
- `migrations`: Bring up postgres and redis
- `minimal`: Bring up minimal services for local development
- `full`: Bring up all services (symbolicator, taskbroker, snuba, vroom, etc)
- `taskbroker`: Bring up sentry dependencies, taskbroker, taskworker, and taskworker-scheduler
- `memcached`: Bring up sentry dependencies and memcached

Modes for specific development scenarios:
- `chartcuterie`: Bring up sentry dependencies and chartcuterie
- `crons`: Brings up sentry dependencies and monitor consumers
- `launchpad`: Bring up sentry dependencies and launchpad
- `objectstore`: Bring up sentry dependencies and objectstore
- `profiling`: Bring up sentry dependencies, vroom, and profiling consumers
- `replay`: Bring up sentry dependencies and replay
- `symbolicator`: Bring up sentry dependencies and symbolicator
- `tracing`: Brings up sentry dependencies and everything necessary for transactions, spans, and metrics

Ingest Specific:
- `ingest`: Brings up the most common sentry dependencies to support ingestion of errors, transactions and attachments
- `ingest-all`: Brings up sentry dependencies to support ingesting everything

CI Specific:
- `acceptance-ci`: Bring up sentry dependencies and everything necessary for acceptance CI
- `backend-ci`: Bring up sentry dependencies and everything necessary for backend CI



```shell
devservices up --mode symbolicator
```

## Debugging a Background Process Interactively

There are a couple groups of processes that are running in the background. These include ingest consumers, post process forwarders, and taskworkers. You'll want to use the devservices foreground command to debug these interactively if you cannot do so with the devserver itself.

1. Bring up your development environment:
``` sh
devservices up --mode taskbroker
devservices serve
```

2. Add a breakpoint

``` python
def example () -> None
  ...
  breakpoint() // After python 3.7
  import pdb; pdb.set_trace() // Before python 3.7
  ...
```

3. Bring a process to the foreground for debugging
``` sh
devservices foreground taskworker
```



## Running a dependency locally

You can run a dependency locally instead of as a container by toggling its runtime via the `devservices toggle` command.

### Toggle to local runtime

For example, if you're running Sentry and want to run Snuba **locally** from source, you can toggle Snuba to the local runtime like this:

```shell
devservices toggle snuba
```

or you can specify the runtime explicitly:

```shell
devservices toggle snuba local
```

This tells devservices to treat Snuba as a service that should be started alongside dependent services like Sentry. Dependencies of Snuba, such as Redis, Kafka, and Clickhouse, will still run as containers.

<Alert title="Note">
  Toggling to `local` does not start the dev server for that service. You'll need to start that manually.
</Alert>

### What happens when you toggle

If Sentry is already running, toggling Snuba to `local` will:
1. Stop Snuba's containers (unless shared by another service)
2. Start Snuba's non-local dependencies (Redis, Kafka, Clickhouse) as containers

If Sentry is not yet running, the next time `devservices up` is run, Snuba (and any other services you toggle to `local`) will be automatically started as local services alongside Sentry.

If you want to bring up Snuba, or other local runtime dependencies in a non-default mode, you can:
1. Tell devservices to not bring them up automatically by passing the `--exclude-local` flag to `devservices up`.
2. Bring that mode up manually via `devservices up --mode <mode>` since modes are additive.
3. Bring that service down and back up again with the new mode.

### Bringing down services with local runtimes

When stopping services with `devservices down`, the default behavior is to stop all services and their dependencies, including dependencies with local runtimes.

If you don't want dependencies with local runtimes to be brought down when bringing down a dependent service, you can pass the `--exclude-local` flag to `devservices down`. This tells devservices to only stop dependencies that are not running with local runtimes.

### Toggle back to containerized runtime

To switch a service back to running in a container, you can do the following:

```shell
devservices toggle snuba
```

Or explicitly specify the runtime:

```shell
devservices toggle snuba CONTAINERIZED
```

Replace `snuba` with the name of the service you want to toggle.

## Migrating data from the deprecated `sentry devservices`

<Alert level="warning" title="Important">
  These instructions can result in data loss. Please proceed with caution. This is an example with postgres, but can be done with other docker volumes as well.
</Alert>

Volume names are different for each service.

Clickhouse:
  - old: `sentry_clickhouse`
  - new: `snuba_clickhouse-data`

Postgres:
  - old: `sentry_postgres`
  - new: `sentry_postgres-data`

Kafka:
  - old: `sentry_kafka`
  - new: `kafka_kafka-data`

Redis:
  - old: `sentry_redis`
  - new: `redis_redis-data`

```shell
# Create a new postgres volume
docker volume create sentry_postgres-data

# Copy over the data from the old volume
docker run --rm \
  -v sentry_postgres:/old_volume \
  -v sentry_postgres-data:/new_volume \
  ubuntu \
  bash -c "cd /old_volume && cp -a . /new_volume"

# Validate that data has been copied over
docker run --rm -v sentry_postgres-data:/data ubuntu ls -l /data
```
