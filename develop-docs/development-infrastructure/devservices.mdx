A standalone CLI tool called [`devservices`](https://github.com/getsentry/devservices) is used to bring up and manage service dependencies. The tool reads from a `config.yml` file within a repository's `devservices` directory. It is an abstraction built on top of Docker Compose and Docker.

```shell
usage: devservices [-h] [--version] COMMAND ...

CLI tool for managing service dependencies.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --version             show program's version number and exit

commands:
  up                  Bring up a service and its dependencies
  down                Bring down a service and its dependencies
  list-dependencies   List the dependencies of a service
  list-services (ls)  List the services installed locally
  status              View status of a service
  logs                View logs for a service
  update              update devservices to the latest version
  purge               Purge the local devservices cache
```

## Viewing logs for a service

```shell
devservices logs
```

## Running CLI clients for redis, postgres and clickhouse

```shell
# redis
docker exec -it redis-redis-1 redis-cli

# clickhouse
docker exec -it snuba-clickhouse-1 clickhouse-client

# psql
docker exec -it sentry-postgres-1 psql -U postgres
```

## Removing container state

Should you really bamboozle your containers or volumes, you can use `devservices purge` to start over.

```shell
# Remove all data (containers, volumes, and networks) associated with ALL services
devservices purge
```

As an example, let's say we've managed to corrupt our postgres
database while working on a migration, and you want to reset
your postgres data you can do:

```shell
# Remove all data (containers, volumes, and networks) associated with a single service
docker container rm sentry-postgres-1
docker volume rm sentry_postgres-data
```
