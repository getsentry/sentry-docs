This documentation serves as reference points for developing against Sentry.

Before getting started, there's a few key concepts you should understand.

## `sentry` vs `getsentry`

You'll find numerous references to both `sentry`, the public repository and core of Sentry, and `getsentry`, the proprietary and closed source components used for sentry.io.

In most cases, the systems operate very similarly with subtle differences. That is, you can often swap the `sentry` CLI for the `getsentry` CLI and they'll behave the same. In other cases we have attempted to call out differences in behavior.

If you're not part of the Sentry team, you won't have access to develop on the `getsentry` codebase and you can ignore the related documentation.

## Getting Started

We recommend going through the general documentation before contributing a change to Sentry

- <Link to="/environment/">Development Environment</Link>
- <Link to="/python-dependencies/">Python Dependencies</Link>
- <Link to="/translations/">Translations</Link>

You can also take a glance at the [Sentry Dockerfile](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/blob/master/docker/Dockerfile) for more information on how the Sentry server is configured including its system dependencies.
