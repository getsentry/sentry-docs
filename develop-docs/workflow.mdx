## Testing Sentry commits in Getsentry

**If you need to deploy to a staging environment**: use
`./bin/bump-sentry <sha>` to update the committed version.  Note that this will
likely create a merge conflict so you'll want to merge just before updating:

```bash
git pull origin HEAD --rebase
./bin/bump-sentry deadbeef
git push origin HEAD -f
```

**If you only need to validate CI**: When you create a PR add `requires <PR link>`
to the body of it. The `getsentry/action-get-dependent-pr` github action will
pick up this value and update the sentry revision during CI.  This is meant as
a temporary measure to quickly validate a change -- one should commit backward
and forward compatible changes in `sentry` since commits cannot be merged in
lockstep.

NOTE: If you notice after opening it, edit the PR body and then push a new commit.

## Fast reverting a change

If a merged PR in `sentry` or `getsentry` needs to be reverted immediately
(such as during an incident or to un-break CI) the **`[Trigger: Revert]`**
label can be applied to the PR.  A GitHub action will process the label and
apply the revert directly to the primary branch.

## Python typechecking

We're slowly working to add typing to our Python codebase, using `mypy` to check types. While we do that, there are a few useful things to know:

- As you create or work on Python files, please add typing where you can. If possible, try to follow the [Python typing best practices](https://typing.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/best_practices.html), which may mean you also have to add `from __future__ import annotations` as the first line of your file. For more information about using types in Python, see [the typing docs](https://typing.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

- Check that the file you're modifying is not on the exclude list from `pyproject.toml`. In other words, you need to opt-in the file for type checking to happen.

- To test types locally, you can run `mypy path/to/file` or just `mypy` to run against all files.
