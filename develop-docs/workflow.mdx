## Testing Sentry commits in Getsentry

Sometimes, it's prudent to also run Getsentry tests against commits in Sentry.
The most common scenarios here are that you're either working on a particularly
large or scary-looking Sentry PR, or upgrading a Python dependency.

This is manually achieved by running `bin/bump-sentry <sha>` in a Getsentry PR,
but it could be a chore to keep this up as you continually push commits to the
Sentry PR you need synced. In this case, we have the <Link to="https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-deploy-sync-hook">sentry-deploy-sync-hook</Link>.

For it to work, you must first add `#sync-getsentry` to the Sentry PR's description,
and then create a Getsentry PR where the branch is the same name.

## Fast reverting a change

If a merged PR in `sentry` or `getsentry` needs to be reverted immediately
(such as during an incident or to un-break CI) the **`[Trigger: Revert]`**
label can be applied to the PR.  A GitHub action will process the label and
apply the revert directly to the primary branch.
