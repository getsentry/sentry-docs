title: Flagpole
---

Flagpole is Sentry's internal, options-backed feature flagging library.

Features are defined in the [`sentry-options-automator`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-options-automator) repository as yaml objects within the [`options/defaults/flagpole.yml`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-options-automator/blob/main/options/default/flagpole.yml) file.
These yaml options are pushed to each of our deployments and stored in a database table, where they are later queried and parsed during feature flag evaluation.

Here's the example configuration for a feature named `organizations:is_sentry`, which is enabled for an organization with the slug `sentry`.
```yaml
options:
  'feature.organizations:is_sentry':
    created_at: '2024-06-01T00:00:00.000000'
    enabled: false
    owner: hybrid-cloud
    segments:
    - conditions:
      - operator: in
        value:
          - sentry
        property: organization_slug
      name: is_sentry
      rollout: 100
```

## Flagpole Feature Yaml Structure

`created_at`

: The ISO 8601 datetime of when the feature was added to the config yaml.

`owner`

: The team name or email of the user that owns this feature flag

`enabled` [optional]

: The global toggle for the feature flag. Defaults to `True`. Setting this to `False` can be a break-glass safety valve to disable a feature without having to modify existing segments or conditions.

`segments`

: A wrapper around a list of conditions, acting as a logical grouping of customers/entities to enable the feature flag for.  Segments allow you to create `OR` operations with other segments, meaning at least one segment must evaluate to `True` for a feature to be granted. If an empty segments list is provided, the feature will evaluate to `False`.

### Segments
`conditions`

: A list of predicates to evaluate for the feature flag to be enabled for this segment. All conditions in a segment must be evaluate to `True` in order for the segment to be enabled. If no conditions are defined, the segment will evaluate to `False`.

`name`

: A brief description of the segment identifying its intended purpose.

`rollout` [optional]

: A percentage of entities to enable the feature for, defined as an integer between `0` - `100`. Defaults to `100`.


### Conditions
`property`

: The property name of the evaluation context entry to match against.

`value`

: The expected value to compare against the evaluation context's property value, using the provided operator.

`operator`

: The comparison strategy to apply between the evaluation context's property value and the provided condition value.


### Operators
Flagpole currently supports the following `operator` types:

`in`

: Given a list of values, evaluates to `True` if the context property value exists in the list.

`not_in`

: The inverse of `in`, evaluates to `True` if the context property value does not exist in the provided list.

`contains`

: Given a single int, string, float, or boolean value, evalutes to `True` if the context property value is a list containing the provided value.

`not_contains`

: The inverse of `contains`, evalutes to `True` if the context property value is a list which does not contain the provided value.

`equals`

: Given a single int, string, float, or boolean value, evaluates to `True` if the context property value exactly matches the provided value.

`not_equals`

: The inverse of `equals`, evaluates to `True` if the context property value does not match the provided value.

## Evaluation Contexts
When a feature flag is checked, the caller must provide one or more entity objects for the feature handler to match against.  These objects are used to construct an `EvaluationContext`, which is essentially a flat dictionary of keys and primitive values. This context is passed to each feature, which provides this context to each segment and condition to enforce whether the feature should be enabled.

### Context Builders
Each evaluation context is built up in stages via a [`ContextBuilder`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/blob/3cbf73a389a4ea006cbad9d8c4b8073effe09393/src/flagpole/evaluation_context.py#L54) object.

Each context builder consists of a list of context transformers, which are responsible for creating individual slices of the larger evaluation context.

Here are some common properties we surface via our Sentry and GetSentry context builders that you can use in your conditions:

**System Context Properties**

`sentry_region` [str]

: The sentry region or single-tenant the flag check is being perfomed in.

**Organization Context Properties**

`organization_id` [int]

: The organization's ID

`organization_slug` [str]

: The organization's slug

`organization_name` [str]

: The organization's name

`organization_is-early-adopter` [bool]

: Whether or not the organization has the `early_adopter` flag enabled

**Project Context Properties (If checking a project feature)**

`project_id` [int]

: The project's ID

`project_slug` [str]

: The project's slug

**User Context Properties (If checking a flag with an actor)**

`user_id` [int]

: The active user's ID

`user_email` [str]

: The active user's email address. This should only contain Sentry employee email addresses.

## Rolling out a new Flagpole feature

Creating a new Flagpole Feature is currently a 3 step process:
1. Register a new feature in Sentry's `temporary.py` file or GetSentry's `features.py` file with the Flagpole strategy:
```python
features.add(
    "<feature_scope>:<feature_name>",
    OrganizationFeature,
    FeatureHandlerStrategy.FLAGPOLE
)
```

2. Add a new feature object entry to sentry-options-automator's `flagpole.yml` file. The feature's option name must follow the following format in order to be picked up by Flagpole:

```
feature.<feature_scope>:<feature_name>
```

3. Add the feature name to the `flagpole.flagpole_only_features` list in sentry-options-automator's default [`app.yaml`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-options-automator/blob/483737d45dbc68253e926c3f860b5ae33111697b/options/default/app.yaml#L219) file, omitting the `feature.` prefix.

Once the option change is deployed, the feature checks will immediately be active in all environments and regions.

_Note:_ The feature config should not be merged until the registration commit in step 1 has been fully deployed to all target environments. This is because Options Automator will fail to push options to any environments missing the option registration.

If this happens, make sure to rerun the options deployment once all environments have been updated to ensure your feature is active.

## Testing a Flagpole feature locally
You can test a flagpole feature flag locally using the GetSentry devserver.
Because the feature handler for Flagpole only exists in GetSentry, it's not possible
to test flagpole features using the Sentry devserver at this time.

Start by creating a new yaml file containing your feature config. The config
file should contain a top-level `options` object containing your feature object,
and a `flagpole.flagpole_only_features` list option containing the name of the
feature you want to test, without the `feature.` prefix:
```yaml
options:
  flagpole.flagpole_only_features: ['organizations:is_sentry']

  'feature.organizations:is_sentry':
    created_at: '2024-06-01T00:00:00.000000'
    enabled: false
    owner: hybrid-cloud
    segments:
    - conditions:
      - operator: in
        value:
          - sentry
        property: organization_slug
      name: is_sentry
      rollout: 100
```

_Note:_ The `flagpole_only_features` option will only be required while
Flagpole is actively being rolled out.


You can push your feature option to your local devserver using the following `getsentry` CLI command:

```bash
getsentry configoptions -f <path>/<to>/<your>/<config>.yml -l DEBUG patch
```

If this command runs successfully, your flagpole feature should now be
active in your local devserver instance and will persist across runs until
you remove the feature option.

To unset your feature, comment out or remove your feature config from the
`option` object, and rerun the `getsentry configoptions` command above.
