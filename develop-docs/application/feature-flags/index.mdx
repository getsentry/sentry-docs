title: 'Feature Flags'
---

Feature flags are declared in Sentry's codebase (look for `SENTRY_FEATURES` in
[`server.py`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/blob/master/src/sentry/conf/server.py)).
For self-hosted users, those flags are then configured via `sentry.conf.py`.
For Sentry's SaaS deployment, options automator is used to configure flags in production.

You can find a list of features available by looking at two files:

 - `sentry/features/permanent.py` - Features typically managed by subscriptions for sentry.io
 - `sentry/features/temporary.py` - Features used during development intended to be removed

They're declared on the `FeatureManager` like so:

```python
# pass FeatureHandlerStrategy.FLAGPOLE to use our options-backed feature flagging system:
manager.add("organizations:onboarding", OrganizationFeature, FeatureHandlerStrategy.FLAGPOLE)
# pass FeatureHandlerStrategy.INTERNAL if you don't plan to use options automator:
manager.add("organizations:onboarding", OrganizationFeature, FeatureHandlerStrategy.INTERNAL)
# [DEPRECATED] pass FeatureHandlerStrategy.OPTIONS to use options automator:
manager.add("organizations:onboarding", OrganizationFeature, FeatureHandlerStrategy.OPTIONS)
```

The feature can be enabled with the following in your `sentry.conf.py`, usually located at `~/.sentry/`:

```python
SENTRY_FEATURES["organizations:onboarding"] = True
```

You can modify the state of [feature flags in tests](/development/testing/#setting-options-and-feature-flags) using a context manager.

Generally you want your feature names to be unique to help in their
[removal](#after-launch-graduation).  For example a feature flag like `trends`
may prove difficult to find because `trends` may appear throughout the codebase.
But a name like `performance-trends-view` is more likely to be unique and easier
to remove later

## Creating a new Feature Flag

### Determine what scope the feature should have

Features can be scoped by organization, and projects. If you're not confident
you want a project feature, create an organization level one. In this example
we'll build a feature called `test-feature` scoped at the _organization_ level.

### Determine the permanency of your feature

Typically we use feature flags for development. They are usually [intended to
be graduated](#after-launch-graduation). The only exceptions to this are permanent
flags which control [subscription plan-specific features](#plan-specific-features)
in GetSentry.

Most Sentry feature flags are placed in `temporary.py`, while permanent Sentry flags live in
`permanent.py`.

GetSentry only flags are typically placed in [`features.py`](https://github.com/getsentry/getsentry/blob/master/getsentry/features.py).

### Add your feature to the FeatureManager

If you want to back your feature flag via options, you can do so using the [Flagpole](/feature-flags/flagpole/) library
by adding the feature to the `FeatureManager` with the `FLAGPOLE` enum set as the feature strategy:

```python
default_manager.add('organizations:test-feature', OrganizationFeature, FeatureHandlerStrategy.FLAGPOLE)
```

_Note:_ It used to be required to add a new feature's name to `server.py` in Sentry in order to set a default value, but this
is no longer required. Instead, the `manager.add()` method takes a default value, or automatically sets the value
to `False` if no default is provided.

```python
# Example of a feature set with a default value of True
default_manager.add('organizations:test-feature', OrganizationFeature, FeatureHandlerStrategy.FLAGPOLE, default=True)
```

If you don't plan to use Flagpole, use `FeatureHandlerStrategy.INTERNAL` with a custom feature handler instead, for example:

```python
default_manager.add('organizations:test-feature', OrganizationFeature, FeatureHandlerStrategy.INTERNAL)
```

### Add it to the Organization Model Serializer

The Organization model serializer
(`src/sentry/api/serializers/models/organization.py`) builds a list
called `feature_list` that is given to the front-end to use. By default, all
organization features are checked and those that are present are added into the list. If
your feature requires additional custom logic, you will have to update the
organization serializer to check and include it manually.

### Using Model Flags (Less common)

Sometimes a flag on the model is used to indicate a feature flag as shown
below. This is not recommended unless there is a specific reason to make
changes to the model. For example, the `require_2fa` flag affects behavior on
the backend to enforce two-factor authentication.

```python
feature_list = []

if getattr(obj.flags, 'allow_joinleave'):
    feature_list.append('open-membership')
if not getattr(obj.flags, 'disable_shared_issues'):
    feature_list.append('shared-issues')
if getattr(obj.flags, 'require_2fa'):
    feature_list.append('require-2fa')
```

## Checking your feature

### In Python code

The FeatureManager's `has` method checks see if the feature exists. The `has`
method takes in the feature's name, the objects that correspond to the scope of
the feature *(i.e. an organization for an organization level feature or
a project for a project level feature)*, and the actor (aka user). Here's an example
Organization feature check:

```python
if features.has('organizations:test-feature', obj, actor=user):
    feature_list.append('test-feature')
```

The example code only adds the feature to the `feature_list` if that feature is enabled for
the organization and the type of user given. Note that when we give the feature
to the frontend, we remove the scope prefix, and
our `'organizations:test-feature'` becomes `'test-feature'`.

### In JavaScript

There is a difference between using the flag in Sentry and in GetSentry. At this
stage you're not quite ready to use your feature flag in GetSentry, but you are
able to use it inside Sentry.

### Declarative features with the Feature component

React uses a declarative programming paradigm. As such, we have a utility
component that we use to hide components based on the feature flags available to
a organization/project

```jsx
import Feature from 'sentry/components/acl/feature';

const toRender = (
  <Feature features={['test-feature']}>
    <MyComponentToFlag />
  </Feature>
);
```

### Imperative feature flag checks

There are some exceptions when React components are generated imperatively (e.g.
headers/columns for Tables). In difficult times like these, the `Organization`
/ `Project` object has a array of the feature flags, which you can use in this
way:

```jsx
const {organization} = this.props;

// Method 2
organization.features.includes('test-feature'); // evals to True/False
```

## Enabling features in development

In Sentry you can run `sentry devserver` to view your changes in development
mode. If you would like to view a change behind a feature flag, you will need to
open the file `~/.sentry/sentry.conf.py` on your local machine. This file
contains your local settings for the sentry application, and can be viewed and
edited. If you would like to toggle a flag on or off, add this to your
configuration file:

```python
SENTRY_FEATURES['organizations:test-feature'] = True
```


Alternatively, you can test Flagpole features by setting custom options locally.
See the [Flagpole Local Development](/feature-flags/flagpole/#testing-a-flagpole-feature-locally) docs for more information on this.

## Enabling your feature in production

Feature flags are declared in Sentry's codebase. For self-hosted users, those
flags are then configured via `sentry.conf.py`. For Sentry's SaaS deployment,
you have the choice of using an option backed rollout via Options Automator with Flagpole,
or by writing a custom feature flag handler.

- [Flagpole](/feature-flags/flagpole/) is Sentry's internal feature flagging library, allowing a feature
with multiple target segments and condition filters to be defined in YAML within Options Automator.

- [Options based features](/feature-flags/options-backed-features/) [DEPRECATED] allow a feature
to be rolled out to a specific subset of LA orgs, a percentage of EA orgs,
and/or a percentage of all orgs. These can be used in high scale situations, and are generally
preferred over customer feature handlers. This strategy predates Flagpole, which is the new standard
way to define an option-backed feature flag.

## After launch (Graduation)

After your feature has been mainlined and is available for all customers on
sentry.io, you have a few potential paths:

- If the feature cannot be disabled, or you don't need to conditionally disable
  the feature, remove the feature flag and all related checks from the Sentry
  code base. If necessary, also remove references to the feature from the
  [self-hosted](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted), getsentry, and
  options-automator repositories.
- If the feature will only be available to SaaS customers on specific plans, you
  need to add your feature flag to the appropriate plans and update feature
  handlers (see below).You should also enable the feature by default in
  [`conf/server.py`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/blob/master/src/sentry/conf/server.py)
  in sentry to ensure that the feature is available for self-hosted deployments.

## Getsentry feature handlers

Getsentry contains a variety of feature handlers that override the
`SENTRY_FEATURES` map, which are defined in the [`features.py`](https://github.com/getsentry/getsentry/blob/master/getsentry/features.py) file.

### Plan specific features

If your feature is available for a subset of plans (eg. only on Business plans)
you need to:

1. Disable the feature in `getsentry/conf/settings/defaults.py` by updating `SENTRY_FEATURES`.
2. Add your feature to the appropriate plan feature list.
3. Update `SubscriptionPlanFeatureHandler` to handle your feature.

### Custom handlers

If your feature requires additional logic to become active, you can also
implement a feature handler in getsentry. For example, you can create a feature flag that is backed by [options](/options/). follow these steps:

1. Disable the feature in `getsentry/conf/settings/defaults.py` by updating `SENTRY_FEATURES`.
2. Add a new feature handler class in `getsentry/features.py` that determines availability of the feature based on the organization or actor.
3. Register the handler at the bottom of `getsentry/features.py`.
