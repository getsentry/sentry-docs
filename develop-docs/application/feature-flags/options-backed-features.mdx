title: Options Backed Features [DEPRECATED]
---

Options backed features using the `OPTIONS` strategy enum were a temporary stopgap
that was used to formalize options-backed feature flags. These have since been
replaced by [Flagpole](/feature-flags/flagpole/), which is Sentry's preferred
means of setting feature flags now.


## Building your options based feature
Declare your feature in sentry/features/temporary.py or
sentry/features/permanent.py like so:
```python
manager.add("organizations:your-new-flag", OrganizationFeature, FeatureHandlerStrategy.OPTIONS)
```

This automatically registers a feature handler for you in getsentry, and also
auto registers the relevant options.

To roll out your feature, you'll want to set the rollout options via options
automator. To figure out the options you need to configure, you can run the
following script in getsentry:
```python
./bin/generate_automator_feature_options.py --flag organizations:your-new-flag
```

It will then produce output like

```python
Generating automator options for feature flag `organizations:your-new-flag`
Add these to the appropriate file in options automator to roll out your feature
For example, to roll out in the US, you can add them to https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-options-automator/blob/main/options/regions/us/app.yaml
To roll out to all production regions, you can add them to https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-options-automator/blob/main/options/default/app.yaml
Options:
  organizations.your-new-flag.la-rollout: 0.0
  organizations.your-new-flag.ea-rollout: 0.0
  organizations.your-new-flag.ga-rollout: 0.0
  organizations.your-new-flag.la-orgs: [
    "codecov",
    "sentry",
    "sentry-sdks",
    "sentry-test",
    "sentry-st",
    "sentry-emerging-tech",
    "specto-dev",
  ]
```

Open a pr in https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-options-automator to set
these options and you can roll out your feature flag. You can also customize
which orgs will be in your la rollout by modifying `la-orgs`
