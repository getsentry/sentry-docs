title: The `*_indexed` outcome category

Data types which are subject to dynamic sampling are represented in two different outcome data categories: "total" and "indexed". You can think of the "total" category as counting items that are stored in _aggregated_ form, i.e. as metrics. The "indexed" category counts items that are stored individually.

If an item is dropped _before_ metrics extraction & dynamic sampling, it will show up in both categories (for example, `"transaction"`  and `"transaction_indexed"`). If an item is dropped _by_ dynamic sampling, it will cease to exist in the "indexed" category, but will live on in the form of metrics.
