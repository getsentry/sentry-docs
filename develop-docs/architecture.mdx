## High level overview

Edges represent service dependencies.

```mermaid
graph TD
app[Your Application] --> |SDK| lb{{Load Balancer}}
lb --> |"sentry.example.com/api/\d+/store/"| relay
lb --> |"sentry.example.com"| sentry_web["Sentry (web)"]
symbolicator --> sentry_web
relay --> kafka
relay --> redis
sentry_web --> snuba
sentry_web --> memcached
sentry_web --> postgres
sentry_web --> redis
snuba --> kafka
snuba --> redis
snuba --> clickhouse
kafka --> zookeeper
sentry_web --> sentry_worker["Sentry (worker)"]
sentry_worker --> memcached
sentry_worker --> redis
sentry_worker --> postgres
sentry_worker --> symbolicator

## Event pipeline

How an event gets saved. Edges represent data flow through system.

This graph is extremely simplified mostly due to layout constraints. Missing from this graph:

* How Relay fetches project configs. Answer: from sentry-web
* How Relay caches project configs. Answer: In memory, and in Redis
* How Relay counts events and keeps track of quotas. Answer: more Redis
* Symbolicator as auxilliary service to symbolicate-event
* How alerting is triggered. Answer: postprocess-event, a Celery task which is responsible for alerting (spawned by a Kafka consumer in Sentry reading from eventstream)
* Possibly more

For more information read [Path of an event through Relay](https://getsentry.github.io/relay/relay_server/index.html#path-of-an-event-through-relay) and [Event Ingestion Pipeline](https://getsentry.github.io/event-ingestion-graph/).
