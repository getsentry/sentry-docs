title: "Feature Flags"
---

Feature flags are controlled in Sentry at the commit and configuration level. At this time there is built-in way to modify them in production in real-time.

You can find a list of features available by looking at `sentry/features/__init__.py`. They're declared on the `FeatureManager` like so:

```python
default_manager.add("organizations:onboarding", OrganizationFeature)  # NOQA
```

The feature can be enabled with the following in your `config.py`:

```python
SENTRY_FEATURES["organizations:onboarding"] = True
```

You can modify the state of [feature flags in tests](/testing/#setting-options-and-feature-flags) using a context manger.

# Creating a new Feature Flag

## Determine what scope the feature should have

Features can be scoped by organization, and projects. If you're not confident
you want a project feature, create an organization level one. In this example
we'll build a feature called `test-feature` scoped at the *organization* level.

## Add your feature to server.py

Server.py (`/src/sentry/conf/server.py`) contains many of the default settings
in the application. Here you will add your feature, and decide what default
value it should hold unless specified by the user.

The `SENTRY_FEATURES` dictionary contains all the features in the application
with their corresponding scope. Your feature should start off disabled by default:

```python
SENTRY_FEATURES = {
    'organizations:test-feature': False,
    'auth:register': True,
    # ...
    'projects:minidump': False,
}
```

## Add your feature to the FeatureManager

The `FeatureManager` handles the application features. We add all the features
to the `FeatureManager`, including the type of feature we want to add to the
file `/src/sentry/features/__init__.py`.

In our case, it is

```python
default_manager.add('organizations:test-feature', OrganizationFeature)
```

## Add it to the Organization Model Serializer

The Organization model serializer
(`src/sentry/api/serializers/models/organization.py`) builds a list
called `feature_list` that is given to the front-end to use. By default the all
features are checked and those that are present are added into the list. If
your feature requires additional custom logic you will have to update the
organization serializer

### Using Model Flags (Less common)

Sometimes a flag on the model is used to indicate a feature flag as shown
below. This is not recommended unless there is a specific reason to make
changes to the model. For example, the `require_2fa` flag affects behavior on
the backend to enforce two-factor authentication.

```python
feature_list = []

if getattr(obj.flags, 'allow_joinleave'):
    feature_list.append('open-membership')
if not getattr(obj.flags, 'disable_shared_issues'):
    feature_list.append('shared-issues')
if getattr(obj.flags, 'require_2fa'):
    feature_list.append('require-2fa')
```

# Checking your feature

## In Python code

The FeatureManager's `has` method checks see if the feature exists. The has
method takes in the feature's name, the object that corresponds to the scope of
the feature *(i.e. an organization for an organization level feature or
a project for a project level feature)*, and the actor (aka user). In our case
the feature will be added like:

```python
if features.has('organizations:test-feature', obj, actor=user):
    feature_list.append('test-feature')
```

which only adds the feature to the `feature_list` if that feature is enabled for
the organization and the type of user given. Note that when we give the feature
to the frontend, we remove the scope prefix, and
our `'organizations:test-feature'` becomes `'test-feature'`.

## In JavaScript

There is a difference between using the flag in Sentry and in GetSentry. At this
stage you're not quite ready to use your feature flag in GetSentry, but you are
able to use it inside Sentry.

## Declarative features with the Feature component

React uses a declarative programming paradigm. As such, we have a utility
component that we use to hide components based on the feature flags available to
a organization/project

```jsx
import Feature from 'app/components/acl/feature';

<Feature features={['test-feature']}>
  <MyComponentToFlag/>
</Feature>
```

## Imperitive feature flag checks

There are some exceptions when React components are generated imperatively (e.g.
headers/columns for Tables). In difficult times like these, the `Organization`
/ `Project` object has a array of the feature flags, which you can use in this
way:

```jsx
const {organization} = this.props;

// Method 2
organization.features.includes('test-feature') // evals to True/False
```

# Enabling features in development

In Sentry you can run `sentry devserver` to view your changes in development
mode. If you would like to view a change behind a feature flag, you will need to
open the file `~/.sentry/sentry.config.py` on your local machine. This file
contains your local settings for the sentry application, and can be viewed and
edited. If you would like to toggle a flag on or off, add this to your
configuration file:

```python
SENTRY_FEATURES['organizations:test-feature'] = True
```

Where `SENTRY_FEATURES` will correspond to the `SENTRY_FEATURES` from `step 2`.
Set it to `True` if you'd like the feature to be available and `False` if not.

# Enabling your feature in production

If you want to enable your feature for a subset of production users, you will
need to update the feature handlers in getsentry.

In `getsentry/features.py` you will find a collection of feature handlers that
enable various early adopter and billing related features.

## Releasing a feature to a subset of organization

You can enable a feature for a specific list of organization slugs by adding
your feature and the list of organizations to the `FEATURE_EARLY_ADOPTERS`
dictionary.

## Releasing a feature to organizations with specific plans

Enabling a feature for customers on specific plans will require creating
a FeatureHandler and updating the plan catalog.

1. Update the feature list in `getsentry/accounts/plans.py` This list contains
   the feature name, a customer facing name and a short description of the
   feature.
2. Update the relevant plans in `getsentry/accounts/plans.py` . For example if
   your feature is only available on Business plans, ensure that the plan
   definition includes the `test-feature` flag in its list of features.
3.  Create a feature handler for our feature. 

```python
class TestFeatureFeatureHandler(features.FeatureHandler):
    # Tell FeatureManager which feature this handler is for.
    features = {"organizations:test-feature"}

    def has(self, feature, actor):
        org = feature.organization

        try:
            sub = Subscription.get_for_organization(org)
        except Subscription.DoesNotExist:
            return False

        plan_features = active_features(sub)
        return "test-feature" in plan_features
```

The `has` method of a feature handler in getsentry should always return
a boolean. This prevents fall through to the `SENTRY_FEATURES` dictionary.

## Releasing to organizations of a specific plan incrementally

When releasing a large or potentially disruptive feature you may want to enable
it for a percentage of organizations incrementally. For example, on monday it is
available to 10% of users, and increasing the percentage of customers by 10%
each day.

1. Regsiter an integer typed option in sentry. Eg. `test-feature.rollout-rate`
   . The default value should be `0`.
2. Create a feature handler that uses the `PercentageRollout` mixin 

```python
class TestFeatureFeatureHandler(features.FeatureHandler, PercentageRollout):
    # Tell FeatureManager which feature this handler is for.
    features = {"organizations:test-feature"}

    def has(self, feature, actor):
        org = feature.organization
    # Other conditions can go here.
    return self.in_rollout_group(org.id, 'test-feature.rollout-rate')
```

3. Work with operations to set and increase the value of your option as
   required.

## After launch

After your feature has been mainlined and is available for all hosted customers.
You should go back and enable the feature in `conf/server.py` which will enable
the feature for on-premise users.

If your feature switch is doesn't have an 'off' mode you should go back and
remove the feature switch checks and feature flag as feature flags are not free.
