## Create a Vercel App

To use the Vercel integration you'll need to create your own integration in Vercel. To start, click "Create" in the [Integrations Developer Console](https://vercel.com/dashboard/integrations/console).

When configuring the app:
* Set the `Redirect URL` to `{YOUR_DOMAIN}/extensions/vercel/configure/`
* Set the `Webhook URL` to `{YOUR_DOMAIN}/extensions/vercel/delete/` and subscribe to the following events:
  * Deployment Created
  * Configuration Removed
* Leave the `Configuration URL` empty

Take note of your client ID, client secret, and integration URL slug (the value you entered in the URL Slug field. This will be used to construct the integration installation URL). Add those to `config.yml` like this:

```yml
# Vercel #
vercel.client-id: your-client-id
vercel.client-secret: your-secret
vercel.integration-slug: your-integration-slug
```

Then, go to your integration in Vercel and click on `View in Marketplace`. Add the integration and then follow our [documentation on configuring the Vercel integration](https://docs.sentry.io/product/integrations/deployment/vercel/#configure) to use the integration.
