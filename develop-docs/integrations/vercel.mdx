## Create a Vercel App

To use the Vercel integration you'll need to create your own integration in Vercel. To start, click "Create" in the [Integrations Developer Console](https://vercel.com/dashboard/integrations/console).

When configuring the app, under the **Settings** section:

- Set the `Redirect URL` to `{YOUR_DOMAIN}/extensions/vercel/configure/`
- Set the following API Scopes:

| API Scope                     | Value      |
| ----------------------------- | ---------- |
| Integration Configuration     | Read/Write |
| Projects                      | Read/Write |
| Project Environment Variables | Read/Write |
| Teams                         | Read       |
| Current User                  | Read       |

- Set the `Webhook URL` to `{YOUR_DOMAIN}/extensions/vercel/delete/` and subscribe to the following events:
  - Deployment Created
  - Configuration Removed
- Leave the `Configuration URL` empty

After saving, take note of your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** which will help authenticate Sentry, and your **URL Slug** which will setup the installation URL.
Add those to `config.yml` like this:

```yml
# Vercel #
vercel.client-id: your-client-id
vercel.client-secret: your-client-secret
vercel.integration-slug: your-url-slug
```

Then, go to your integration in Vercel and click on `View in Marketplace`. Add the integration and then follow our [documentation on configuring the Vercel integration](https://docs.sentry.io/product/integrations/deployment/vercel/#configure) to use the integration.
