Create an [Atlassian Cloud Developer Instance](http://go.atlassian.com/cloud-dev)

Atlassian offers a development-specific org option, different from simply having a personal Jira organization. Even if you already have a personal Jira org, it's worth creating a development org, because it will correctly set a number of necessary options for you automatically.

Set Up ngrok

(This is only necessary if you're developing locally.) [Download](https://ngrok.com/download) and [set up](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/) ngrok, then start an ngrok server.

Configure Jira Settings

1. If you don't have any projects in your Jira org yet, create a new project.
2. In the navigation bar at the top of the screen, go to Apps > Manage Your Apps.
3. At the bottom of the Manage Apps page, click Settings (1).
4. Select Enable Development Mode and Enable Private Listings (2), and click Apply.

5. Reload the page, and Upload App should appear next to Build a New App.
6. Click Upload App and upload the Atlassian Connect descriptor by using the URL Â `https://{YOUR_SENTRY_DOMAIN}/extensions/jira/descriptor/`. Note that if you are running a local devserver, `YOUR_SENTRY_DOMAIN` will be your ngrok (or other tunneling service) domain.
