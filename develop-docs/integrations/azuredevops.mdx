## Create an Azure application

Log into your Azure DevOps account, creating one if needed. Ensure you have a project set up.

To use the Azure DevOps integration you'll need to create an application. To start, visit [this page](https://app.vsaex.visualstudio.com/app/register) to register the app. 

When configuring the app, use the following values:

| Setting                         | Value                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Authorization callback URL      | https://yourname.ngrok.io/extensions/vsts/setup/                                                   |
| Authorized Scopes               | Code (read), Work Items (read and write), Service Endpoints (read, query and manage), Graph (read) |

Take note of your App ID and Client Secret (the long one you have to click to show) and add those to `config.yml` like this:

```yml
# Azure DevOps #
vsts.client-id: your-app-id
vsts.client-secret: your-client-secret
```

Follow our [documentation on installing and configuring the Azure DevOps integration](https://docs.sentry.io/product/integrations/azure-devops/) to finish installation and use the integration.
