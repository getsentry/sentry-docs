## Create a Heroku application

Create an account on [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com) and create an app.

Follow the [instructions](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git) to set up a Heroku app using the command line tool and deploy process.

**NOTE**: If you're doing local Sentry development, ensure Heroku webhooks can call your local Sentry environment by using a service like Ngrok to expose your local environment to the internet.


## Set up the Sentry plugin

Create a Sentry project that will be associated with your Heroku app, taking note of the project DSN.

Update your Heroku application configuration variables by going through the Heroku Dashboard >> Settings >> Reveal Config Vars and ensure the `SENTRY_DSN` variable to points to your domain's DSN for your project, and not sentry.io.

Follow our [documentation on configuring the Heroku plugin](https://docs.sentry.io/product/integrations/deployment/heroku/) to setup and install the plugin.

Deploy a change to your Heroku app which triggers a deploy in Heroku. The Heroku webhooks will callback Sentry to create a new release.
