## Create a Discord bot

To use Sentry's Discord integration in your Sentry instance, you must first create a Discord bot. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and click __New Application__.

After you create the bot, you should be redirected to its settings.

## Update your Sentry configuration

Sentry needs the following Discord credentials, which you can find in the bot's settings:

- *Application ID* and *Public key* are located in __General Information__.
- *Client secret* is located in __OAuth2__ > __General__.
- *Bot token* is located in __Bot__.

Add these to your Sentry instance's <code>config.yml</code> as follows:

```yaml
discord.application-id: "<application id>"
discord.public-key: "<public key>"
discord.client-secret: "<client secret>"
discord.bot-token: "<bot token>"
```

**NOTE**: If you're doing local Sentry development, you should use a tool like Ngrok and add `system.url-prefix: "https://<your_subdomain>.ngrok.io"` to your `~/.sentry/config.yml`. Otherwise, installing the Discord bot won't work, as it will not be able to communicate with your local Sentry instance.

After you update the <code>config.yml</code>, restart your Sentry server to continue the setup process.

<Alert title="Note" level="info">
    After changing configuration files, re-run the <code>./install.sh</code> script, to rebuild and restart the containers. See the <Link to="/self-hosted/#configuration">configuration section</Link> for more information.
</Alert>

## Configure your Discord interactions endpoint

Now that Sentry is running and it knows your Discord credentials, we need to set up a way for Discord to interact with Sentry.

Head back to your Discord application settings, navigate to __General Information__ and look for __Interactions Endpoint URL__.

![Interactions Endpoint URL](./interactions_endpoint_url.png)

Here you'll need to enter the Discord interactions endpoint provided by Sentry:
```
Interactions Endpoint URL: {YOUR_DOMAIN}/extensions/discord/interactions/
```

Click __Save Changes__.

<Alert level="info">
When you enter the Interactions Endpoint URL, Discord will try to verify it. The verification will fail if you haven't configured the bot credentials properly, haven't restarted your server since adding them, or don't have your server properly exposed to the internet.
</Alert>

## Configure your Discord OAuth2 Redirect URI

Navigate to __OAuth2__ > __General__ and look for __Redirects__.

Here you'll need to enter the Discord setup endpoint:
```
Oauth2 Redirect URI: {YOUR_DOMAIN}/extensions/discord/setup/
```

Click __Save Changes__.


You're now all set to use the Discord integration in Sentry! See our [documentation on installing and configuring the Discord integration](https://docs.sentry.io/product/integrations/notification-incidents/discord/) for some next steps.
