## Create a GitLab App

To use the GitLab integration you'll need to create an OAuth app in GitLab. To start, visit [Applications](https://gitlab.com/oauth/applications/). 

When configuring the app, use the following values:

| Setting                         | Value                                         |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Name                            | Sentry                                        |
| Redirect URI                    | `{YOUR_DOMAIN}/extensions/gitlab/setup/`      |
| Scopes                          | api                                           |

Take note of your application ID and secret as you'll need it in the next step. 

Follow our [documentation on installing and configuring the GitLab integration](https://docs.sentry.io/workflow/integrations/gitlab/) to finish installation and use the integration.
