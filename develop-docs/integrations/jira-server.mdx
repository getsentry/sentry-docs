Follow our [documentation on configuring the Jira Server integration](https://docs.sentry.io/product/integrations/project-mgmt/jira/#jira-server) to setup and install the integration, replacing any mention of sentry.io with your domain. For example, the application URL will be `{YOUR_DOMAIN}/extensions/jira_server/setup/` instead of `https://sentry.io/extensions/jira_server/setup/`.
