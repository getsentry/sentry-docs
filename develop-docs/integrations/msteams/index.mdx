You will need to be a Microsoft Teams Administrator to perform some of the required steps.

</Alert>

## Create the Sentry App

1. Visit the [Developer Portal](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/apps). Note: You may have to sign up for the [MS 365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program) if you're having trouble accessing this.
2. Click "New App".
3. Name your app (something specific to you to make it easier to find, e.g. `Bob's Sentry`).
4. Under "Basic Information" use the following values (all other fields are optional and may be left blank):

| Setting                   | Value                       |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Short description         | enter anything              |
| Long description          | enter anything              |
| Developer or company name | Sentry                      |
| Website                   | https://www.sentry.io       |
| Privacy policy            | https://sentry.io/privacy/  |
| Terms of use              | https://www.sentry.io/terms/|


5. Hit "Save" at the bottom of the page.
6. On the left hand sidebar click "App features" >> "Bot" >> "Create a new bot" >> "New bot". You may name this whatever you like.
7. Enter the bot endpoint address as `{YOUR_DOMAIN}/extensions/msteams/webhook/` and hit "Save". Take note of your bot ID (shown in the URL, e.g. https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/bots/{BOT-ID}/configure).
8. Go to "Client secrets" and create a secret. Copy the secret as we'll use it later on.
9. To go back, click "Apps" >> Sentry >> "App features" >> "Bot". Then choose the bot you just created from the "Select an existing bot" dropdown.
10. Enable your bot to "Only send notifications (one-way conversations)" and select "Personal" and "Team" as the scopes.

11. Click "Add a command" and call it anything you like (e.g. `/sentry`). Give your command a description, select "Personal" and "Team" as the scopes, then click "Add".

12. Hit "Save" at the bottom of the page.


## Set up config.yml

Take the values from before and add them to the `config.yml` file as shown below:

```yml
# Microsoft Teams #
msteams.client-id: 'your-bot-client-id'
msteams.client-secret: 'your-bot-secret'
```

## Installation

<Alert title="Note">

We have encountered recent issues with this installation method. For a smoother experience, please refer to the Troubleshooting section for alternative steps.

</Alert>

1. At the top right of the screen click "Preview in Teams".
2. Select "Add to a team" in the resulting popup, and choose the team(s) you want to install the app on.

You should see a message in the General channel that says "Welcome to Sentry for Microsoft Teams". If you do not get this message, it means was something went wrong and you'll need to uninstall, fix the problem, and re-install it.

Follow our [documentation on using the Microsoft Teams integration](https://docs.sentry.io/organization/integrations/notification-incidents/msteams/) to use the integration.

## Troubleshooting

If you're having trouble with installation, try following these steps:

1. Click "Publish to org" in the sidebar.
2. Visit the [manage apps page](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/policies/manage-apps), and find your app in the list by sorting by "Custom App".
3. Click the title of your app, in this case "Sentry".
4. Publish it to the org-wide app catalog.
5. After publishing it, you or your admin for your MS Teams org will need to approve the app before it can be installed on MS Teams. Go to the [Manage apps](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/policies/manage-apps) page, and search for the app (e.g. "Sentry").
6. Click the title of your app, in this case "Sentry", and click "Publish".
7. You should now be able to see the published custom app under the "Built for your org" section in the MS Teams application store.



## Uninstallation

To uninstall the integration, you should uninstall it inside of Teams instead of uninstall it Sentry.

1. Find your Teams
2. Click on the three dotted lines to the right of your Team
3. Press "Manage team"
