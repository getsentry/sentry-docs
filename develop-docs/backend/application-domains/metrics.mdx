Sentry provides an abstraction called ‘metrics’ which is used for internal monitoring, generally timings and various counters.

The default backend simply discards them (though some values are still kept in the internal time series database).

## Sentry Metrics Abstraction

In order to make metrics collection uniform across the entire `sentry` codebase, we have an abstraction which exposes metrics collection with three methods.

- `incr` → emits a counter metric.
- `timing` → emits a distribution metric (with the `second` unit on Sentry metrics).
- `gauge` → emits a gauge metric (temporarily emits a counter, until the infra work is done).

Each method has three main parameters:

- `key` → the name that uniquely identifies the metric. You will use the name to specify the metric when you want to plot it.
- `value` → the value of the value. You will plot the value of the metric.
- `tags` → the tags of the metric. You will use the tags to attach metadata to the metric, which can be helpful for aggregations.

To use the metrics abstraction you will first have to import it:

```python
from sentry.utils import metrics
```

Once imported, you can start emitting metrics:

```python
# Emit a counter.
metrics.incr(
	"counter_name",
	tags={"platform": platform}
)

# Emit a distribution.
metrics.distribution(
	"gauge_name",
	10,
	tags={"nation": nation},
	unit="second",
)

# Emit a gauge.
metrics.gauge(
	"gauge_name",
	10,
	tags={"nation": nation}
)

# Emit a distribution (with default time-based unit).
metrics.timing(
	"distribution_name",
	100,
	tags={"user_segment": user_segment}
)
```

If you want to measure how much time a specific piece of code takes, you can use:

```python
# Emit a distribution metric of the execution time of the function.
with metrics.timer("my_func"):
	my_func()
```

## Statsd Backend

```python
SENTRY_METRICS_BACKEND = 'sentry.metrics.statsd.StatsdMetricsBackend'
SENTRY_METRICS_OPTIONS = {
    'host': 'localhost',
    'port': 8125,
}
```

## Datadog Backend

Datadog will require you to install the `datadog` package into your Sentry environment:

```bash
$ pip install datadog
```

In your `sentry.conf.py`:

```python
SENTRY_METRICS_BACKEND = 'sentry.metrics.datadog.DatadogMetricsBackend'
SENTRY_METRICS_OPTIONS = {
    'api_key': '...',
    'app_key': '...',
    'tags': {},
}
```

Once installed, the Sentry metrics will be emitted to the [Datadog REST API](https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/?lang=python#post-time-series-points) over HTTPS.

## DogStatsD Backend

Using the DogStatsD backend requires a [Datadog Agent](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/) to be running with the DogStatsD backend (on by default at port 8125).

You must also install the `datadog` Python package into your Sentry environment:

```bash
$ pip install datadog
```

In your `sentry.conf.py`:

```python
SENTRY_METRICS_BACKEND = 'sentry.metrics.dogstatsd.DogStatsdMetricsBackend'
SENTRY_METRICS_OPTIONS = {
    'statsd_host': 'localhost',
    'statsd_port': 8125,
    'tags': {},
}
```

Once configured, the metrics backend will emit to the DogStatsD server and then flushed periodically to Datadog over HTTPS.
