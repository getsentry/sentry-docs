## Running a worker

Workers are responsible for fetching tasks, executing them and reporting
completion status back to a taskbroker. Workers are run using the `sentry`
command:

```bash
sentry run taskworker
```

## Running a task scheduler

The task-scheduler is responsible for reading the task schedules from
`settings.TASKWORKER_SCHEDULES` and spawning tasks as schedules become due.

```bash
sentry run taskworker-scheduler
```

## Running taskbroker

Taskbroker can be started with `devservices`

```bash
devservices up taskbroker
```
