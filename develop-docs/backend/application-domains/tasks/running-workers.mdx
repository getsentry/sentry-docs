## Running a worker

Workers are responsible for fetching tasks, executing them and reporting
completion status back to a taskbroker. Before you can run a worker, you'll need
to [start a taskbroker](#running-taskbroker]). There are a few options for
running workers:

```bash
# Run a worker in the foreground
sentry run taskworker

# Run a worker as part of the devserver
sentry devserver --workers

# Foreground the worker from a devservices mode like `ingest`
devservices foreground taskworker
```

## Running a task scheduler

The task-scheduler is responsible for reading the task schedules from
`settings.TASKWORKER_SCHEDULES` and spawning tasks as schedules become due.

```bash
sentry run taskworker-scheduler
```

## Running taskbroker

Taskbroker can be started as a background service with `devservices`

```bash
devservices up --mode=taskbroker
```
