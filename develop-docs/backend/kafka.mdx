# Kafka consumers

## Creating a new consumer in Sentry

WIP! This is currently just a checklist.

1. Add a new entry in the `KAFKA_CONSUMERS` key in
   `src/sentry/consumers/__init__.py`.

2. Create ops PR for adding your consumer to
   `k8s/services/getsentry/consumer-deployment.yaml`.

3. In the Sentry Consumers metrics dashboard, add a new saved view for your
   consumer.
