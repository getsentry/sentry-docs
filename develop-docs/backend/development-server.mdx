title: Backend Development Server

(*see also: [Frontend Development Server](/frontend/development-server/)*)

It's possible to run Sentry locally without ever having to build the frontend. It requires to circumvent `sentry devserver`. Instead, you configure:

```python
# ~/.sentry/sentry.conf.py
STATIC_URL = "https://sentry.io/_static/{version}"
STATIC_FRONTEND_APP_URL = "https://sentry.io/_static/dist/"
```

...and run:

```shell
sentry run web
```

When you browse `localhost:9001`, the browser will load JavaScript from production instead of your local static folder.

This will do literally nothing except bring up the web workers. You are now responsible to manually:

* Starting Relay if you need it: `sentry devservices attach relay`
* Starting relevant Kafka consumers if you need them (e.g. for ingestion). This highly depends on which dataset you're working on.
* Starting Celery workers using `sentry run worker` to run most kinds of background jobs.

Use `sentry run --help` to see what you might be missing by not running devserver.
