title: "sentry vs getsentry"
---

You'll find numerous references to both `sentry`, the public repository and core of Sentry, and `getsentry`, the proprietary and closed source components used for sentry.io. `getsentry` is the application we deploy to production and contains additional functionality only offered in our SaaS offering.

In most cases, the systems operate very similarly with subtle differences. That is, you can often swap the `sentry` CLI for the `getsentry` CLI and they'll behave the same. In other cases, we have attempted to call out differences in behavior.

If you're not part of the Sentry team, you won't have access to develop on the `getsentry` codebase and you can ignore the related documentation.
