# Using Ngrok

The development server can be operated behind ngrok for when you need to receive traffic from the outside world. This comes up frequently when working with integrations. 

It is recommended to use `getsentry` while working with integrations as it will automatically set up the correct configurations for you.

Note, if the following instructions aren't working and you are using `getsentry`, check if there is some configuration that is set for your environment that is updating the following options and configs:
```
SENTRY_OPTIONS["system.url-prefix"]
SENTRY_OPTIONS["system.base-hostname"]
SENTRY_FEATURES["system:multi-region"]

CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS
ALLOWED_HOSTS
SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN
CSRF_COOKIE_DOMAIN
SUDO_COOKIE_DOMAIN
```
`dev.py` in `getsentry` should automatically set the correct values for these configurations.

## Ngrok in Monolith mode

The following steps will setup ngrok in `monolith` mode:

### Step 1: Create Ngrok Config File
Start off by defining a configuration file for `ngrok`, for example `ngrok.yml`:

```yaml
version: '2'
authtoken: <YOUR-NGROK-AUTHTOKEN>
tunnels:
  acme-org:
    proto: http
    hostname: <yourname>.ngrok.io
    addr: 8000
    host_header: "rewrite"
```

You can grab your auth token from https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken

### Step 2: Start Ngrok
Next start up ngrok with your configuration file:
```shell
ngrok start --all --config ngrok.yml
```

### Step 3: Start Devserver
When starting the devserver, use the `--ngrok` flag:
```shell
getsentry devserver --ngrok=<yourname>.ngrok.io
```

## Ngrok in Silo mode

To debug issues related to integration middleware as well as issues relating to latency induced by RPC calls, you can run your local environment in silo mode. 

To learn more about how silo mode works in the dev environment, refer to <Link to="/environment/#running-siloed-instances"> Running Siloed Instances</Link>.


### Step 1: Split Local DB into Silos
By default `sentry devserver` will run a monolith mode application server. You can also run ``devserver`` with siloed application instances. Before you do, you need to <Link to="/database-migrations/#cloning-a-monolith-database">create split silo databases</Link>.


### Step 2: Create Ngrok Config File
To combine ngrok and local development servers you'll need to reserve multiple domains in ngrok, and create a configuration file for ngrok:

```yaml
version: "2"
authtoken: <YOUR-NGROK-AUTHTOKEN>
tunnels:
  acme-org:
    proto: http
    hostname: acme-org.<yourname>.ngrok.io
    addr: 8000
  control-silo:
    proto: http
    hostname: <yourname>.ngrok.io
    host_header: "rewrite"
    addr: 8000
  region-silo:
    proto: http
    hostname: us.<yourname>.ngrok.io
    addr: 8010
    host_header: "rewrite"
```

### Step 3: Start Ngrok
Next start up ngrok with your configuration file:
```shell
ngrok start --all --config region.yml
```

### Step 4: Start Devserver
In two separate terminal windows, start the devserver for the control and region silos:

```shell
getsentry devserver --ngrok <yourname>.ngrok.io --workers --celery-beat --silo=region
getsentry devserver --ngrok <yourname>.ngrok.io --workers --celery-beat --silo=control
```

This setup will result in both the region and control servers responding to different domains. The multi-region setup with ngrok also enables customer-domains and you'll need ngrok domains for each organization you plan on using. In this configuration, CORS will work similar to production.

### Setting up integrations
When setting up integrations for your local environment and the above setup, you should add the secrets and configurations for the integrations in the `getsentry/conf/settings/devlocal.py` file.
