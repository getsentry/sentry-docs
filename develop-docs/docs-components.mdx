title: "Documentation Components"
---

This documentation uses [gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org/) with [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).
For MDX there are custom components / plugins added which differ from regular
MDX setups.  To see how they are used have a look at the source of this page.

## Code Tabs

Sibling code blocks are automatically merged into a block with tabs to switch
between them.  To prevent two adjacent code blocks to merge separate them with
the `<Break/>` component.

Example of two code blocks merged:

```python
import sentry_sdk
sentry_sdk.init("___PROJECT.DSN___");
```

```javascript 
import * as Sentry from "sentry-browser";
Sentry.init("___PROJECT.DSN___");
// id: ___PROJECT.ID___
// org-slug: ___PROJECT.ORG_SLUG___
// slug: ___PROJECT.SLUG___
```

A second example with three code blocks that have file names set:

```python {filename: hello.py}
#!/usr/bin/env python
print "Hello World"
```

```javascript {filename: hello.js}
#!/usr/bin/env node
console.log("Hello World")
```

```c {filename: hello.c}
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello World\n");
}
```

Another code block with different languages for comparison:

```html {filename: hello.html}
<h1>Hello World</h1>
```

```python {filename: goodbye.py}
print "Goodbye World"
```

```javascript {filename: goodbye.js}
console.log("Goodbye World")
```

Two JavaScript variants where one has an explicit title override:

```javascript
Sentry.init();
```

```javascript {tabTitle: React-Native}
Sentry.init();
```

Code without title:

```
nolang all alone
```

```

No language combined with Python:

```
no lang
```

```python 
print "Python"
```

Three code blocks, where the second forced a break from the first (`<Break/>`):

```python
print "I am block 1"
```

<Break/>

```python {tabTitle: Block 2}
print "I am block 2"
```

```python {tabTitle: Block 3}
print "I am block 3"
```

Example usage in a nested structure:

1.  Creation of the SDK (sometimes this is hidden from the user):

    ```javascript
    Sentry.init({dsn: '___PROJECT.DSN___'});
    ```

    ```python
    sentry_sdk.init('___PROJECT.DSN___')
    ```

```bash
echo "Some code outside"
```

If two blocks share the same language and get merged, they get enumerated:

```text
I am block 1
```

```text
I am block 2
```
