Examples of components for the documentation.

## Code Tabs

First block:

```python
print "Hello World!"
```

```javascript 
console.log("Hello World!")
```

Second block with an added language and filenames:

```python {filename: hello.py}
print "Hello World"
```

```javascript {filename: hello.js}
console.log("Hello World")
```

```c {filename: hello.c}
printf("Hello World\n");
```

Third block:

```html {filename: hello.html}
<h1>Hello World</h1>
```

```python {filename: goodbye.py}
print "Goodbye World"
```

```javascript {filename: goodbye.js}
console.log("Goodbye World")
```

Two JavaScript variants:

```javascript
Sentry.init();
```

```javascript {tabTitle: React-Native}
Sentry.init();
```

Code without title:

```
nolang all alone
```

Code with a forced title bar:

```python {forceTabBar}
print "This forces a bar even though it's alone"
```

No language combined with Python:

```
no lang
```

```python 
print "Python"
```

Three code blocks, where the second forced a break from the first:

```python
print "I am block 1"
```

<Break/>

```python {tabTitle: Block 2}
print "I am block 2"
```

```python {tabTitle: Block 3}
print "I am block 3"
```

In a nested structure

1.  Creation of the SDK (sometimes this is hidden from the user):

    ```javascript
    Sentry.init({dsn: '___DSN___'});
    ```

    ```python
    sentry_sdk.init('___DSN___')
    ```

```bash
echo "Some code outside"
```
