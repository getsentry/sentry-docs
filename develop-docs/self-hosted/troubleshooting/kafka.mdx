## Offset Out Of Range Error

```log
Exception: KafkaError{code=OFFSET_OUT_OF_RANGE,val=1,str="Broker: Offset out of range"}
```

This happens where Kafka and the consumers get out of sync. Possible reasons are:

1. Running out of disk space or memory
2. Having a sustained event spike that causes very long processing times, causing Kafka to drop messages as they go past the retention time
3. Date/time out of sync issues due to a restart or suspend/resume cycle

### Recovery

Note: These solutions may result in data loss when resetting the offset of the snuba consumers.

#### Proper solution

The _proper_ solution is as follows ([reported](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/issues/478#issuecomment-666254392) by [@rmisyurev](https://github.com/rmisyurev)):

1. Receive consumers list:
   ```shell
   docker compose run --rm kafka kafka-consumer-groups --bootstrap-server kafka:9092 --list
   ```
2. Get group info:
   ```shell
   docker compose run --rm kafka kafka-consumer-groups --bootstrap-server kafka:9092 --group snuba-consumers --describe
   ```
3. Watching what is going to happen with offset by using dry-run (optional):
   ```shell
   docker compose run --rm kafka kafka-consumer-groups --bootstrap-server kafka:9092 --group snuba-consumers --topic events --reset-offsets --to-latest --dry-run
   ```
4. Set offset to latest and execute:
   ```shell
   docker compose run --rm kafka kafka-consumer-groups --bootstrap-server kafka:9092 --group snuba-consumers --topic events --reset-offsets --to-latest --execute
   ```

<Alert title="Tip">
You can replace <code>snuba-consumers</code> with other consumer groups or <code>events</code> with other topics when needed.
</Alert>

#### Another option

This option is as follows ([reported](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/issues/1690) by [@gabn88](https://github.com/gabn88)):

1. Set offset to latest and execute:
   ```shell
   docker compose run --rm kafka kafka-consumer-groups --bootstrap-server kafka:9092 --all-groups --all-topics --reset-offsets --to-latest --execute
   ```

Unlike the proper solution, this involves resetting the offsets of all consumer groups and all topics.

#### Nuclear option

The _nuclear option_ is removing all Kafka-related volumes and recreating them which _will_ cause data loss. Any data that was pending there will be gone upon deleting these volumes.

1. Stop the instance:
   ```shell
   docker compose down --volumes
   ```
2. Remove the Kafka & Zookeeper related volumes:
   ```shell
   docker volume rm sentry-kafka
   docker volume rm sentry-zookeeper
   ```

 3. Run the install script again:
    ```shell
    ./install.sh
    ```
 4. Start the instance:
    ```shell
    docker compose up --wait
    ```
## Reducing disk usage

If you want to reduce the disk space used by Kafka, you'll need to carefully calculate how much data you are ingesting, how much data loss you can tolerate and then follow the recommendations on [this awesome StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/52970982/90297) or [this post on our community forum](https://forum.sentry.io/t/sentry-disk-cleanup-kafka/11337/2?u=byk).

You could, however, add these on the Kafka container's environment variables (by [@csvan](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/issues/3389#issuecomment-2453567691)):
```yaml
services:
  kafka:
    # ...
    environment:
      KAFKA_LOG_RETENTION_HOURS: 24
      KAFKA_LOG_CLEANER_ENABLE: true
      KAFKA_LOG_CLEANUP_POLICY: delete
```
