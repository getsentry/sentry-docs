## Offset Out Of Range Error

```log
Exception: KafkaError{code=OFFSET_OUT_OF_RANGE,val=1,str="Broker: Offset out of range"}
```

This happens where Kafka and the consumers get out of sync. Possible reasons are:

1. Running out of disk space or memory
2. Having a sustained event spike that causes very long processing times, causing Kafka to drop messages as they go past the retention time
3. Date/time out of sync issues due to a restart or suspend/resume cycle

### Visualize

You can visualize the Kafka consumers and their offsets by bringing an additional container, such as [Kafka UI](https://github.com/provectus/kafka-ui) or [Redpanda Console](https://github.com/redpanda-data/console) into your Docker Compose.

Kafka UI:
```yaml
kafka-ui:
  image: provectuslabs/kafka-ui:latest
  restart: on-failure
  environment:
    KAFKA_CLUSTERS_0_NAME: "local"
    KAFKA_CLUSTERS_0_BOOTSTRAPSERVERS: "kafka:9092"
    DYNAMIC_CONFIG_ENABLED: "true"
  ports:
    - "8080:8080"
  depends_on:
    - kafka
```

Or, you can use Redpanda Console:
```yaml
redpanda-console:
  image: docker.redpanda.com/redpandadata/console:latest
  restart: on-failure
  entrypoint: /bin/sh
  command: -c "echo \"$$CONSOLE_CONFIG_FILE\" > /tmp/config.yml; /app/console"
  environment:
    CONFIG_FILEPATH: "/tmp/config.yml"
    CONSOLE_CONFIG_FILE: |
      kafka:
        brokers: ["kafka:9092"]
        sasl:
          enabled: false
      schemaRegistry:
        enabled: false
      kafkaConnect:
        enabled: false
  ports:
    - "8080:8080"
  depends_on:
    - kafka
```

Ideally, you want to have zero lag for all consumer groups. If a consumer group has a lot of lag, you need to investigate whether it's caused by a disconnected consumer (e.g., a Sentry/Snuba container that's disconnected from Kafka) or a consumer that's stuck processing a certain message. If it's a disconnected consumer, you can either restart the container or reset the Kafka offset to 'earliest.' Otherwise, you can reset the Kafka offset to 'latest.'

### Recovery

<Alert level="warning" title="Warning">
These solutions may result in data loss for the duration of your Kafka event retention (defaults to 24 hours) when resetting the offset of the consumers.
</Alert>

#### Proper solution

The _proper_ solution is as follows ([reported](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/issues/478#issuecomment-666254392) by [@rmisyurev](https://github.com/rmisyurev)). This example uses `snuba-consumers` with `events` topic. Your consumer group name and topic name may be different.

1. Shutdown the corresponding Sentry/Snuba container that's using the consumer group (You can see the corresponding containers by inspecting the `docker-compose.yml` file):
   ```shell
   docker compose stop snuba-errors-consumer snuba-outcomes-consumer snuba-outcomes-billing-consumer
   ```
2. Receive consumers list:
   ```shell
   docker compose run --rm kafka kafka-consumer-groups --bootstrap-server kafka:9092 --list
   ```
3. Get group info:
   ```shell
   docker compose run --rm kafka kafka-consumer-groups --bootstrap-server kafka:9092 --group snuba-consumers --describe
   ```
4. Watching what is going to happen with offset by using dry-run (optional):
   ```shell
   docker compose run --rm kafka kafka-consumer-groups --bootstrap-server kafka:9092 --group snuba-consumers --topic events --reset-offsets --to-latest --dry-run
   ```
5. Set offset to latest and execute:
   ```shell
   docker compose run --rm kafka kafka-consumer-groups --bootstrap-server kafka:9092 --group snuba-consumers --topic events --reset-offsets --to-latest --execute
   ```
6. Start the previously stopped Sentry/Snuba containers:
   ```shell
   docker compose start snuba-errors-consumer snuba-outcomes-consumer snuba-outcomes-billing-consumer
   ```
<Alert level="info" title="Tips">
* You can replace <code>snuba-consumers</code> with other consumer groups or <code>events</code> with other topics when needed.
* You can reset the offset to "earliest" instead of "latest" if you want to start from the beginning.
* If you have Kafka UI or Redpanda Console, you can reset the offsets through the web UI instead of the CLI.
</Alert>

#### Another option

This option is as follows ([reported](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/issues/1690) by [@gabn88](https://github.com/gabn88)):

1. Set offset to latest and execute:
   ```shell
   docker compose run --rm kafka kafka-consumer-groups --bootstrap-server kafka:9092 --all-groups --all-topics --reset-offsets --to-latest --execute
   ```

Unlike the proper solution, this involves resetting the offsets of all consumer groups and all topics.

#### Nuclear option

The _nuclear option_ is removing all Kafka-related volumes and recreating them which _will_ cause data loss. Any data that was pending there will be gone upon deleting these volumes.

1. Stop the instance:
   ```shell
   docker compose down --volumes
   ```
2. Remove the the Kafka volume:
   ```shell
   docker volume rm sentry-kafka
   ```

 3. Run the install script again:
    ```shell
    ./install.sh
    ```
 4. Start the instance:
    ```shell
    docker compose up --wait
    ```
## Reducing disk usage

If you want to reduce the disk space used by Kafka, you'll need to carefully calculate how much data you are ingesting, how much data loss you can tolerate and then follow the recommendations on [this awesome StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/52970982/90297) or [this post on our community forum](https://forum.sentry.io/t/sentry-disk-cleanup-kafka/11337/2?u=byk).

You could, however, add these on the Kafka container's environment variables (by [@csvan](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/issues/3389#issuecomment-2453567691)):
```yaml
services:
  kafka:
    # ...
    environment:
      KAFKA_LOG_RETENTION_HOURS: 24
      KAFKA_LOG_CLEANER_ENABLE: true
      KAFKA_LOG_CLEANUP_POLICY: delete
```
