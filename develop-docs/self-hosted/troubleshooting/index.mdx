Please keep in mind that the [self-hosted repository](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted) is geared towards low traffic loads (less than ~1 million submitted Sentry events per month). Folks needing larger setups or having event spikes can expand from here based on their specific needs and environments. If this is not your cup of tea, you are always welcome to [try out hosted Sentry](https://sentry.io/signup/).

## General

You can see the logs of each service by running `docker compose logs <service_name>`. You can use the `-f` flag to "follow" the logs as they come in, and use the `-t` flag for timestamps. If you don't pass any service names, you will get the logs for all running services. See the [reference for the logs command](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/logs/) for more info.

## Other

If you are still stuck, you can always visit our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/issues) to search for existing issues or create a new issue and ask for help. You can also visit [Sentry Community Discord server](https://discord.gg/sentry) on #self-hosted channel. Please keep in mind that we expect the community to help itself, but Sentry employees also try to monitor and answer questions when they have time.
