## Nodestore table growing rapidly

[Nodestore](https://develop.sentry.dev/backend/application-domains/nodestore/) is used to store key/value data. The `nodestore_node` table can grow rapidly, especially when heavily utilising the Performance Monitoring feature as trace data is stored in this table.

The `nodestore_node` table is cleaned up as part of the `cleanup` task, however Postgres may not get a chance to vacuum the table (especially under heavy load), so even the rows may be deleted, they're still taking up space on disk.

You can use `pg-repack` which repacks a table live by creating a new table and copying data across, before dropping the old one. You'll want to run this after the clean up script, and note that as it creates a table, **disk usage will spike before going back down**.

An example script below:

```shell
# Only keep the last 7 days of nodestore data. We heavily use performance monitoring.
docker compose run --rm -T web cleanup --days 7 -m nodestore -l debug
# This ensures pg-repack exists before running as the container gets recreated on upgrades
docker compose run --rm -T postgres bash -c "apt update && apt install -y --no-install-recommends postgresql-14-repack && su postgres -c 'pg_repack -E info -t nodestore_node'"
```

If the script above still does not clear up enough disk space, you can try the following in Postgres. This will lead to data loss in event details. _SENTRY_RETENTION_DAYS_ will need to be filled in manually.
```sql
DELETE FROM public.nodestore_node WHERE "timestamp" < NOW() - INTERVAL '[SENTRY_RETENTION_DAYS] DAY';
VACUUM FULL public.nodestore_node;
```

`VACUUM FULL` actively compacts tables by writing a complete new version of the table file with no dead space. This minimizes the size of the table, but can take a long time. It also requires extra disk space for the new copy of the table, until the operation completes.

For higher throughput events, it is recommended to use community implementation of Nodestore that's backed by blob storage such as S3 or similar.
