## Container Healthcheck

There may be some circumstances which you may want to increase or decrease healthcheck interval, timeout or retries for your custom needs. This can be achieved by editing `HEALTHCHECK_INTERVAL`, `HEALTHCHECK_TIMEOUT`, `HEALTHCHECK_RETRIES` variables' values in `.env`.

Occasionally, you might see an error like this
```
container for service "${servicename}" is unhealthy
```

This can usually be resolved by running `docker compose down` and `docker compose up --wait` or rerunning the install script.

## Docker Network Conflicting IP Address

Self-hosted Sentry is using Docker's bridge networking, in which use a specific private IP range. By default, Docker uses `172.17.0.0/16` range (`172.17.0.0`-`172.17.255.255`). This may cause conflict with your private network. You can change Docker's default IP range by configuring the `/etc/docker/daemon.json` file. If the file does not exists, you can create it yourself.

Assuming your safe IP range is `10.147.0.0/16` and `10.146.0.0/16`, your configuration would be:

```json
{
    "default-address-pools": [
   {
     "base": "10.147.0.0/16",
     "size": 24
   },
   {
     "base": "10.146.0.0/16",
     "size": 24
   }
 ]
}
```

To apply new Docker daemon configuration, restart your Docker service with `systemctl restart docker`.

Make sure you are using [valid private IP ranges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserved_IP_addresses), that is between these ranges:
- `10.0.0.0/8` (address range of `10.0.0.0`–`10.255.255.255`)
- `100.64.0.0/10` (address range of `100.64.0.0`–`100.127.255.255`)
- `172.16.0.0/12` (address range of `172.16.0.0`–`172.31.255.255`)
- `192.0.0.0/24` (address range of `192.0.0.0`–`192.0.0.255`)
- `192.168.0.0/16` (address range of `192.168.0.0`–`192.168.255.255`)
- `198.18.0.0/15` (address range of `198.18.0.0`–`198.19.255.255`)

## Logs Disk Usage

If you are suspecting persisted logs from Docker container logs consumes a lot of your disk space, you can configure the amount of persisted logs on Docker by configuring the `/etc/docker/daemon.json` file. If the file does not exists, you can create it yourself.

```json
{
  "log-driver": "local",
  "log-opts": {"max-size": "10m", "max-file": "3"}
}
```

To apply new Docker daemon configuration, restart your Docker service with `systemctl restart docker`.

If you want to delete immediate Docker logs, you can execute this as `root` user:

```shell
truncate -s 0 /var/lib/docker/containers/**/*-json.log
```

## Image and Builder Cleanup

Executing `./install.sh` will build a new Sentry Docker container, executing it often might cause Docker to consume your disk space. You can safely prune old or unneeded Docker containers, image, or builder to re-acquire used disk space. Executing these will not affect current running containers and volumes.

```shell
docker container prune
docker builder prune
docker image prune --all
# WARNING: Executing "volume prune" might delete `sentry-vroom` volume as it's not an external volume.
docker volume prune
docker network prune
```

Append `-f` flag for no confirmation on deletions.
