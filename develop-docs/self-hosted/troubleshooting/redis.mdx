Redis is used both as a transactional data store and a work queue of Celery in the self-hosted setup. For this reason, it may get overwhelmed during event spikes. We have made some significant improvements regarding this starting from version `20.10.1`. If you are still having issues, you may look into scaling out Redis itself or switching to a different Celery broker, such as [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/).
