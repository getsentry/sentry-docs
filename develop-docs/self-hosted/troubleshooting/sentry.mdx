## CSRF verification failed

Since version 24.1.0, Sentry migrated to Django 4 which contains stricter CSRF protection. By default, the trusted CSRF origins is set to your `system.url-prefix`, but in some cases where your Sentry deployment can be accessed from multiple domains, you will need to configure `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` on your `sentry.conf.py` file.

```python
# Assuming your Sentry instance can be accessed from sentry.example.com, 10.100.10.10 and 127.0.0.1.
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS = ["https://sentry.example.com", "http://10.100.10.10", "http://127.0.0.1:9000"]
```

See [Django's documentation on CSRF](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/settings/#std-setting-CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS) for further detail.

## Containers taking too much CPU/RAM usage

If you're seeing a higher incoming traffic load, then it's expected. If this is the case, you might want to increase your machine resources.

However, if you have very low incoming traffic and the CPU/RAM constantly spikes, you might want to check on your `top` (or `htop`, or similar) command to see which process are taking the most resources. You can then track down the corresponding Docker container and see if there are any logs that might help you identify the issue.

Usually, most containers that are not a dependency (like Postgres or Kafka) will consume some good amount of CPU & RAM during startup. If they are experiencing a [bootloop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booting#Bootloop), it usually comes down to invalid configuration or a broken dependency.

## `sentry-data` volume not being cleaned up

You may see the `sentry-data` taking too much disk space. You can clean it manually (or putting the cleanup cronjob in place).

Find the Docker mountpoint for the volume by executing:
```bash
docker volume inspect sentry-data

# Or if you prefer to do it directly (assuming you have `jq` on your system):
docker volume inspect sentry-data | jq -r .[0].Mountpoint
```

Then run the following command to remove the contents of the volume for the last 30 days (change the `30` to whatever you want, it's in days):
```bash
# `/var/lib/docker/volumes/sentry-data/_data` refers to the mountpoint of the volume
# from the output of the previous command. Change it if it's different.
find /var/lib/docker/volumes/sentry-data/_data -type f -mtime +30 -delete
```

## Background workers haven't checked in recently

If you are seeing an error such as

```
Background workers haven’t checked in recently. It seems that you have a backlog of 200 tasks. Either your workers aren’t running or you need more capacity.
```

you may benefit from using additional, dedicated workers. This is achieved by creating new `worker` services in `docker-compose.override.yml` and tying them to specific queues using the `-Q queue_name` argument. An example would be:

```yaml
worker1:
    << : *sentry_defaults
    command: run worker -Q events.process_event
```

## Cannot Load JavaScript or CSS Files From Web Interface

If you are running your Sentry instance behind a CDN like Cloudflare, Fastify, or the like, you may see some errors of invalid JavaScript or CSS files being loaded from the web interface. This is caused by some static asset files that are already optimized by the bundlers, but aren't being served with minified extensions (for example, `.min.js`). Therefore, the CDN that you are using will try to optimize the files a second time, which will result in corrupted files.

Some known paths where you may see this error:
* _static/dist/sentry/entrypoints/sentry.css
* _static/dist/sentry/entrypoints/app.js

To fix this, you can disable the auto optimization performed by your CDN.
