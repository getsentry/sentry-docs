title: 'Self-Hosted Sentry'
---

In addition to making its source code available publicly, Sentry offers and maintains a minimal setup that works out-of-the-box for simple use cases. This repository also serves as a blueprint for how various Sentry services connect for a complete setup, which is useful for folks willing to maintain larger installations. For the sake of simplicity, we have chosen to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) for this, along with a bash-based install and upgrade script.

## Getting Started

Our recommendation is to download the [latest release of the self-hosted repository](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/releases/latest), and then run `./install.sh` inside this directory. This script will take care of all the things you need to get started, including a base-line configuration, and then will tell you to run `docker-compose up -d` to start Sentry. Sentry binds to port `9000` by default. You should be able to reach the login page at [http://127.0.0.1:9000](http://127.0.0.1:9000/).

### Installing Behind a Proxy

In some enterprise setups there is no direct Internet connection, so you must use an HTTP proxy server. How do you install Sentry in this environment? Let us assume:

1. Your Sentry installation is running on Linux.
2. `http://proxy:3128` is your proxy address.
3. `127.0.0.0/8` is the only network that should be accessed without a proxy.

Here are the steps to follow:

1. Set `http_proxy`, `https_proxy` and `no_proxy` variables in the `/etc/environment` file.
2. To make the `docker pull` command respect your proxy settings, create a `/etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/http-proxy.conf` file with these contents:
```
[Service]
Environment="HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy:3128"
Environment="HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy:3128"
Environment="NO_PROXY=127.0.0.0/8"
```
3. Run `systemctl daemon-reload` and restart Docker with `systemctl restart docker.service`.

From there you can run `./install.sh` like usual.

By default Sentry sends anonymous usage statistics to the Sentry team. It helps to improve the product. Also there can be different external integrations with third party services like Slack or Twilio. To make these features work it's required to allow Docker containers to access the Internet. To add your proxy environment variables into Sentry's Docker containers, create `~/.docker/config.json` with these contents:

```json
{
 "proxies":
 {
   "default":
   {
     "httpProxy": "http://proxy:3128",
     "httpsProxy": "http://proxy:3128",
     "noProxy": "relay,web,sentry,127.0.0.0/8"
   }
 }
}
```

You can disable this feature by adding `SENTRY_BEACON = False` into `sentry.conf.py` file.

## Configuration

You very likely will want to adjust the default configuration for Sentry. These facilities are available for that purpose:

1. **`sentry/config.yml`**—Contains most, if not all, configuration options to adjust. This file is generated from [`sentry/config.example.yml`](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/blob/master/sentry/config.example.yml) at the time of installation. The file itself documents the most common configuration options as code comments. Some popular settings in this file include:

    1. `system.url-prefix` (we prompt you to set this at the welcome screen, right after the installation)

    1. `mail.*` (though we do ship with a basic SMTP server)

    1. integrations for GitHub, Slack, etc.

1. **`sentry/sentry.conf.py`**—Contains more advanced configuration. This file is generated from [`sentry/sentry.conf.example.py`](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/blob/master/sentry/sentry.conf.example.py) during installation.

1. **`sentry/enhance-image.sh`**—To install plugins and their dependencies or make other modifications to the Sentry base image, copy `sentry/enhance-image.example.sh` to `sentry/enhance-image.sh` and add necessary steps there. For example, you can use `apt-get` to install dependencies and use `pip` to install plugins. After making modifications to `sentry/enhance-image.sh`, run `./install.sh` again to apply them.

1. **Environment variables**—The available keys are defined in [.env](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/blob/master/.env). Use some system-dependent means of setting environment variables if you need to override any of them. To avoid Git changes, simply create a file called `.env.custom` and insert your system-dependent environment variables there. In order to use this, please use `docker-compose --env-file /path/to/.env.custom up -d`.

1. [Geolocation](/self-hosted/geolocation/) uses **a custom configuration file** to conform to the underlying technology.

You can find more about configuring Sentry at [the configuration section of our developer documentation](/config/).

<Alert title="Note" level="info">
  Once you change your configuration, you'll need to restart all Sentry services by running <code>docker-compose restart web worker cron sentry-cleanup</code> (or just <code>docker-compose restart</code> to restart everything).

## Productionalizing

We strongly recommend using a dedicated load balancer in front of your Sentry setup bound to a dedicated domain or subdomain. A dedicated load balancer that does SSL/TLS termination that also forwards the client IP address as Docker Compose internal network (as this is [close to impossible to get otherwise)](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/issues/554) would give you the best Sentry experience. As part of this setup we recommend configuring a load balancer health check against the `/_health/` endpoint using HTTP protocol. This will return a 200 if Sentry is up or a 500 with the list of problems.

Once you have setup a load balancer or reverse proxy to your Sentry instance, you should modify the `system.url-prefix` in the `config.yml` file to match your new URL and protocol. You should also update the SSL/TLS section in the `sentry/sentry.conf.py` script, otherwise you may get CSRF-related errors when performing certain actions such as configuring integrations.

Keep in mind that all this setup uses single-nodes for all services, including Kafka. For larger loads, you'd need a beefy machine with lots of RAM and disk storage. To scale up even further, you are very likely to use clusters with a more complex tool, such as Kubernetes. Due to self-hosted installations' very custom nature, we do not offer any recommendations or guidance around scaling up. We do what works for us for our thousands of customers over at [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/) and would love to have you over when you feel your local install's maintenance becomes a burden instead of a joy.
