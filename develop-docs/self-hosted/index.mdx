title: 'Self-Hosted Sentry'
---

In addition to making its source code available publicly, Sentry offers and maintains a minimal setup that works out-of-the-box for simple use cases. This repository also serves as a blueprint for how various Sentry services connect for a complete setup, which is useful for folks willing to maintain larger installations. For the sake of simplicity, we have chosen to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) for this, along with a bash-based install and upgrade script.

## Getting Started

Our recommendation is to download the [latest release of the onpremise repository](https://github.com/getsentry/onpremise/releases/latest), and then run `./install.sh` inside this directory. This script will take care of all the things you need to get started, including a base-line configuration, and then will tell you to run `docker-compose up -d` to start Sentry. Sentry binds to port `9000` by default. You should be able to reach the login page at [http://127.0.0.1:9000](http://127.0.0.1:9000/).

## Configuration

You very likely will want to adjust the default configuration for Sentry. These facilities are available for that purpose:

1. **`sentry/config.yml`**—Contains most, if not all, configuration options to adjust. This file is generated from [`sentry/config.example.yml`](https://github.com/getsentry/onpremise/blob/master/sentry/config.example.yml) at the time of installation. The file itself documents the most common configuration options as code comments. Some popular settings in this file include:

    1. `system.url-prefix` (we prompt you to set this at the welcome screen, right after the installation)

    1. `mail.*` (though we do ship with a basic SMTP server)

    1. integrations for GitHub, Slack, etc.

1. **`sentry/sentry.conf.py`**—Contains more advanced configuration. This file is generated from [`sentry/sentry.conf.example.py`](https://github.com/getsentry/onpremise/blob/master/sentry/sentry.conf.example.py) during installation.

1. **Environment variables**—The available keys are defined in [.env](https://github.com/getsentry/onpremise/blob/master/.env). Use some system-dependent means of setting environment variables if you need to override any of them.

1. [Geolocation](/self-hosted/geolocation/) uses **a custom configuration file** to conform to the underlying technology.

You can find more about configuring Sentry at [the configuration section of our developer documentation](/config/).

<Alert title="Note" level="info">
  Once you change your configuration, you'll need to restart all Sentry services by running <code>docker-compose restart web worker cron sentry-cleanup</code> (or just <code>docker-compose restart</code> to restart everything).

### Configuration Topics

Here is further information on specific configuration topics related to self-hosting:

- [Custom CA Roots](/self-hosted/custom-ca-roots/)
- [Email](/self-hosted/email/)
- [Geolocation](/self-hosted/geolocation/)
- [Single Sign-On (SSO)](/self-hosted/sso/)

## Productionalizing

We strongly recommend using a dedicated load balancer in front of your Sentry setup bound to a dedicated domain or subdomain. A dedicated load balancer that does SSL/TLS termination that also forwards the client IP address as Docker Compose internal network (as this is [close to impossible to get otherwise)](https://github.com/getsentry/onpremise/issues/554) would give you the best Sentry experience.

Keep in mind that all this setup uses single-nodes for all services, including Kafka. For larger loads, you'd need a beefy machine with lots of RAM and disk storage. To scale up even further, you are very likely to use clusters with a more complex tool, such as Kubernetes. Due to self-hosted installations' very custom nature, we do not offer any recommendations or guidance around scaling up. We do what works for us for our thousands of customers over at [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/) and would love to have you over when you feel your local install's maintenance becomes a burden instead of a joy.
