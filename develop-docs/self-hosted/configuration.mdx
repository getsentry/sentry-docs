## Updating basic configuration

You very likely will want to adjust the default configuration for your Sentry installation as well. These facilities are available for that purpose:

1. **`sentry/config.yml`**—Contains most, if not all, configuration options to adjust. This file is generated from [`sentry/config.example.yml`](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/blob/master/sentry/config.example.yml) at the time of installation. The file itself documents the most common configuration options as code comments. Some popular settings in this file include:

    1. `system.url-prefix` (we prompt you to set this at the welcome screen, right after the installation). But it is recommended to uncomment this and set this to the accessible URL of your self-hosted Sentry installation. If you can't click to the link on emails or your DSN domains are empty, you almost certainly need to fill this out.

    1. `mail.*` (though we do ship with a basic SMTP server)

    1. integrations for GitHub, Slack, etc.

1. **`sentry/sentry.conf.py`**—Contains more advanced configuration. This file is generated from [`sentry/sentry.conf.example.py`](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/blob/master/sentry/sentry.conf.example.py) during installation.

1. **`sentry/enhance-image.sh`**—To install plugins and their dependencies or make other modifications to the Sentry base image, copy `sentry/enhance-image.example.sh` to `sentry/enhance-image.sh` and add necessary steps there. For example, you can use `apt-get` to install dependencies and use `pip` to install plugins. After making modifications to `sentry/enhance-image.sh`, run `./install.sh` again to apply them.

1. **Environment variables**—The available keys are defined in [.env](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/blob/master/.env). Use some system-dependent means of setting environment variables if you need to override any of them. To avoid Git changes, simply create a file called `.env.custom` and insert your system-dependent environment variables there. In order to use this, please use `docker compose --env-file /path/to/.env.custom up --wait`.

1. [Geolocation](/self-hosted/geolocation/) uses **a custom configuration file** to conform to the underlying technology.

You can find more about configuring Sentry at [the configuration section of our developer documentation](/config/).

<Alert title="Note">
  Once you change your configuration, it's highly recommended to re-run <code>./install.sh</code> script rather than restarting all services using <code>docker compose restart</code>. This ensures no other configuration or migrations that might be missing when something is toggled on.
</Alert>

### Event Retention

Sentry comes with a cleanup cron job that prunes events older than `90 days` by default. If you want to change that, you can edit the `SENTRY_EVENT_RETENTION_DAYS` environment variable in `.env` or simply override it in your environment.

### Installing a specific SHA

If you want to install a specific release of Sentry, use the tags/releases on the self-hosted repository.

We continuously push the Docker image for each commit made into [Sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry), and other services such as [Snuba](https://github.com/getsentry/snuba) or [Symbolicator](https://github.com/getsentry/symbolicator) to [our Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/getsentry) and tag the latest version on master as `:nightly`. This is also usually what we have on sentry.io and what the install script uses. You can use a custom Sentry image, such as a modified version that you have built on your own, or refer a specific commit hash as the image tag by setting the `SENTRY_IMAGE` environment variable to that image name before running `./install.sh`:

```bash
SENTRY_IMAGE=getsentry/sentry:83b138090a3078352e3f733de7209fb02ef4f98a ./install.sh
```

Note that this may not work for all commit SHAs as this repository evolves with Sentry and its satellite projects. It is highly recommended to check out a version of this repository that is close to the timestamp of the Sentry commit you are installing.

### Enabling Preview Features

Only features that have reached General Availability (GA) status will be enabled by default for self-hosted. As users, you can try new features before it reaches GA by adding required infrastructure components and feature flags. Preview features are tracked and documented through [GitHub issues with Type: Pre-release Feature labels](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/labels/Type%3A%20Pre-release%20Feature).

### Customize DotEnv (.env) file

Environment specific configurations can be done in the `.env.custom` file. It will be located in the root directory of the Sentry installation, and if it exists then `.env` will be ignored entirely.

By default, there exists no `.env.custom` file. In this case, you can manually add this file by copying the `.env` file to a new `.env.custom` file and adjust your settings in the `.env.custom` file.

Please keep in mind to check the `.env` file for changes, when you perform an upgrade of Sentry, so that you can adjust your `.env.custom` accordingly, if required, as `.env` is ignored entirely if `.env.custom` is present.

For all Docker Compose commands, you should specify your `.env.custom`, otherwise the default `.env` file will be used. Some examples are:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.custom up --wait

# You can also specify the original `.env` file as a fallback if the
# environment variable doesn't exists on the `.env.custom` file.
docker compose --env-file .env --env-file .env.custom up --wait
```
