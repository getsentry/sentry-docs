Starting from 24.8.0+, users will have the ability to choose between two distinct types of self-hosted Sentry deployments.

**Errors Only**

Errors Only self-hosted offers a small subset of features with an emphasis on minimizing system resources. This lightweight option includes only the following features:
1. Issues
2. Alerts
3. Integrations
4. Dashboards
5. Releases
6. Discover

In order to enable errors only self-hosted, you'll need to update your [.env file](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/blob/master/.env) to include `COMPOSE_PROFILES=errors-only`.

**Feature Complete**

This is our default version of self-hosted Sentry. It includes most of the features that are available on our SaaS product. This includes everything offered in the Errors Only version, plus the following:
1. [Traces](https://docs.sentry.io/product/explore/traces/)
2. [Profiles](https://docs.sentry.io/product/explore/profiling/)
3. [Replays](https://docs.sentry.io/product/explore/session-replay/)
4. [Insights](https://docs.sentry.io/product/insights/) (Requests, Queries, Assets, etc)
5. [User Feedback](https://docs.sentry.io/product/user-feedback/)
6. [Insights](https://docs.sentry.io/product/insights/)
7. [Crons](https://docs.sentry.io/product/crons/)
8. [Metrics](https://docs.sentry.io/product/explore/metrics/)

This version of Sentry is enabled by default upon installation. Ensure that your [.env file](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/blob/master/.env) includes `COMPOSE_PROFILES=feature-complete`.
