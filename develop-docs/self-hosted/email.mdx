## Outbound Email

Self-hosted Sentry ships with a built-in outgoing SMTP server powered by [exim4](https://hub.docker.com/r/tianon/exim4). The default configuration is set to use this server. All you need to do is to set a valid address for `mail.from` setting in `config.yml` . Keep in mind that if you start sending too many emails to public addresses, your new server may get marked as a spammer and banned.

If you want to use an external SMTP server you can set the relevant `mail.*` settings in `config.yml` file and ignore the built-in SMTP server. Refer to our [email service documentation](/services/email/) for all the details on what each setting means and does.

## Inbound Email

Sentry has a very limited inboud mail support through [Mailgun](https://documentation.mailgun.com/en/latest/quickstart-receiving.html). You can find all the information regarding how to set this up over at our [inbound email service documentation](/services/email/#inbound-email).
