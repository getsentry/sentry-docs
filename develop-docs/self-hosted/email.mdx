## Outbound Email

Self-hosted Sentry ships with a built-in outgoing SMTP server powered by [exim4](https://hub.docker.com/r/tianon/exim4). The default configuration is set to use this server. All you need to do is to set a valid address for `mail.from` setting in `config.yml` and the [FQDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name) of your Sentry instance for `SENTRY_MAIL_HOST` in `.env`. Keep in mind that if you start sending too many emails to public addresses, your new server may get marked as a spammer and banned.

If you want to use an external SMTP server you can set the relevant `mail.*` settings in `config.yml` file and ignore the built-in SMTP server. Refer to our [email service documentation](/services/email/) for all the details on what each setting means and does. If your MX records usually resolve to internal private network mail handlers, see [this ticket](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/issues/1202) for some pointers.

<Alert title="Warning" level="warning">
  Because of the way configuration is layered, if you update <code>mail</code> settings through the web interface, you will need to also comment out the <code>mail.host: 'smtp'</code> default in your <code>config.yml</code> in order for your desired settings to be picked up.

## Inbound Email

Sentry has very limited inbound mail support through [Mailgun](https://documentation.mailgun.com/en/latest/quickstart-receiving.html). You can find all the information regarding how to set this up over at our [inbound email service documentation](/services/email/#inbound-email).
