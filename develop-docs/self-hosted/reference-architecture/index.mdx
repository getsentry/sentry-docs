This section contains reference architectures for self-hosted Sentry. These are not meant to be used as-is, but as a reference for how to deploy self-hosted Sentry around your existing infrastructure. This section can be used to create a scaling strategy if you have higher traffic loads over time.

Please note that these reference architectures do not take external data storage dependencies into account such as Kafka, Postgres, Redis, S3, etc. If you wish to do so, refer to the [Experimental Configurations](/self-hosted/experimental/) section
