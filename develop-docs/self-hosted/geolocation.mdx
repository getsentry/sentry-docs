title: 'Self-Hosted Geolocation'
---

Sentry can use [MaxMind's free `GeoLite2-City` database](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/) to geolocate IP addresses, providing additional context for error events where the end user's IP address is known and for the session history of users logging into your Sentry installation. We bundle MaxMind's [`geoipupdate`](https://hub.docker.com/r/maxmindinc/geoipupdate) tool for this purpose. To enable IP address geolocation, [sign up for a free MaxMind account](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite2/signup), then tell Sentry about your credentials by placing your MaxMind configuration file at `geoip/GeoIP.conf`.

```
AccountID 012345
LicenseKey foobarbazbuz
EditionIDs GeoLite2-City
```

With this configuration file in place, subsequent runs of Sentry's `install.sh` will refresh the IP address geolocation database. The next time you restart your self-hosted Sentry instance (the `relay` and `web` services, in particular), you should start seeing the latest data. Here's how to confirm that it's working:

1. For the `relay` service: **Dashboards > Errors by Country** should have some purple on it.

1. For the `web` service: **User Settings > Security > Session History** should display country code and region (for example, "US (CA)") underneath the IP addresses in the table.

## Upgrading

The services that consume the `GeoLite2-City.mmdb` file need to know where to find it. New installs will have this set automatically, but if you are upgrading you will need to manually set the following before restarting Sentry.

In `relay/config.yml` ([example](https://github.com/getsentry/onpremise/blob/master/relay/config.example.yml)):

```yaml
processing:
  geoip_path: "/geoip/GeoLite2-City.mmdb"
```

In `sentry/sentry.conf.py` ([example](https://github.com/getsentry/onpremise/blob/master/sentry/sentry.conf.example.py)):

```py
GEOIP_PATH_MMDB = '/geoip/GeoLite2-City.mmdb'
```
