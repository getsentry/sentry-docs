Self-hosted Sentry follows a monthly release schedule using the [CalVer](https://calver.org/#scheme) versioning scheme. A new version is released on the [15th of each month](https://github.com/getsentry/onpremise/blob/704e4c3b5b7360080f79bcfbe26583e5a95ae675/.github/workflows/release.yml#L20-L24), and patch releases are done when needed in-between. You can find the [latest release](https://github.com/getsentry/onpremise/releases/latest) over at the [releases section of our onpremise repository](https://github.com/getsentry/onpremise/releases/).

<Alert title="Why CalVer?" level="info">
  In short, this is to keep the self-hosted Sentry as close to the live version
  hosted at <Link to="https://sentry.io">sentry.io</Link>. There are more details for the
  curious over at our <Link to="https://blog.sentry.io/2020/06/22/self-hosted-sentry-switching-to-calver">blog post announcing the switch</Link>.

## Upgrading

We strongly recommend upgrading by going through all the versions between your current version and the target version you are upgrading to. That means if you are on version `20.6.0` and want to upgrade to `20.8.0`, the recommendation is for you to upgrade to `20.7.0` first and then upgrade to `20.8.0`. Skipping versions *may* work, but there will be times that Sentry requires specific a version to be installed first, to ensure essential data migrations before moving forward.

Upgrading is as simple as downloading the latest version of the onpremise repository and running `./install.sh` there. See the <Link to="/self-hosted/">main page for self-hosted Sentry</Link> if you need more information about upgrades and configuration.

## Nightly Builds

We provide nightly builds from the [master branch of the onpremise repository](https://github.com/getsentry/onpremise/) for each new commit for [Sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry), and all of the supporting projects:

- [Snuba](https://github.com/getsentry/snuba)
- [Relay](https://github.com/getsentry/relay)
- [Symbolicator](https://github.com/getsentry/symbolicator)

These builds are usually stable, but you may occasionally hit a broken version as these versions are not guaranteed to be deployed to [sentry.io](http://sentry.io/) first. There is also no guarantee that you will be able to do a clean upgrade to later versions without losing any data. **Use the nightly builds at your own risk.**
