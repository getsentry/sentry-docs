![CalVer: YY.MM.MICRO](https://img.shields.io/badge/calver-YY.MM.MICRO-ad6caa.svg)

Sentry cuts regular releases for self-hosting to keep it as close to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) as possible. We decided to follow a monthly release schedule using the [CalVer](https://calver.org/#scheme) versioning scheme, with a primary release on the [15th of each month](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/blob/704e4c3b5b7360080f79bcfbe26583e5a95ae675/.github/workflows/release.yml#L20-L24). We don't patch old versions, but if a bug is bad enough we may cut an out-of-cycle point release, which, like our regular monthly releases, is a snapshot of the latest versions of all of our components. You can find the [latest release](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/releases/latest) over at the [releases section of our self-hosted repository](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/releases/).

<Alert title="Why CalVer?" level="info">
  In short, this is to keep the self-hosted Sentry as close to the live version
  hosted at <Link to="https://sentry.io">sentry.io</Link>. There are more details for the
  curious over at our <Link to="https://blog.sentry.io/2020/06/22/self-hosted-sentry-switching-to-calver">blog post announcing the switch</Link>.

<Alert title="Warning" level="warning">
  CalVer is optimized for continuous deployment, <em>not</em> long-term stability. We recommend that you upgrade regularly, as we do in <Link to="https://sentry.io/pricing/">our SaaS environment</Link>.

## Upgrading

We encourage everyone to regularly update their Sentry installations to get the best and the most recent Sentry experience.

To upgrade, all you need to do is download or check out the version of self-hosted repository you want, replace your existing folder's contents with that, and then run `./install.sh`.

<Alert title="Configuration Updates" level="info">
We may have some updated configuration, especially for new features, so always check the example config files under the <Link to="https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/blob/master/sentry/">sentry directory</Link> and see if you need to update your existing configuration. We do our best to automate critical configuration updates, but you should always check your configs during upgrades.
</Alert>

Before starting the upgrade, we shut down all the services and then run some data migrations, so expect to have some downtime. There is an *experimental* `--minimize-downtime` option to reduce the downtime during upgrades. Use this at your own risk and see [the pull request it was implemented in](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/issues/607) for more information.

<Alert title="Warning" level="warning">
  There are certain hard-stops you need to go through when upgrading from earlier versions. Please read the <Link to="#hard-stops">hard-stops</Link> section below for a list.
</Alert>

### Hard Stops

We have three hards stops that you need to go through in order to pick up significant database changes:

1. If you are coming from a version prior to `9.1.2`, you first need to upgrade to `9.1.2` and follow the next steps:
   ```
   <your.sentry.version> -> 9.1.2 -> 21.5.0 -> 21.6.3 -> 23.6.2 -> latest
   ```
1. If you are coming from `9.1.2`, you first need to upgrade to `21.5.0` and follow the next steps:
   ```
   <your.sentry.version> -> 21.5.0 -> 21.6.3 -> 23.6.2 -> latest
   ```
1. If you are coming from a version prior to `21.6.3`, you first need to upgrade to `21.6.3`:
   ```
   <your.sentry.version> -> 21.6.3 -> 23.6.2 -> latest
   ```
1. If you are coming from a version prior to `23.6.2`, you first need to upgrade to `23.6.2`:
  ```
   <your.sentry.version> -> 23.6.2 -> latest
   ```

Any other case (`23.6.2+`), you should be able to upgrade to the latest version directly. We'd recommend you skip `23.7.0` to avoid issues around database migrations and the django 3 upgrade.

## Nightly Builds

We provide nightly builds from the [master branch of the self-hosted repository](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/) for each new commit for [Sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry), and all of the supporting projects:

- [Snuba](https://github.com/getsentry/snuba)
- [Relay](https://github.com/getsentry/relay)
- [Symbolicator](https://github.com/getsentry/symbolicator)

These builds are usually stable, but you may occasionally hit a broken version as these versions are not guaranteed to be deployed to [sentry.io](http://sentry.io/) first. There is also no guarantee that you will be able to do a clean upgrade to later versions without losing any data. **Use the nightly builds at your own risk.**
