Sentry cuts regular releases for self-hosting to keep it as close to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) as possible. We decided to follow a monthly release schedule using the [CalVer](https://calver.org/#scheme) versioning scheme, with a primary release on the [15th of each month](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/blob/704e4c3b5b7360080f79bcfbe26583e5a95ae675/.github/workflows/release.yml#L20-L24). We don't patch old versions, but if a bug is bad enough we may cut an out-of-cycle point release, which, like our regular monthly releases, is a snapshot of the latest versions of all of our components. You can find the [latest release](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/releases/latest) over at the [releases section of our self-hosted repository](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/releases/).

<Alert title="Why CalVer?" level="info">
  In short, this is to keep the self-hosted Sentry as close to the live version
  hosted at <Link to="https://sentry.io">sentry.io</Link>. There are more details for the
  curious over at our <Link to="https://blog.sentry.io/2020/06/22/self-hosted-sentry-switching-to-calver">blog post announcing the switch</Link>.
</Alert>

<Alert title="Warning" level="warning">
  CalVer is optimized for continuous deployment, <em>not</em> long-term stability. We recommend that you upgrade regularly, as we do in <Link to="https://sentry.io/pricing/">our SaaS environment</Link>.

## Upgrading

We encourage everyone to regularly update their Sentry installations to get the best and the most recent Sentry experience.

Before starting the upgrade, we shut down all the services and then run some data migrations, so expect to have some downtime. There is an *experimental* `--minimize-downtime` option to reduce the downtime during upgrades. Use this at your own risk and see [the pull request it was implemented in](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/issues/607) for more information.

We assume you've cloned the self-hosted repository, so checkout the version you want to upgrade to (23.11.0 as an example).

```bash
git fetch
git checkout 23.11.0
```

<Alert title="Warning" level="warning">
  If you upgrade infrequently, it's less likely that upgrading to the latest version will work.
  Please refer to <Link to="#hard-stops">Hard Stops</Link> for how to incrementally upgrade to more recent versions.
</Alert>

We may have some updated configuration, especially for new features, so always check the example config files under the <Link to="https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/blob/master/sentry/">sentry directory</Link> and see if you need to update your existing configuration. We do our best to automate critical configuration updates, but you should always check your configs during upgrades.

Finally, to upgrade, just run `./install.sh`.


### Hard Stops

When upgrading one must upgrade to **each** hard stop to pick up significant database changes.

These are the hard stops that one needs to go through:

- 9.1.2
- 21.5.0
- 21.6.3
- 23.6.2
- 23.11.0
- 24.8.0

Versions to avoid upgrading to:
- `23.7.0` (issues around database migrations and the Django 3 upgrade)

As an example if one wants to go from `22.8.0` to `24.2.0` one needs the following upgrade path:

```
# example
(initial: 22.8.0) -> 23.6.2 -> 23.11.0 -> 24.2.0
```

## Nightly Builds

We provide nightly builds from the [master branch of the self-hosted repository](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/) for each new commit for [Sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry), and all of the supporting projects:

- [Snuba](https://github.com/getsentry/snuba)
- [Relay](https://github.com/getsentry/relay)
- [Symbolicator](https://github.com/getsentry/symbolicator)
- [Vroom](https://github.com/getsentry/vroom)

These builds are usually stable, but you may occasionally hit a broken version as these versions are not guaranteed to be deployed to [sentry.io](http://sentry.io/) first. There is also no guarantee that you will be able to do a clean upgrade to later versions without losing any data. **Use the nightly builds at your own risk.**

## Breaking Changes

- The `23.11.0` release will remove the ``sentry run smtp`` worker process. This
  worker was not part of the standard self-hosted configuration, but could be
  used in custom deployments.

- The `24.1.2` release will change the memcached backend from
  `django.core.cache.backends.memcached.MemcachedCache` to
  `django.core.cache.backends.memcached.PyMemcacheCache`. This will require changing the `CACHES`
  setting in your `sentry.conf.py` file in a manner similar to what is seen
  [here](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/commit/9936376f4e933781feaae85e0071ef72c7f1c03f).
  In particular, the `OPTIONS` API for `PyMemcacheCache` is different from that of
  `MemcachedCache`, and may require changes depending on how it has been configured.
