<Alert title="Important" level="warning">
    These are community-contributed docs. Sentry does not officially provide support for self-hosted configurations beyond the default install.
</Alert>

This page is considered experimental because everyone will have different setup and requirements for their monitoring system. It is also best to use your existing monitoring system, and try to integrate Sentry with it, instead of spinning up a new one.

Most containers have a `statsd` client that you can point to your monitoring system. If you have a native `statsd` server instance, you can directly use it. If you don't, you might want to add some kind of converter that converts the ingested `statsd` format into your own. For example, if you are using Prometheus, you can use [prometheus-statsd-exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/statsd_exporter) to bridge the gap.

If you are using DataDog as your monitoring system, it is recommended to use [DogStatsD](https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/dogstatsd/?tab=hostagent) as the collector.

We recommend [the original `statsd` server made by Etsy](https://github.com/statsd/statsd) or the others on the [server re-implementations](https://github.com/statsd/statsd/blob/master/docs/server_implementations.md).

Other than service monitoring, you should also monitor your own host instance by using [Prometheus Node Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter), and your Docker daemon by using [built-in Prometheus exporter](https://docs.docker.com/engine/daemon/prometheus/) or similar tools. Sentry does not provide any alerts if your host instance is low on resources such as free memory or disk space. It is critical for you to monitor the disk space as once it gets full, it will be much harder to recover from there.

<Alert title="Note">
    After changing configuration files, don't forget to restart the containers with `docker compose restart`. See the <Link to="/self-hosted/#configuration">configuration section</Link> for more information.

## Sentry-related configurations

This documentation assumes `100.100.123.123` as your statsd host IP address. On most services, it is recommended to provide an IP address for the host like this, instead of a domain name like `statsd.yourcompany.com`.

### Sentry

You can configure Sentry to send metrics to Statsd server by configuring your `sentry/sentry.conf.py` file:

```python
SENTRY_METRICS_BACKEND = 'sentry.metrics.statsd.StatsdMetricsBackend'
SENTRY_METRICS_OPTIONS: dict[str, Any] = {
    'host': '100.100.123.123', # It's recommended to use IP address instead of domain name
    'port': 8125,
}
# SENTRY_METRICS_SAMPLE_RATE = 1.0   # Adjust this to your needs, default is 1.0
# SENTRY_METRICS_PREFIX = "sentry."  # Adjust this to your needs, default is "sentry."
```

### Snuba

You can configure Snuba to send metrics to Statsd server by configuring your `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
# The rest of your Docker Compose file

x-snuba-defaults: &snuba_defaults
  <<: *restart_policy
  depends_on:
    clickhouse:
      <<: *depends_on-healthy
    kafka:
      <<: *depends_on-healthy
    redis:
      <<: *depends_on-healthy
  image: "$SNUBA_IMAGE"
  environment:
    SNUBA_SETTINGS: self_hosted
    CLICKHOUSE_HOST: clickhouse
    DEFAULT_BROKERS: "kafka:9092"
    REDIS_HOST: redis
    UWSGI_MAX_REQUESTS: "10000"
    UWSGI_DISABLE_LOGGING: "true"
    # Leaving the value empty to just pass whatever is set
    # on the host system (or in the .env file)
    SENTRY_EVENT_RETENTION_DAYS:
    SNUBA_STATSD_HOST: "100.100.123.123" # Must be an IP address, not domain name
    SNUBA_STATSD_PORT: 8125

# The rest of your Docker Compose file
```

### Relay

You can configure Relay to send metrics to Statsd server by configuring your `relay/config.yml` file:

```yaml
# The rest of your config.yml file
metrics:
  statsd: "100.100.123.123:8125" # It's recommended to use IP address instead of domain name
  # prefix: "sentry.relay" # Adjust this to your needs, default is "sentry.relay"
  # sample_rate: 1.0 # Adjust this to your needs, default is 1.0
  # `periodic_secs` is the interval for periodic metrics emitted from Relay.
  # Setting it to `0` seconds disables the periodic metrics.
  # periodic_secs: 5
```

### Symbolicator

You can configure Symbolicator to send metrics to Statsd server by configuring your `symbolicator/config.yml` file:

```yaml
# The rest of your config.yml file
metrics:
  statsd: "100.100.123.123:8125" # It's recommended to use IP address instead of domain name
  prefix: "sentry.symbolicator" # Adjust this to your needs, default is "symbolicator"
```

## Sentry dependencies

Sentry and its' surrounding services have some dependencies like Redis, ClickHouse, Kafka, etc, that you can monitor with your monitoring system. The easiest way to do so is through Prometheus exporters. Although there are many exporters available, for reference purposes, you can use this setup below.

Modify your `docker-compose.yml` file to add the following:

```yaml
services:
  # The rest of your Docker Compose file
  prometheus-postgresql-exporter:
    <<: *restart_policy
    image: quay.io/prometheuscommunity/postgres-exporter
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:9187:9187"
    environment:
      DATA_SOURCE_URI: "postgres:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable"
      DATA_SOURCE_USER: "postgres"
  prometheus-redis-exporter:
    <<: *restart_policy
    image: oliver006/redis_exporter
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:9121:9121"
    environment:
      REDIS_ADDR: "redis:6379"
  prometheus-kafka-exporter:
    <<: *restart_policy
    image: danielqsj/kafka-exporter
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:9308:9308"
    command: ["--kafka.server=kafka:9092"]
  prometheus-memcached-exporter:
    <<: *restart_policy
    image: quay.io/prometheus/memcached-exporter
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:9150:9150"
    command: ["--memcached.address=memcached:11211"]
```

Modify your `clickhouse/config.xml` file to add the following:

```xml
<clickhouse>
    <!-- The rest of your ClickHouse configuration -->
    <prometheus>
        <endpoint>/metrics</endpoint>
        <port>9363</port>
        <metrics>true</metrics>
        <events>true</events>
        <asynchronous_metrics>true</asynchronous_metrics>
        <errors>true</errors>
    </prometheus>
</clickhouse>
```

Up to this point, all metrics are exposed only on `localhost`. If you don't want your Sentry installation to expose any other ports, you can remove every `ports` directive on the `docker-compose.yml` file and route everything through the `nginx` container, by modifying your `nginx.conf` file to the following:

```nginx
# The rest of your Nginx configuration
http {
    # The rest of your HTTP configuration
    server {
      # The rest of your server configuration
      location = /_metrics/postgresql {
        proxy_pass http://prometheus-postgresql-exporter:9187;
      }

      location = /_metrics/redis {
        proxy_pass http://prometheus-redis-exporter:9121;
      }

      location = /_metrics/kafka {
        proxy_pass http://prometheus-kafka-exporter:9308;
      }

      location = /_metrics/memcached {
        proxy_pass http://prometheus-memcached-exporter:9150;
      }

      location = /_metrics/clickhouse {
        proxy_pass http://clickhouse:9363;
    }
}
```
