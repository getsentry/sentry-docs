description: Learn about the data flow of self-hosted Sentry

This diagram shows the data flow of self-hosted Sentry. It is similar with [Application Architecture](/application-architecture/overview/) but we are focusing more on the self-hosted components.

  end
```

### Event Ingestion Pipeline

1. Events from the SDK is sent to the `relay` service.
2. Relay parses the incoming envelope, validates whether the DSN and Project ID are valid. It reads project config data from `redis`.
3. Relay builds a new payload to be consumed by Sentry ingest consumers, and sends it to `kafka`.
4. Sentry `ingest-*` consumers ( with `*` [wildcard] being the event type [errors, transaction, profiles, etc]) consumes the event, caches it in `redis` and starts the `preprocess_event` task.
5. The `preprocess_event` task symbolicates stack traces with `symbolicator` service, and processes the event according to its event type.
6. The `preprocess_event` task saves the event payload to nodestore (default nodestore backend is `postgres`).
7. The `preprocess_event` task publishes the event to `kafka` under the `events` topic.

### Event Processing Pipeline

1. The `snuba-consumer` service consumes events from `events` topic and processes them. After the events are written to clickhouse, snuba publishes error & transaction events to `post-process-forwarder`.
2. The Sentry `post-process-forwarder` consumer consumes messages and spawns a `post_process_group` task for each processed error & issue occurance.

### Web User Interface

1. The `web` service is what you see, it's the Django web UI and API that serves the Sentry's frontend.
2. The `worker` service mainly consumes tasks from  `redis` that acts as a celery queue. One notable task is to send emails through the SMTP server.
