In some cases, storing Sentry data on-disk is not really something people can do. Sometimes, it's better to offload it into some bucket storage (like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage).

<Alert title="Note" level="info">
    After changing configuration files, re-run the <code>./install.sh</code> script, to rebuild and restart the containers. See the <Link to="/self-hosted/#configuration">configuration section</Link> for more information.

## Sentry

Sentry has an abstraction called "filestore" that handles storing attachments, sourcemaps (release artifacts), and replays. Filestore configuration for Sentry should be configured on the `sentry/config.yml` file.

### Google Cloud Storage backend

The configuration for GCS backend is pointed to `sentry.filestore.gcs.GoogleCloudStorage`. You will need to set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable. For more information, refer to the [Google Cloud documentation for setting up authentication](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/reference/libraries#setting_up_authentication).

```yaml
filestore.backend: "gcs"
filestore.options:
  bucket_name: "..."
```

### S3 backend

<Alert title="Warning" level="warning">
  Although S3 support is available, it is not thoroughly tested and is not used by Sentry SaaS internally. Therefore, it is experiemental and not officially supported. 
</Alert>

The configuration for S3-compatible backend is pointed to `sentry.filestore.s3.S3Boto3Storage`.

```yaml
filestore.backend: 's3'
filestore.options:
  bucket_acl: 'private'
  default_acl: 'private'
  access_key: '<REDACTED>'
  secret_key: '<REDACTED>'
  bucket_name: 'my-bucket'
  region_name: 'auto'
  endpoint_url: 'https://<REDACTED>' # If you're not using AWS.
  addressing_style: 'path' # For regular AWS S3, use "auto" or "virtual". For other S3-compatible API like MinIO or Ceph, use "path".
  signature_version: 's3v4'
```

Refer to [botocore configuration](https://botocore.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/config.html) for valid configuration values.

## Vroom

Vroom is the service that handles profiling. By default the data for profiling is saved on the local filesystem. On self-hosted deployments, this should be done by overriding the `SENTRY_BUCKET_PROFILES` environment variable. It's also possible that additional environment variables should be added, depending on the backend of choice.

### Google Cloud Storage backend

You will need to set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable. For more information, refer to the [Google Cloud documentation for setting up authentication](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/reference/libraries#setting_up_authentication).

```bash
gs://my-bucket
```

### S3 backend

<Alert title="Note" level="warning">
  Although S3 support is available, it is not thoroughly tested and is not used by Sentry SaaS internally. Therefore, it is experiemental and not officially supported. 
</Alert>

```bash
# For regular AWS S3
s3://my-bucket?awssdk=v1&region=us-west-1&endpoint=amazonaws.com

# For other S3-compatible APIs
s3://my-bucket?awssdk=v1&region=any-region&endpoint=minio.yourcompany.com&s3ForcePathStyle=true&disableSSL
```

Additional environment variables should be provided:
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY=foobar`
- `AWS_SECRET_KEY=foobar`
- `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=foobar` (optional)

Further explanation on the query string options:
- `region`: The AWS region for requests.
- `endpoint`: The endpoint URL (hostname only or fully qualified URI).
- `disableSSL`: A value of "true" disables SSL when sending requests.
- `s3ForcePathStyle`: A value of "true" forces the request to use path-style addressing.
