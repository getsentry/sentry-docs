## Quick Backup

If you need a quick way to backup and restore your Sentry instance and you don't need historical event data, you can use the built in `export` and `import` commands. These commands will save and load all project and user data, but will not contain any event data.

### Backup

```shell
docker-compose run --rm -T -e SENTRY_LOG_LEVEL=CRITICAL web export > sentry/backup.json
```

<Alert title="Note" level="info"><markdown>
If you omit the `-T` or `-e SENTRY_LOG_LEVEL=CRITICAL` parts, your backup file will have logging lines mixed in and you'll have to remove them somehow.
</markdown></Alert>

### Restore

Once you have a backup by using the `export` command, the easiest way to restore it is to place it under the `sentry` directory in your main `onpremise` repo, next to the config files. This directory automatically gets mounted to `/etc/sentry` so you can run the following to restore your backup:

```shell
docker-compose run --rm -T web import /etc/sentry/backup.json
```

If you don't see any errors and the process exits with code `0`, congratulations, you have just restored your backup.

<Alert level="warning">
We strongly recommended that you restore your backup on the <strong>same version of Sentry</strong> on a fresh install (empty database but migrations are run). Otherwise, you are very likely to hit errors and may corrupt your database.
</Alert>

## Full Backup

The ideal way to backup and restore Sentry is to backup and restore all Docker volumes that it uses. All volumes that hold critical long-term data are already defined as global volumes at install time and are prefixed with `sentry-`:

- `sentry-data`
- `sentry-postgres`
- `sentry-redis`
- `sentry-zookeeper`
- `sentry-kafka`
- `sentry-clickhouse`
- `sentry-symbolicator`

<Alert title="Note" level="info">
Only backing up and restoring these volumes should bring back all persisted data. If you also need to back up in-flight data, we recommend backing up any project-specific volumes that <code>docker-compose</code> automatically creates, typically with the <code>sentry_onpremise_sentry-</code> prefix.
</Alert>

Docker documents [how to backup and restore volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/#backup-restore-or-migrate-data-volumes) on their documentation. You may use different methods as long as the volumes can be read back without issues.
