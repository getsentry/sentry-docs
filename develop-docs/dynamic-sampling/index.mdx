title: Dynamic Sampling
---

Dynamic Sampling is a feature of the ingestion pipeline that allows Sentry to automatically **adjust the amount of data retained** based on the value of the data. From all the data received by the SDKs, Sentry is able to extract low-granularity information through metrics, while Dynamic Sampling makes the decision of whether to keep or drop data.

The goals of Dynamic Sampling are:
- **Value at any scale**: Sentry has a full view of your application and can accurately show performance metrics, detect trends and performance issues from 100% of your events.
- **Get value out of the box**: Sentry automatically biases data retention in order to store sufficient samples of the highest value events in full detail.
- **Prioritize based on your needs**: Sentry provides a mechanism to express priorities as a set of rules and then adjusts data retention as much as is practical to honor them.
