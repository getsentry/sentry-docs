---

The `sentry-cli` tool can be used to view and stream logs from your Sentry projects. This allows you to monitor your application logs directly from the command line.

## Requirements

To use the logs command, you need to:

- [Install](/cli/installation) the Sentry CLI
- [Authenticate](/cli/configuration) with Sentry using an auth token
- Have logs enabled for your project

## Configuration

The logs command uses your Sentry auth token for authentication. You can configure this using:

```bash
sentry-cli login
```

Or by setting the `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable:

```bash
export SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=___ORG_AUTH_TOKEN___
```

Learn more about the CLI's [configuration file](/cli/configuration#configuration-file).

## Basic Usage

The logs command supports two main operations: listing logs and streaming logs in real-time.

### List Logs

To fetch and display logs:

```bash
sentry-cli logs list --project=my-project --org=my-org
```

### Stream Logs

To continuously stream logs in real-time:

```bash
sentry-cli logs list --project=my-project --org=my-org --live
```

The live streaming mode will continuously poll for new logs and display them as they arrive.

## Command Options

### Project and Organization

Specify the project and organization explicitly:

```bash
sentry-cli logs list --project=my-project --org=my-org
```

Or use the default values from your configuration file.

## Examples

### Monitor Application Logs

Stream logs from your production application:

```bash
sentry-cli logs list --project=my-app --org=my-org --live
```

### View Recent Logs

Fetch and display logs from your project:

```bash
sentry-cli logs list --project=my-app --org=my-org
```

## Output Format

The logs command displays log entries with the following information:

- Timestamp
- Log level
- Message
- Trace ID (if present)

Log entries are displayed in a readable format, making it easy to monitor your application's logging output directly from the command line.
