Metrics help you track and visualize the data points you care about, making it easier to monitor your application's health and identify issues.
Learn more about [Metrics](/product/explore/metrics).

## Requirements
- [Install](/product/cli/installation) the Sentry CLI (min v2.32.0).

## Configuration

The Sentry CLI uses your project's DSN to authorize sending metrics. To set it up, export the `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable:

```bash
export SENTRY_DSN=___PUBLIC_DSN___
```

Alternatively, you can add it to your `~/.sentryclirc` config file:

```ini {filename:~/.sentryclirc}
[auth]
dsn = ___PUBLIC_DSN___
```

## Sending metrics
You can send metrics using the CLI's `send-metric` command. You need to provide at least the `--name` or `-n` parameter to identify the metric.
When emitting a metric that doesn't exist, the metric will be created for you. If it already exists, it will be updated.
All metric types support custom units and tags provided with the `-u` and `-t` parameters respectively:

```bash
sentry-cli send-metric increment -n "MyMetric" -u "MyUnit" -t "tag1:val1","tag2:val2"
```

The metric's name, unit, and tags will undergo normalization to only include supported characters.
Learn more about [Limits and Restrictions](/product/explore/metrics/#limits-and-restrictions).

### Counters
To increment a counter metric by one, you only need to provide the `--name` or `-n` parameter.
A counter metric can also be incremented by a custom value using the `-v` parameter:

```bash
sentry-cli send-metric increment -n "button_click" -v 2
```

### Gauges
To emit a gauge metric, you always need to provide the name and value:

```bash
sentry-cli send-metric gauge -n "bundle_size" -v 384 -u "byte"
```

### Distributions
Similar to gauges, you need to provide the name and value to emit a distribution metric:

```bash
sentry-cli send-metric distribution -n "build_time" -v 120 -u "millisecond"
```

### Sets
To emit a set metric, you need to provide the name and value where the value can be any number or string:

```bash
sentry-cli send-metric set -n "build_platform" -v "android"
```
