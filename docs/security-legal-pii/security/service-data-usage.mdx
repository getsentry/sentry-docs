## Delivering a Better User Experience

Sentry processes your service data, the data you configure to be collected and reported to your Sentry instance, to provide our service to you. As Sentry's service has evolved, however, prior heuristics-based approaches cannot deliver the product value we've come to expect. To train and validate models for grouping, notifications, and workflow improvements, Sentry will need access to additional [service data](https://blog.sentry.io/terms-of-service-update/) to deliver a better user experience.

You can update these settings within the “Service Data Usage” section of the [Legal & Compliance page in Sentry](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/settings/legal/), which is located within the “Usage & Billing” Settings.

### Use of Non-Identifying Data

In accordance with our Terms of Service, Sentry may use non-identifying elements of your service data for product improvement. For example, we may aggregate web vitals data to show your site's performance against a Sentry-built benchmark. The data accessed for the benchmark cannot be linked back to any particular project or customer, making it non-identifying.

### Use of Aggregated Identifying Data

With your authorization, Sentry may use certain types of service data to improve our product. These include:

- Error messages
- Stack traces
- Spans
- DOM interactions

## Use of Identifying Data for Generative AI Features

For generative AI features like [Seer](/product/ai-in-sentry/seer/) or issue summary, Sentry may access your service data to provide feature functionalities to you, including generative AI output. By default, your data will not be used to train any generative AI models without your permission. AI-generated output from your data is shown only to you, not other customers. For more details about Sentry, AI, and privacy, see our [AI Privacy Principles](/product/ai-in-sentry/ai-privacy-and-security/).

## Data Access Summary

\*_In these cases we don't share the underlying data, only aggregations or output generated from the data_

## Our Data Handling

Where we are authorized to use service data for product improvement:

1. We'll continue to encourage all customers to use our [various data scrubbing tools](/security-legal-pii/scrubbing/) so that service data is sanitized before we receive it.

2. We'll apply the same deletion and retention rules to our training data as we do to the underlying service data. This means that if you delete service data, it will also be removed from our machine learning models automatically.

3. We'll scrub data for PII before it goes into any training set.

We're confident that with these controls in place, we'll be able to use service data to improve and provide our products while at the same time protecting that data.
