## Overview

Sentry retains different types of data for varying periods based on your plan tier and the specific data type. The below table outlines the retention periods for data types across our Developer, Team, Business, and Enterprise plans.

By default, new account trials have Team plan retention. If you are trialing from a paid plan type, you will have the same retention as that plan for any data ingested during the trial.

## Default Data Retention by Plan

| Data Type | Developer | Team | Business / Enterprise |
|-----------|-----------|------|----------|
| Errors | 30 days | 90 days | 90 days |
| Logs | 30 days | 30 days | 30 days |
| Spans/Transactions | 30 days | 30 days* | 30 days + 13 months sampled* |
| Session Replays | 30 days | 90 days | 90 days |
| Profiles | 30 days | 30 days | 30 days |
| Crons | 30 days | 30 days | 30 days |
| Uptime | 30 days | 90 days | 90 days |
| Attachments | 30 days | 90 days | 90 days |

**Exception\*:** If you are on a[Team or Business plan](https://sentry.io/settings/billing/overview/) that uses [transaction-based billing](https://docs.sentry.io/pricing/), transactions retention will be 90 days and sampled retention of spans data will not apply.

## Sampled Retention for Business and Enterprise Plans

Business and Enterprise plan customers receive extended retention for spans data through our sampled retention feature. This provides up to:

- **Full fidelity data**: 30 days of complete span data
- **Sampled data**: 13 months of downsampled span data

13 month downsampled data is a percentage of span data. Sampled retention is currently only available for span data.

## Data Retention Details

### When Retention is Applied

Retention periods are set at the time data is ingested, based on the then-current plan. This means plan upgrades or downgrades affect retention for new data only; existing data retains its original retention period.

## Extended Retention

When data reaches the end of its retention period, it can no longer be accessed. If you need to retain data beyond the standard retention period, consider:

- Upgrading to a plan with longer retention
- Contacting support for enterprise retention options

Reference our [security policy](https://sentry.io/security/) for information about data deletion.
