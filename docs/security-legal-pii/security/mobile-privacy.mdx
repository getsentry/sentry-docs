## General

### What data does Sentry collect from users of my app?

Sentry collects only the data that you configure to be sent to Sentry. This is typically the occurrence of software bugs (Errors) or API calls, page loads, or similar requests and responses from your apps (Transactions).

### Does that data include any personally identifiable information (PII)?

By default, Sentry uses randomly generated IDs as [described below](#does-sentry-use-the-device-id-to-identify-a-user). You can also augment data sent to Sentry with additional context and meta data, including user names, email addresses, or by attaching files such as logs or crash reports. This data, alone or in combination with other data, may constitute PII if it identifies, directly or indirectly, an individual.

### Does Sentry use the device ID to identify a user?

No. Sentry on Mobile doesn't use device ID such as `Secure.ANDROID_ID` and `advertisingIdentifier` on iOS. Instead, it uses IDs which are randomly generated per device, per app, and per installation, and therefore can't be used to identify a single device across application installations. When an application is reinstalled, a new ID is generated. Since these IDs are solely used to provide approximate statistical information as part of the application monitoring service, it serves that purpose. It's required, for example, for [Crash Free Session and User Rates](/product/releases/health/#crash-free-sessionsusers), as well as to indicate the [impact of issues based on number of events vs affected users](https://docs.sentry.io/product/issues/issue-details/#trends--aggregates).

### What does Sentry do with the data it collects?

Sentry processes the data you send to it to provide our application monitoring service to you.

## Apple App Store

### Do I need to disclose the use of Sentry in App Store Connect on the Apple App Store?

Yes, Sentry is a third-party partner whose code (SDKs) you integrate in your app that collects data from users of your app.

### What do I need to disclose to Apple?

You would need to disclose all types of data you are collecting through your app, including data you are sending to Sentry. In the example above, this could include “Contact Info” or “Identifiers”, but don't forget to include any other categories of data that you are collecting or have configured the SDKs to send to Sentry.

### How does Sentry use my data?

The standard data use cases for Sentry would be “Analytics” and “AppFunctionality”, but you would also need to disclose to Apple any other ways in which you or your app use data you are collecting.

### Does Sentry use my data to track users?

Sentry does not use your data to track users. However, if you or your other third-party partners are tracking users, you would still need to disclose this to Apple.

### Does Sentry use the Advertising Identifier (IDFA)?

No. Sentry doesn't require [`IDFA`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identifier_for_Advertisers).

## Google Play

### Does Sentry collect any PII from children?

If your app is targeted to children and you configure Sentry to collect PII, then Sentry would collect the elements that you’ve designated. You would remain responsible for obtaining any appropriate parental consents with respect to the PII you collect from your users and subsequently send to Sentry. You would also remain responsible for declaring your app’s target age group to Google Play.

### Do Sentry SDKs cause my app to contain ads?

No. Sentry does not cause your app to contain any ads.

### What do I need to disclose to Google Play?

You would need to disclose and/or include in your app privacy policy all types of data you are collecting through your app, including data you are sending to Sentry.
