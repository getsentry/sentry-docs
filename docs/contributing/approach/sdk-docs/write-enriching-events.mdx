title: How to Write - Enriching Events

The Enriching Events section of the content covers how customers can add context to the data sent to Sentry. A new framework can adopt the common content, which is stored in `/docs/platforms/<SDK>/common/enriching-events` - feel free to peruse the files in that directory to answer any questions.

<Alert >

Don't change the common content. That change will ripple across all guides that rely on the common content. Instead, open an issue on GitHub with questions/suggestions.

</Alert >

Most of these pages are pretty self-evident, so only basic information is provided. But please ask questions by opening an issue on GitHub.

## Start Here

Determine if the page applies:

- If the content _does not apply_, add the guide to `notSupported` list in the frontmatter of the file. This will turn off the display of the content for this guide.
- If the content _does apply_, add the `include` file to the correct directory as noted for each page. If the code sample is not provided, the page will display a big gray box requesting customers open an issue for the missing sample.
- The JS family of content needs to import the SDK for the code samples to make sense on each page. Add the import statement to `/src/platform-includes/enriching-events/enriching-events/import`.

### Add Context

This file is `context.mdx`. It explains how to enable custom contexts. Add the code sample to this directory:

- `/src/platform-includes/enriching-events/set-context/`

If the guide can pass context directly, add it to the list of supported guides immediately above "Passing Context Directly".

### Identify Users

This file is `identify-user.mdx`. It explains how to capture the user. Add the code samples to these directories:

- `/src/platform-includes/enriching-events/set-user/`
- `/src/platform-includes/enriching-events/unset-user/`

### Set Transaction Name

This file is `transaction-name.mdx`. It explains how to override the transaction name. Add the code sample to this directory:

- `/src/platform-includes/enriching-events/set-transaction-name/`

If the guide can control the starting and stopping of transactions, add it to the list of supported guides that refers customers to our tracing docs.

### Customize Tags

This file is `tags.mdx`. It explains how to customize tags for an event. Add the code sample to this directory:

- `/src/platform-includes/enriching-events/set-tag/`

If the guide doesn't bind tags to the current scope, add it to the list of guides that don't support this option.

### Attachments

This file is `/attachments/index.mdx`. It explains attaching files along with the event. Add the code sample to this directory:

- `/src/platform-includes/enriching-events/add-attachment/`

If the guide is part of the native family, add it to the list of guides that support the native content regarding:

- Debug information files and built-in support for native crashes
- Large crash reports
- The section on "Crash Reports and Privacy"
- The paragraph regarding limiting crash reports per issue

### Breadcrumbs

This file is `breadcrumbs.mdx`. It explains manual breadcrumbs. Add the code sample to manually add record a breadcrumb to this directory:

- `/src/platform-includes/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/breadcrumbs-example/`
- `/src/platform-includes/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/before-breadcrumb/`

One nuance:

- Update, as appropriate, the supported guide list in the `PlatformSection supported` that precedes "The available breadcrumb keys..."

### User Feedback

This file is `user-feedback.mdx`. It explains how to use the embeddable JS widget or the API.

- Update, as appropriate, the supported SDK list in the `PlatformSection supported` that precedes "User Feedback API".
  Then add the code sample to the `src/platform-includes/user-feedback/sdk-api-example` directory
- For the .NET family, if the User Feedback API has a specific integration, add it to the `PlatformSection supported` that precedes the "Use the .NET SDK", and add the appropriate link.
- Update, as appropriate, the SDKs that don't support the JS widget in the listed `PlatformSection notSupported` that precedes "Embeddeable JavaScript Widget".
- For the SDKs that use the JS widget, add the code sample to`/src/platform-includes/user-feedback/user-feedback-example-widget/`

### Scopes

This file is `scopes.mdx`. It explains managing scopes. Add the code samples to these directories:

- `/src/platform-includes/enriching-events/scopes/configure-scope/`
- `/src/platform-includes/enriching-events/unset-user/`
- `/src/platform-includes/enriching-events/scopes/with-scope/`
