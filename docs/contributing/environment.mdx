This setup assumes you have [Yarn][Yarn], [Volta][volta] and [pre-commit][pre-commit] installed.

If you prefer not to use Volta, make sure you're using Node 20.

First, open a terminal and clone the `sentry-docs` repo:

```bash
# Clone the docs repo
git clone git@github.com:getsentry/sentry-docs.git
```

Next, navigate into the cloned repo and run the following to install dependencies:

```bash
# Install or update application dependencies
make
```

Now, run the development webserver (depending on the docs you want to run):

```bash
# Start dev server for user docs
yarn dev

# Start dev server for developer docs
yarn dev:developer-docs
```

You will now be able to access docs via http://localhost:3000.

[volta]: https://volta.sh/
[pre-commit]: https://pre-commit.com/
[Yarn]: https://yarnpkg.com/

## Linting

A few linters are available. Run `yarn lint` to apply them all.

Some lints can be autofixed with eslint

```bash
yarn lint:eslint:fix
```

Additionally we use prettier to format our code and markdown. Run prettier if you get linting errors in CI:

```bash
yarn lint:prettier:fix
```
