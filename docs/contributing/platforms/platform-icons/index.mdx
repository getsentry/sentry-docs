To have consistent icons for all supported platforms over all of Sentry (the product, the docs, landing pages, etc) we created a repo for managing those icons, it is called [platformicons](https://github.com/getsentry/platformicons).

If there is a new platform we support, there are several steps to be done, so the new icon can be used in the docs:

1. **Add the new icon to `platformicons`:**

    Create a [new issue on the platformicons repository](https://github.com/getsentry/platformicons/issues) and specify how the icon should be named and a link to the website of the platform you want to add. Also, make sure to describe whether it is a top level icon (like `python`) or a subitem that is only available in one specific platform (like `python.celery`).

    You can also create a PR in the repository where you add two versions of the icon. See [README.md](https://github.com/getsentry/platformicons) for the format.

2. **Release a new version of `platformicons` to NPM.**

    If you are a Sentry employee follow the [README.md](https://github.com/getsentry/platformicons) on how to do a release.

    If you are not a Sentry employee ask on our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/Ww9hbqr) so someone can review your contribution and trigger the release.

3. **Update the `platformicons` version used in docs repository.**

    Update the version of your newly released `platformicons` in `package.json` and run `yarn install` to also have the new version in `yarn.lock`.

4. **Make it available as a component in the docs repository.**

    Update [platformIcon.tsx](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-docs/blob/master/src/components/platformIcon.tsx) to have your new icon.

    You need to:
    - add two imports (one for each version of the icon)
    - add it to `formatToSVG`
    - add it to `PLATFORM_TO_ICON`

4. **Now the new Icon is available in the docs and will be used wherever icons are rendered!**
