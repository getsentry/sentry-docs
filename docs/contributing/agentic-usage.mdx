Sentry documentation includes agent skills to help contributors write and review documentation.

## Available Skills

### technical-docs

Guidelines for writing effective technical documentation. Use when creating or editing MDX files in `docs/platforms/`.

Key principles:
- Lead with "why" before "how"
- Structure by user intent, not API surface
- Avoid redundant examples
- Keep content concise

### docs-review

The Sentry documentation style guide. Use when reviewing documentation to ensure it follows Sentry's voice and tone.

Key points:
- Write like a developer talking to a peer
- Be direct and honest (no marketing fluff)
- Use American English, active voice
- Keep paragraphs short (2-3 sentences)

## Adding the Skills

If you're using [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) or another agent that supports the [Agent Skills Discovery](https://github.com/cloudflare/agent-skills-discovery-rfc) protocol:

```bash
npx skills add https://docs.sentry.io
```

This registers all Sentry documentation skills with your AI agent.

## Example Use Cases

Once added, your AI agent can help with:

- "Review this documentation for Sentry style"
- "Help me write a guide for the new SDK feature"
- "Does this page follow our documentation principles?"
- "Rewrite this section to be more scannable"
