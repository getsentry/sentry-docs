You can add arbitrary banners to the top of a page by adding adding an entry to the `BANNERS` array on
the `banner/index.tsx` file. The `BANNERS` array is an array of objects with the following properties:

```typescript {filename:banner/index.tsx}
type BannerType = {
  /** This is an array of strings or RegExps to feed into new RegExp() */
  appearsOn: (string | RegExp)[];
  /** The label for the call to action button */
  linkText: string;
  /** The destination url of the call to action button */
  linkURL: string;
  /** The main text of the banner */
  text: string;
  /** Optional ISO Date string that will hide the banner after this date without the need for a rebuild */
  expiresOn?: string;
};
```

 You can add as many banners as you like. If you need to disable all banners, simply delete them from the array.

 Each banner is evaluated in order, and the first one that matches will be shown.

Examples:

```typescript {filename:banner/index.tsx}
// ...
// appearsOn = [];              // This is disabled
// appearsOn = ['^/$'];         // This is enabled on the home page
// appearsOn = ['^/welcome/'];  // This is enabled on the "/welcome" page
// ...

const BANNERS = [
  // This one will take precedence over the last banner in the array
  // (which matches all /platforms pages), because it matches first.
  {
    appearsOn: ['^/platforms/javascript/guides/astro/'],
    text: 'This banner appears on the Astro guide',
    linkURL: 'https://sentry.io/thought-leadership',
    linkText: 'Get webinarly',
  },

  // This one will match the /welcome page and all /for pages
  {
    appearsOn: ['^/$', '^/platforms/'],
    text: 'This banner appears on the home page and all /platforms pages',
    linkURL: 'https://sentry.io/thought-leadership',
    linkText: 'Get webinarly',
  },
];

```

Optionally, you can add an `expiresOn` property to a banner to hide it after a certain date without requiring a rebuild or manual removeal.
the ISO Date string should be in the format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ` to be parsed correctly and account for timezones.

```typescript {filename:banner/index.tsx}
const BANNERS = [
  {
    appearsOn: ['^/$'],
    text: 'This home page banner will disappear after 2024-12-06',
    linkURL: 'https://sentry.io/party',
    linkText: 'RSVP',
    expiresOn: '2024-12-06T00:00:00Z',
  },
];
```
