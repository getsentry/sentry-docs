Redirects allow you to automatically redirect an incoming request path to a new destination path. When you move or rename a file, you should make sure to set up a redirect from the old path to the new path, so that the old URL still takes users to the right place.

## Add a New Redirect

Redirects are configured in [`next.config.js`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-docs/blob/master/next.config.js) and are checked before the filesystem (including pages and `/public` files ). The `redirects` function returns an array holding redirect objects.

To add a new redirect, add a new object in the redirects array with the following properties:

- `source`: The incoming request path pattern.
- `destination`: The new destination path you want to route to instead.
- `permanent`: Whether the redirect is permanent and should be cached forever (`true`) or is temporary (`false`).

### Example Redirect

The example below adds a redirect for the alerts page after its parent folder was renamed from `alerts-notifications` to `alerts`.

```javascript {filename:next.config.js}
redirects() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/product/alerts-notifications/',
        destination: '/product/alerts/',
        permanent: true,
      },
    ]
}
```
