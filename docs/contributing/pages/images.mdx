If you want to add images to your docs, you can add them next to your `.mdx` files, under `./img` by convention.
You don't have to follow a rigid folder structure as long as the relative path (starts with `./`) to the image is correct.

If an image is used in multiple places, it's best to put it in `includes/common-imgs`, reference it from there in a local `md[x]` file
and then `Include` it in the target `mdx` files.

Images can also be added to the `public` folder (but not recommended for docs images).

<Note>
  Every image that starts with `/` (instead of `./`) is considered to be in the `public` folder.

### Example

- Local images:

The file, `docs/product/alerts/alert-types.mdx`, can reference the local `./img/issue-alert.png` image like so :

```markdown {filename:docs/product/alerts/alert-types.mdx}
![Alert details ...](./img/alert-details-example.png)
```

- Images with multiple references:

The image `docs/common-imgs/imgs/tags.png` is referenced in `docs/common-imgs/tags.md` as a local image:

```markdown {filename:docs/common-imgs/tags.mdx}
![Tags](./img/tags.png)
```

which is then included in many other files:

```markdown {filename:docs/platforms/ruby/common/enriching-events/tags/index.mdx}
<Include name="common-imgs/tags" />
```


## Image Optimization

To save space and ensure consistency, we ask that all image files be compressed and cropped to the dimensions listed below. When adding an image, please makes sure that it's high-resolution and crisp and that text is big enough to read.

### Recommended Dimensions
- If you want the image to take up the full width of the page, make it **1484 pixels** wide.

- If you want the image to be indented once (for example, if it's under a list item), make it **1400 pixels** wide.

### Image Compression

For performance reasons, images should be compressed. We recommend using ImageOptim. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Download and install https://imageoptim.com/.
2. Drag and drop your image(s) into the tool. The files will be compressed in place.
3. Wait until a green checkmark appears, then add the compressed image to the appropriate path in the `public` folder of the docs repo.
