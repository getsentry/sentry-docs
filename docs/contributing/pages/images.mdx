If you want to add images to your docs, you can add them in a `./img` folder in the same directory as your `.mdx` files.
You don't have to follow a rigid folder structure as long as the relative path (starts with `./`) to the image is correct. See [local images](#local-images).

If an image is used in multiple places, it's best to put it in `includes/common-imgs/imgs` and reference it in a local [`include` file ](/contributing/approach/product-docs/write-index/#includes) to be used in the target `mdx` file. See [common images](#common-images).

Alternatively, images can also be added to the `public` folder and referenced using their relative or full path within the folder. See [public images](#public-images)

<Note>
  Every image path that starts with `/` (instead of `./`) is considered to be in the `public` folder.

### Example

#### Local Images

The file, `docs/product/alerts/alert-types.mdx`, can reference the local `docs/product/alerts/img/alert-details-example.png` image like so :

```markdown {filename:docs/product/alerts/alert-types.mdx}
![Alert details ...](./img/alert-details-example.png)
```

#### Common Images

Images that are reused in multiple files should be single-sourced as an `include` file. For example, the common image, `includes/common-imgs/imgs/tags.png`, is referenced in the `include` file, `includes/common-imgs/tags.mdx`, like so:

```markdown {filename:includes/common-imgs/tags.mdx}
![Tags](./img/tags.png)
```

The image can then be used in multiple places (such as `docs/platforms/ruby/common/enriching-events/tags/index.mdx`) by referencing the `include` file with the following syntax:

```markdown {filename:docs/platforms/ruby/common/enriching-events/tags/index.mdx}
<Include name="common-imgs/tags" />
```

#### Public Images

While we recommend storing images locally with the files that reference them, you can also put them in the `public` folder. By default, the docs platform assumes images referenced with paths starting with `/` live in the `public` folder, so you don't need to include `public` in the image path.

The folder structure of `public` mimics that of `docs` so that you can reference these images with relative paths. For example, the file, `docs/product/alerts/alert-types.mdx`, can reference the image, `public/product/alerts/issue-alert.png`, like so :

```markdown {filename:docs/product/alerts/alert-types.mdx}
![Issue alert](issue-alert.png)
```

Content files living elsewhere can also reference public images by using their full paths (excluding `public`). For example, the file, `docs/platform/apple/index.mdx`, can also reference the same image, `public/product/alerts/issue-alert.png`, like so:

```markdown {filename:docs/platform/apple/index.mdx}
![Issue alert](/product/alerts/issue-alert.png)
```

## Image Optimization

To save space and ensure consistency, we ask that all image files be compressed and cropped to the dimensions listed below. When adding an image, please makes sure that it's high-resolution and crisp and that text is big enough to read.

### Recommended Dimensions
- If you want the image to take up the full width of the page, make it **1484 pixels** wide.

- If you want the image to be indented once (for example, if it's under a list item), make it **1400 pixels** wide.

### Image Compression

For performance reasons, images should be compressed. We recommend using ImageOptim. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Download and install https://imageoptim.com/.
2. Drag and drop your image(s) into the tool. The files will be compressed in place.
3. Wait until a green checkmark appears, then add the compressed image to the appropriate path in the `public` folder of the docs repo.
