All images must live in the [`public`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-docs/tree/master/public) folder in order to be processed correctly.

The folder structure of `docs` is duplicated in `public` so that you can still use relative paths to reference images in your content files.

For instance, the file, `docs/product/alerts/alert-types.mdx`, can reference the image, `public/product/alerts/issue-alert.png`, like so :

```markdown {filename:docs/product/alerts/alert-types.mdx}
![Issue alert](issue-alert.png)
```

Content files that live elsewhere (such as `/docs/platform/apple/index.mdx`) can still use the same image by referencing it with the full path (`/public` does not need to be included), like so:

```markdown {filename:/docs/platform/apple/index.mdx}
![Issue alert](/product/alerts/issue-alert.png)
```
