You can use images in your docs by adding them to the `public` folder and referencing them correctly in your .mdx files.

## Folder Structure

All images must live in the [`public`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-docs/tree/master/public) folder in order to be processed correctly.

The folder structure of `docs` is duplicated in `public` so that you can still use relative paths to reference images in your content files.

### Example

For instance, the file, `docs/product/alerts/alert-types.mdx`, can reference the image, `public/product/alerts/issue-alert.png`, like so :

```markdown {filename:docs/product/alerts/alert-types.mdx}
![Issue alert](issue-alert.png)
```

Content files that live elsewhere (such as `/docs/platform/apple/index.mdx`) can still use the same image by referencing it with the full path (`/public` does not need to be included), like so:

```markdown {filename:/docs/platform/apple/index.mdx}
![Issue alert](/product/alerts/issue-alert.png)
```

## Image Optimization

### Recommended Dimensions
If you want the image to take up the full width of the page, the image should have a width of 1484 pixels.

If the image will be indented once (for example, if it's under a list item), then it should have a width of 1400 pixels.

### Image Compression

For performance reasons, images should be compressed. Follow these steps to use ImageOptim to compress your images:

1. Download and install https://imageoptim.com/.
2. Drag your images into it. The files will be compressed in place.
3. Wait until the image is ready, then add it to the appropriate path in the `public` folder of the docs repo.
