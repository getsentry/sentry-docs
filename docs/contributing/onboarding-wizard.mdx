The docs repository is responsible for a piece of functionality in the Sentry product most commonly referred to as _the Wizard_. More precisely, the product pulls in documentation about SDK configuration in part of its project creation / onboarding process.

The content for the onboarding wizard is located in `src/wizard`, and follows slightly different rules than other pages:

- It is markdown _only_. MDX is not currently supported.
- It is exported as plain HTML (encoded as JSON), thus styles need to exist within Sentry itself.
- The exposed frontmatter is specific to the wizard.

## Adding Guides

To add a guide to a platform:

1. Write the guide, following both the guidelines of the [Directory Structure](#directory-structure) and [Page Format](#page-format) as well as the examples that currently exist in the directory; the most up to date is typically the wizard for the browser. Note that you do not directly copy the Getting Started page, as the context of this content differs.
2. If required, add an icon to [`platformicons`](https://github.com/getsentry/platformicons). If added, you also need to add a platform to icon mapping in `src/platformIcon.tsx` on [Sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry), bump the package version and update its version in repositories that use it ([`sentry`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry) and [`docs`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-docs)).
3. Add the platform to Sentry:
   - Add it to the corresponding category in `static/app/data/platformCategories`.
   - Add the platform to `tests/fixtures/integration-docs/_platforms`. Note that you don’t have to add it to `src/sentry/integration-docs`, since this is automatically generated when the platform assets are built.
   - It may be required to be added to platform-specific places, such as `isEventFromBrowserJavaScriptSDK` in `static/app/components/events/interfaces/spans/utils.tsx`.

If after following these steps the guide isn’t on Sentry, you may need to update the platform assets by running `make build-platform-assets`.

## Directory Structure

The directory structure directly influences how content is exposed within onboarding. It takes the form of:

```bash
src/wizard
src/wizard/{platform}/index.md
src/wizard/{platform}/{guide}.md
```

The `index.md` is exposed as the root platform instructions, and `{guide}.md` is exposed as a child integration of the platform. This functions similarly to the [platform pages](../platforms).

## Page Format

Each page consists of some wizard-specific frontmatter, as well as a markdown body:

```markdown {filename:src/wizard/platform/index.md}
---
name: Platform Name
doc_url: Permalink for this page
type: framework
support_level: production
---

This is my content.
```

<Note>

Wizard content is only supported with native markdown (not MDX), thus only with a `.md` extension.
