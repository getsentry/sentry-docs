Issue views let you customize and share your issue stream, so you and your teammates can quickly see the issues that are most relevant to you.

<Alert>
  This feature is only available if your organization has enabled [early adopter features](/organization/early-adopter-features/). Early adopter features are still in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony. If you’re interested in participating, enable early adopter features in [organization settings](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/settings/organization).
</Alert>



## Creating Your First View

To create your first custom issue view, navigate to the [**All Views**](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/issues/views/) page and click the **`+ Create View`** button on the top right.

![All Views Page](./img/issue_views_all_views_create_view.png)

This will create a new starred view, which you can than update with the filters of your choosing. Some common use cases for views include:

**Prioritized:** A view containing only issues with high or medium priority
**Assigned to Me:** A view for issues assigned to yourself and your teams
**For Review:** A view for issues that have been assigned to you or your teams to review
**Request Errors:** A view for issues with requests that returned a 500 status code
**High Volume Errors:**  A view for issues that have occurred a large number of times
**Recent Errors:** A view containing issues that have appeared in the last day
**Function regressions:** A view containing performance issues for functions that have regressed in latency


## Customizing Your Views


### Updating Views

Views are defined by their search query, sort, and project/environment/time range filters. Changing any of these parameters won't automatically persist those changes to your view, however. If your current filters have diverged from the view's original filters, a purple dot will appear next to your view in the navigation, and hovering over it will show which filters have been changed:

To persist these changes to your view, simply click on the purple `Save` button to the right of the search and sort inputs in the Issues page. You may also create a new view with these changes  by clicking `Save as new view`, or you can reset the view back to its original filters by clicking `Reset`.

### Reordering Views

You can reorder the starred views in the navigation by hovering over them and clicking and dragging the handle to the desirable position.


### Renaming Views

To rename a view, navigate to that view's page and hover over the page header, which will reveal a pencil icon. Click the pencil icon to edit the view's name.

You can also do this by navigating to the `All Views` page and clicking on the view's ellipsis menu and selecting `Rename`.

## Sharing Views

### Browsing and Starring Your Organization's Views

All Issue Views are visible to all members of your organization, and you can browse your organization's views by navigating to the [**All Views**](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/issues/views/) page. Keep in mind that some views may filter on projects that you may not have access to. You will not be able to see the issues in these views if open membership is not enabled.

![All Views](./img/issue_views_all_views.png)

Here, you can search for specific views and star any that you want to see in the sidebar.

### Sharing a View

You can share a view to anyone simply by sending them a link to the view. Any organization members will be able to see the view and save a duplicate of it as their own, but only the creator, and organization admins/managers have the permissions to delete or edit it.
