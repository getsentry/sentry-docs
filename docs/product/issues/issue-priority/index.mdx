Issue priority sorts the issues Sentry receives into **High**, **Medium** and **Low** priority buckets. This helps you identify and address critical, high-priority errors that may be impacting your application's functionality and user experience first. 

## How Priority Works

When Sentry receives an event, it assigns a priority to the issue based on the event's **log level** (for error issues) or **severity** (for non-error issues like performance). There are three discrete priority levels for issues in Sentry:

- **High**: Issues that are likely to be actionable and require immediate attention. Issues are determined to be high priority if the event's severity is high or the log level is `error` or `fatal`.
- **Medium**: Issues that are likely to be actionable and require attention in the near future. Issues are determined to be medium priority if the severity is medium or the log level is `warning`.
- **Low**: Issues that don't require immediate attention. Issues are determined to be low priority if the severity is low or the log level is `info` or `debug`.

### Automatic Priority Updates

Sentry continuously monitors the volume of events for each issue. If there's a surge of events for a particular issue (it escalates), its priority level will be automatically bumped up. See the [escalating issues algorithm](/product/issues/states-triage/escalating-issues/) for more information on how escalations are identified. When an issue de-escalates, its priority will go back down to the previous level.

### Manual Priority Updates

You can update issue priority manually at any time, either from the issue details page or from the issue stream. But once an issue's priority has been changed manually, it will no longer be automatically adjusted if the event volume escalates.

## Priority in the Issue Stream

By default, the issue stream on the **Issues** page filters out low-priority issues. If you'd like to be able to see low-priority issues, you can [set your default search](/product/reference/search/saved-searches/#set-a-default-search) to include them.

You can quickly filter the type of issue you'd like to view using the priority dropdown in the "Prioritized" tab on the **Issues** page. You may also update the priority level of multiple issues at once by selecting them and using the bulk action dropdown. Low-priority issues will disappear from the "Prioritized" tab once their priority is updated.
