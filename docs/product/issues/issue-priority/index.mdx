Issue priority sorts the issues Sentry receives into **High**, **Medium** and **Low** priority buckets. This helps you identify and address critical, high-priority errors that may be impacting your application's functionality and user experience first.

## How Priority Works

When Sentry receives an event, it assigns a priority to the issue based on the event's **log level** (for error issues) or **actionability** (for non-error issues like performance).

There are three discrete priority levels for issues in Sentry:

- **High**: Issues that are likely to be actionable and require immediate attention, such as `ERROR` and `FATAL` events.
- **Medium**: Issues that are likely to be actionable and require attention in the near future, including `WARNING` events.
- **Low**: Issues that don't require immediate attention, including `DEBUG` and `INFO` events.

### Enhanced Issue Priority

<Note>

This feature is available only if your organization is on either a [Business](https://sentry.io/pricing/) or [Trial](/pricing/#product-trials) Plan.

</Note>

In addition to the log level or actionability, the enhanced priority calculations will consider factors such as the error message, whether or not the error is handled, and historical actions taken on similar issues, when determining the priority of an issue for Python or JavaScript projects.

### Automatic Priority Updates

Sentry continuously monitors the volume of events for each issue. If there's a surge of events for a particular issue (it escalates), its priority level will be automatically bumped up. See the [escalating issues algorithm](/product/issues/states-triage/escalating-issues/) for more information on how escalations are identified. When an issue de-escalates, its priority will go back down to the previous level.

### Manual Priority Updates

You can update issue priority manually at any time, either from the issue details page or from the issue stream. But once an issue's priority has been changed manually, it will no longer be automatically adjusted if the event volume escalates.

## Priority in the Issue Stream

The default view on the **Issues** page is the "Prioritized" view, which shows high and medium priority issues. But all views can be filtered to include, for example, only low priority issues by adding the query `issue.priority:low` to the search bar and saving the view.

You can also update the priority level of an issue directly from the issue stream by clicking on the priority dropdown within an issue.

You may also update the priority level of multiple issues at once by selecting them and using the bulk action dropdown.
