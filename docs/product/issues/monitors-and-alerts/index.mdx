[Monitors](/product/monitors/) and [Alerts](/product/alerts/) work together to help you create issues and take action when problems occur in your project. While they serve different purposes, they're designed to work as a team.

## How They Work Together

**Monitors** are the "detectors" - they watch for specific conditions and create issues when those conditions are met. **Alerts** are the "responders" - they take action when issues are created or change state and meet the filter criteria of the Alert.

Here's the typical flow:

1. **Monitor detects a problem** → Creates an issue
2. **Issue triggers Alert** → Takes external action (sends notifications, creates tickets, calls webhooks)

## Monitors: Creating Issues

Monitors customize when errors and performance problems become issues. They can track:

- **Custom metrics** and span attributes
- **Scheduled jobs** (cron monitors) 
- **HTTP endpoints** (uptime monitors)
- **Default behaviors** (errors, replays, traces, profiles)

[See all Monitor types](/product/monitors/#types-of-monitors)

When a monitor's conditions are met, it automatically creates an issue with the specified priority, assignee, and other attributes.

## Alerts: Taking Action

Alerts respond to issue state changes by performing external actions like:

- Sending notifications to Slack, email, or other channels
- Creating tickets in JIRA or other project management tools
- Calling webhooks or integrations

## The Connection

Alerts must be connected to Monitors to run. This connection ensures that:

- Issues created by Monitors can trigger appropriate responses
- You have full control over both detection and response
- Actions are taken only for the issues you care about

## Getting Started

1. **Create a Monitor** to define when issues should be created
2. **Create an Alert** to define what actions to take
3. **Connect them** so the Alert responds to issues from that Monitor

Using Monitors and Alerts gives you a complete workflow from problem detection to team notification, ticket creation, and more.
