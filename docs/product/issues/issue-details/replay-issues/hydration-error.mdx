Hydration errors are a React-specific problem that happen when the initial client UI does not match what was rendered on the server. They can result in extra work for the browser, and a slower pageload experience for users.

## Prerequisites for Seeing Hydration Error Diff Tools

Hydration Errors can come into your issue stream either as regular error events, or they could be detected inside a replay and converted into an issue by the server. Read more about
[configuring hydration errors](/platforms/javascript/session-replay/issue-types/) to learn about the differences.

If the hydration error event instance has an associated replay, then you will see diff tools on the **Issue Details** page to make debugging the hydration error easier.

## Debugging Hydration Errors

Hydration errors represent a mismatch between the server-rendered HTML, and the client-rendered HTML. So it's beneficial to compare the before and after state of a webpage to understand what's changed, and decide how to make those two states consistent. To do this, we provide a few diff tools to see the differences -- both visually and by looking at the rendered HTML itself.

Generally, the visual tools are a good place to start to identify the issue, but keep in mind that sometimes differences can appear below the fold, or there can be differences in hidden DOM nodes or attributes, so inspecting the HTML is important too.

#### Example Error

In the example below we'll look at a hydration error and see how each tool helps to debug the problem.

The problem is that the left and right sidebars have some dynamic content that is inserted on the client, but not rendered on the server.

### Image Slider

The image slider tool allows for comparing the two page states by overlaying the images on top of each other. Click and drag the purple line to reveal one image or the other.

### Side-by-Side Image

View images side-by-side to see large chunks of the page that may differ.

### Tree Compare

Use the tree compare tool to list specifically which DOM nodes were added, removed, or had attributes changed.

You can see each change to the page, and when it happened within the context of the hydration error. In this case one mutation happened at the timestamp `1732089574790` which was at time offset `1790`, or 1.7 seconds since the start of the captured replay. Within this mutation 39 nodes were added, 2 nodes had some attributes changed, and 4 nodes were removed.

We show a CSS selector for each node in the tree to make it easier to identify the component that was changed. Note that some changed nodes might exist outside your React render tree and won't cause hydration errors.

### HTML Diff

The HTML diff tool is a basic HTML comparison. It is useful if the hydration error is caused by hidden DOM nodes, different attributes on a DOM node, or there's mismatched content below the fold.

## FAQ

### The diff is blank or there are no changes

Sometimes the diff Sentry shows doesn't contain any visible changes. This is a limitation of debugging React in production mode. You've still got a hydration error to fix even if the diff is blank!

To make debugging easier, adjust the diff boundary to show more changes before or after the error was detected. Click the icon in the top-right corner of the screen and select timestamps that are further away from the error in the center. This will show more changes that may have contributed to the hydration error.

### The HTML view shows extra changes that do not impact the HTML rendering

Sometimes you will see changes to the HTML like attribute being removed, order changing, spaces being removed, or strange classes like `:hover` appearing. These parts of the diff do not impact the HTML that the user sees, and often are not the cause of the hydration error.

This is expected and a side effect of how we capture debugging data after a Hyration Error has occurred.

Some common examples:

![html diff tool](./img/hydration-diff-hover.png)

An attribute `xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"` was removed. This is an XML attribute and is not needed within a valid HTML page, so React did not include it in the render.

![html diff tool](./img/hydration-diff-xmlns.png)

The class name `:hover` was added Session Replay when it serialized the page, React didn't see this class and it has no impact on hydration. This means the user was hovering and interacting with the page before react was finished hydrating (this is the whole point of hydration; to make the page react for interaction sooner!). By the time hydration was complete the user had moved their mouse so the :hover class is changed.

## Privacy

The diff tools all rely on replay data, so any PII data within the webpage will be masked or blocked before being sent to the server by default.
