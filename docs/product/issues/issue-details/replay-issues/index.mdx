If you've enabled [Session Replay](/product/explore/session-replay/), you'll be able to see new issue types on the [**Issues**](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/issues/) page in Sentry.

## Quota Consumption

<Note>
Replay issues do not consume issue quota.
</Note>

After a replay is accepted, consuming replay quota in the process, error detection takes place and error events are grouped into issues, but without consuming issue quota. These errors are created on the backend after ingest and they will not appear on your Stats page under the "Total Errors" or "Accepted Errors" graphs. You are not billed for their volume.

## Replay Issue Types

- [Rage clicks](/product/issues/issue-details/replay-issues/rage-clicks/) are a series of consecutive clicks on the same unresponsive page element. They are a strong signal of user frustration and most likely deserve your attention.

- [Hydration errors](/product/issues/issue-details/replay-issues/hydration-error/) are a React-specific problem that happen when the initial UI does not match what was rendered on the server. They can result in extra work for the browser, and a slower pageload experience for users.
