If you've enabled [Session Replay](/product/session-replay/), you'll be able to see rage click issues on the **Issues** page in Sentry. Rage clicks are a series of consecutive clicks on the same unresponsive element. They are a sure sign of user frustration and most likely deserve your attention.

## Prerequisites for Seeing Rage Clicks

In order to see rage clicks in your issue stream on the **Issues** page, your organization needs to:

- Be sending [session replay events](/product/session-replay/getting-started/)
- Enable the JavaScript SDK (or framework-specific bundle), version 7.60.1 or higher

<Note>
While you can enable **session replay** with JavaScript SDK version 7.27.0, or higher, you'll need to have version 7.60.1 or higher in order to be able to see **rage click issues**.

## Get Rage Click Alerts

To set up alerts and get notified when a rage click occurs, follow these steps:

1. Create a new [Alert Rule](https://sentry.sentry.io/alerts/new/issue/) in Sentry.
2. In the "Set conditions" section, set the "IF" filter to "The issue's category is equal to", then choose "Replay" from the dropdown.
3. Add an optional filter if you like.
5. Choose the action to be performed in the "THEN" dropdown.
6. Decide how often you'd like Sentry to look for rage click issues.
7. Lastly, name your alert and add an owner.

## Turn Off Rage Click Issues

If you don't want to see rage click issues, you can disable them by going to the **Settings** page in Sentry, clicking "Projects", and selecting the project for which you want to disable rage clicks. From here, select "Replays" under the "PROCESSING" heading and toggle off "Create Rage Click Issues".
