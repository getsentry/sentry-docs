<Alert title="Currently in Beta">

Feature flag change tracking and feature flag evaluation tracking is currently in open beta.

</Alert>

Enabling a feature flag integration provides deep insights into the state of your application prior to an error. A list of flags and their evaluation results are displayed on each error event in the order of evaluation. Integrating Sentry with your feature flag provider enables Sentry to correlate feature flag changes with new error events and mark certain changes as suspicious.

## Evaluation Tracking

Flag evaluations will appear in the "Feature Flag" section of Issue Details page as a table, with "suspect" flag predictions highlighted in yellow. Learn more about how to interact with feature flag insights within the Sentry UI by reading the [Issue Details page documentation](/product/issues/issue-details/#feature-flags).

### Set Up Evaluation Tracking

To set up evaluation tracking, visit the SDK integration documentation for your platform:
* [JavaScript](/platforms/javascript/feature-flags/)
* [Python](/platforms/python/feature-flags/)

## Change Tracking

Change tracking enables Sentry to listen for additions, removals, and modifications to your feature flags. On change, we'll record the change event in the audit log. The audit log appears in the "event volume" chart and presents itself as a "release" line. If the change is responsible for a new error event, we'll notify you by marking the feature flag as "suspect" on the Issue Details page. Learn more about how to interact with feature flag insights within the Sentry UI by reading the [Issue Details documentation](/product/issues/issue-details/#feature-flags).
