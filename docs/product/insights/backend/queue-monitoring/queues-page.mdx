The **Queues** page provides a breakdown of queue performance by destination (the topic name or queue name). Use it as a starting point to investigate potential problems with queues, such as higher than expected processing latency.

A the top of the page, the Average Latency graph shows the total time that messages take to complete. The Published versus Processed graph shows how many messages are being written to the queue versus how many are being completed. If you see an anomaly or want to investigate a time range further, click and drag to select a range directly in the graph and you'll see data for that specific time range only.

The destination table shows where messages are being published to, along with:

- Throughput (the time spent both waiting and being processed in the queue)
- Error rate (how often do jobs fail to complete)
- Published versus processed count
- Time spent (total time your application spent processing jobs)

If you want to dig deeper into the behavior of a specific destination, click the destination name to view the **Destination Summary** page.

## Destination Summary Page

To view the **Destination Summary** page click a [destination](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/messaging/messaging-spans/#destinations) in the **Queues** page.

At the top of the page you'll see average time in queue, average processing latency, error rate, published versus processed counts, and the total time spent by your application processing jobs. These metrics are shown in relation to the destination, whereas the **Queues** page shows summed up metrics across all destinations. Below the summary you can view graphs for average latency and published versus processed counts.

At the bottom of the page, a table is shown listing transactions that either published or processed queue messages.

If a problem with a specific endpoint jumps out at you, click the transaction to view sample spans and to navigate to the corresponding trace.

### Sample List

Click on an endpoint to open a list of sample spans. This side panel varies depending on whether you click on a producer (your application writing messages to the queue) or consumer transaction.

### Producer Sample List

Sentry automatically finds a variety of samples to help you investigate performance problems. The chosen spans cover the entire selected time range, as well as a range of durations and failure statues.

The Producer panel shows the number of messages the producer has published, the error rate (representing errors that occur while publishing the message), and the average duration of the transaction that publishes the message to the queue.

To dig even deeper, click on a span identifier to view a detailed trace.

### Consumer Sample List

Sentry automatically finds a variety of samples to help you investigate performance problems. The chosen spans cover the entire selected time range, as well as a range of durations and failure statues.

The Consumer panel shows the number of messages the consumer has processed, the error rate, the average time a message spends in a queue, and the average amount of time spent processing the message.
