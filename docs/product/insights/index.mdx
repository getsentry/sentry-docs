Sentryâ€™s frontend, backend, mobile, and AI performance insights (all under the [**Insights**](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/insights/) heading in Sentry), give you a clear summary of the telemetry and events impacting the performance of individual parts of your application. Each section shows a high-level overview of your application's health with widgets for "Best Page Opportunities" (improvement that will be most helpful for boosting your performance score), most time-consuming events, and so on. You can also drill deeper into specific workflows to see specific traces, errors, and releases. This helps you identify potential problems and spot trends, fix bugs, and ultimately boost application performance.
