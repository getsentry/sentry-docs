Sentry surfaces insights that can help you identify opportunities at the service-level to improve various parts of your app's performance, including web vitals, mobile vitals, queries, and more. Modules living under the Insights heading provide both an overview of how your project is performing in that category and the ability to drill down into traces to get to the root cause of a problem.

<Note>

These features are available for organizations on a <a href="https://sentry.io/pricing/" target="_blank">Business or Enterprise plan</a>.
