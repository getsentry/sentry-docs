Once you've [configured the Sentry SDK](/product/insights/ai/mcp/getting-started/) for your MCP project, you'll start receiving data in the Sentry [MCP Insights](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/insights/mcp/) dashboard.

The main dashboard provides a comprehensive view of all your MCP server activities, performance metrics, and recent tool executions.

![MCP Monitoring Overview](./img/overview.png)

The dashboard displays key widgets like:

- **Traffic**: Shows MCP requests over time, error rates, and releases to track overall server activity and health
- **Traffic by Client**: Displays which MCP clients are connecting to your server (cursor-vscode, CustomMCPClient, etc.)
- **Transport Distribution**: Shows the distribution of transport protocols used (http, sse, custom transports)
- **Most Used Tools/Resources/Prompts**: Shows which MCP tools/resources/prompts are called most frequently by clients
- **Slowest Tools/Resources/Prompts**: Identifies tools/resources/prompts with the highest response times for performance optimization
- **Most Failing Tools/Resources/Prompts**: Highlights tools/resources/propmpts with the highest error rates that need attention

Underneath these widgets are tables that allow you to view data in more detail:

- **Tools**: Performance metrics for each MCP tool including request count, error rate, average duration, and P95 latency
- **Resources**: Access patterns and performance for MCP resources by URI, showing requests, error rate, average duration, and P95 latency
- **Prompts**: Usage statistics for MCP prompt templates by name, including requests, error rate, average duration, and P95 latency
