Sentry MCP Monitoring helps you track and debug Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementations using our supported SDKs and integrations. Monitor your complete MCP workflows from client connections to server responses, including tool executions, resource access, and protocol communications.

To start sending MCP data to Sentry, make sure you've created a Sentry project for your MCP-enabled repository and follow the guide below:

## Supported SDKs

### JavaScript - MCP Server

The Sentry JavaScript SDK supports MCP monitoring through the MCP Server integration, which works with Node.js. This integration automatically captures spans for your MCP server workflows using the MCP TypeScript SDK's built-in telemetry.

#### Quick Start with MCP Server

```javascript

import { Sentry } from "@sentry/node";

// Sentry init needs to be above everything else
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "<YOUR DSN>",
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  integrations: [Sentry.mcpServerIntegration()],
});

// Your MCP server
const server = Sentry.wrapMcpServerWithSentry(new McpServer({
    name: "my-mcp-server",
    version: "1.0.0",
}));

...
```
