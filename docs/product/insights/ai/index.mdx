Sentry's [**AI Performance**](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/insights/ai/) page gives you an overview of the health of your application. You'll be able to see things like **Transactions Per Minute**, **p50** and **p75 Duration**, and so on.

You can also dive deeper into LLM Monitoring and get insights into critical LLM metrics, like token usage, to monitor and fix issues with AI pipelines. In addition to having a dedicated space to monitor AI performance, you can also look at Sentry's Insights tab to monitor backend, mobile, and frontend performance.
