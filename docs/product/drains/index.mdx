description: Learn how to set up log and trace drains to send logs and traces to Sentry from managed hosting platforms.
---

Log and trace drains connect your hosting platform's native telemetry system directly to Sentry, letting you send [logs](/product/explore/logs/) and [traces](/product/explore/trace-explorer/) without modifying your application code.

<Alert>

**How is this different from OTLP Forwarding?** Log and trace drains use your hosting platform's built-in telemetry export feature—you just configure a destination and the platform handles the rest. [OTLP Forwarding](/concepts/otlp/forwarding/) is for when you need to run your own pipeline (like the OpenTelemetry Collector) to collect data from infrastructure sources.

| Platform                                                | Logs | Traces |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | :--: | :----: |

## Limitations

Log and trace drains support logs and traces only:

- **Errors**: To capture errors, add the [Sentry SDK](/platforms/) to your application.
- **Metrics**: Not currently supported. If you're interested in this, reach out on [GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/issues/103486) or email [feedback-metrics@sentry.io](mailto:feedback-metrics@sentry.io).
