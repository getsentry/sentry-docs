description: Learn how to set up trace and log drains and forwarders to send data to Sentry.

To send data to Sentry, we recommend using the Sentry SDKs. However we also support forwarding data to Sentry from platforms where you can't use the Sentry SDKs. At the moment we only support forwarding logs and traces data, error events are not supported yet.
