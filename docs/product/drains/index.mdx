description: Learn how to set up platform drains to send logs and traces to Sentry from managed hosting platforms.
---

Platform drains connect your hosting platform's native telemetry system directly to Sentry, letting you send [logs](/product/explore/logs/) and [traces](/product/explore/trace-explorer/) without modifying your application code.

<Alert level="info">

Sending error events via platform drains is not currently supported. To capture errors you'll need to add the [Sentry SDK](/platforms/) to your application.
