description: Learn how to set up drains and forwarders to send logs and traces to Sentry.

## Overview

Drains and forwarders let you send [logs](/product/explore/logs/) and [traces](/product/explore/trace-explorer/) to Sentry without modifying your application code. They're ideal when:

- You want to capture **platform-level telemetry** from your hosting infrastructure (e.g., Vercel Build Logs, Cloudflare Workers Traces).
- You **can't install Sentry SDKs** directly in your application (e.g., Nginx Traces, Postgres Logs)
- You're using an existing OpenTelemetry pipeline and want to start routing logs and traces data to Sentry via Sentry's [OpenTelemetry support](/concepts/otlp/).

<Alert level="info">

Sending error events via drains or forwarders is not currently supported. To capture errors you'll need to add the [Sentry SDK](/platforms/) to your application.

## Platform Drains

**Platform drains** connect your hosting platform's native telemetry system directly to Sentry (e.g., Vercel, Cloudflare, Heroku)

| Platform                                                          | Logs | Traces |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | :--: | :----: |
| [Vercel](/product/drains/integration/vercel/)                     |  ✅  |   ✅   |
| [Cloudflare Workers](/product/drains/integration/cloudflare/)     |  ✅  |   ✅   |
| [Heroku](/product/drains/integration/heroku/)                     |  ✅  |   ✅   |
| [Supabase](/product/drains/integration/supabase/)                 |  ✅  |   ❌   |
| [Shopify Hydrogen](/product/drains/integration/shopify-hydrogen/) |  ❌  |   ✅   |

## Forwarders

**Forwarders** collect logs and traces from various sources and route them to Sentry.

| Forwarder                                                                                     | Logs | Traces |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--: | :----: |
| [OpenTelemetry Collector](/product/drains/integration/opentelemetry-collector/) (recommended) |  ✅  |   ✅   |
| [Vector](/product/drains/integration/vector/)                                                 |  ✅  |   ❌   |
| [Fluent Bit](/product/drains/integration/fluentbit/)                                          |  ✅  |   ✅   |
