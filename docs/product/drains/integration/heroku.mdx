Heroku Telemetry supports [exporting OpenTelemetry (OTEL)-compliant data](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-telemetry) to send logs and traces to Sentry. Sending metrics is not supported yet.

<Alert level="warning">

Heroku telemetry drains are only available to [Fir](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/generations#fir)-generation apps and spaces. We are tracking support for Cedar-generation apps and spaces in [this issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/issues/91727).

</Alert>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A Heroku app that you want to monitor
- A Sentry project you want to send data to

## Adding a Telemetry Drain

To add a telemetry drain to an app or space, use the `heroku telemetry:add` command. For more details, see the [Heroku Telemetry documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/working-with-heroku-telemetry-drains#add-a-telemetry-drain).

When using the `heroku telemetry:add` command, you'll need to provide your Sentry project's OTLP endpoint URL and a `x-sentry-auth` header with the public key. This can be found in your [Sentry Project Settings](https://sentry.io/settings/projects/) under **Client Keys (DSN)** > **OpenTelemetry (OTLP)**.

```bash
heroku telemetry:add ___OTLP_URL___ --app myapp --signals logs,traces --transport http --headers '{"x-sentry-auth":"sentry sentry_key=___PUBLIC_KEY___"}'
```

To add a telemetry drain to the entire space:

```bash
heroku telemetry:add ___OTLP_URL___ --space myspace --signals logs,traces --headers '{"x-sentry-auth":"sentry sentry_key=___PUBLIC_KEY___"}'
```

You can use the `--signals` flag to specify the signals you want to send to Sentry. Only `logs` and `traces` are supported.

<Alert level="warning">

Sentry only supports the `http` `--transport` flag.
