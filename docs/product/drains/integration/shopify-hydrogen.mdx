[Shopify Hydrogen trace exports](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/headless/hydrogen/trace-exports) let you send a sample of your request traces to Sentry via the OpenTelemetry (OTLP) format.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A Shopify Hydrogen app you want to monitor
- A Sentry project you want to send data to

## Trace Drains

Go through the following steps to set up trace exports:

1. From your Shopify admin, under **Sales channels**, click **Hydrogen**.
2. On the **Hydrogen storefront page**, click **Storefront settings**.
3. On the **Storefront settings page**, click **Integrations**.
4. On the **Integrations settings** page, click **Connect an observability drain** and select **HTTP**.
5. Under the trace export endpoint URL field add the Sentry OTLP traces endpoint in the URL field. You can find the endpoint in your [Sentry Project Settings](https://sentry.io/settings/projects/) under **Client Keys (DSN)** > **OpenTelemetry (OTLP)** under the **OTLP Traces Endpoint** section.

```bash
___OTLP_TRACES_URL___
```

6. Add the Sentry Authentication Header under the authentication headers section. You'll also find the header value in your [Sentry Project Settings](https://sentry.io/settings/projects/) under **Client Keys (DSN)** > **OpenTelemetry (OTLP)** under the **OTLP Traces Endpoint Headers** section.

```
x-sentry-auth: sentry sentry_key=___PUBLIC_KEY___
```

7. Click **Save** to save your configuration. After you save the configuration, sampled traces start flowing to Sentry. It may take a few minutes, and you'll need to generate traffic on your storefront before traces appear.
