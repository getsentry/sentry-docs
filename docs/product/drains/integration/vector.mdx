description: Learn how to set up Vector to forward logs to Sentry via OpenTelemetry.
---

You can configure [Vector](https://vector.dev/) to forward logs to Sentry using its [OpenTelemetry sink](https://vector.dev/docs/reference/configuration/sinks/opentelemetry/).

<Alert level="info">

This integration requires Vector version [0.51.0](https://vector.dev/releases/0.51.0/) or higher, which introduced the `otlp` codec for encoding events in OpenTelemetry format.

</Alert>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Vector installed and running
- A Sentry project you want to send data to

## Configuration

To send logs to Sentry, configure Vector with an OpenTelemetry sink that points to your Sentry OTLP logs endpoint. You can find your endpoint and authentication details in your [Sentry Project Settings](https://sentry.io/settings/projects/) under **Client Keys (DSN)** > **OpenTelemetry (OTLP)**.

Add the following sink configuration to your Vector configuration file:

```yaml {filename:vector.yaml}
sinks:
  sentry_logs:
    inputs:
      - your_source_id # Replace with your actual source ID
    type: opentelemetry
    protocol:
      type: http
      uri: ___OTLP_LOGS_URL___
      headers:
        x-sentry-auth: "sentry sentry_key=___PUBLIC_KEY___"
    encoding:
      codec: otlp
```

```toml {filename:vector.toml}
[sinks.sentry_logs]
inputs = ["your_source_id"]  # Replace with your actual source ID
type = "opentelemetry"

[sinks.sentry_logs.protocol]
type = "http"
uri = "___OTLP_LOGS_URL___"

[sinks.sentry_logs.protocol.headers]
x-sentry-auth = "sentry sentry_key=___PUBLIC_KEY___"

[sinks.sentry_logs.encoding]
codec = "otlp"
```

### Configuration Options

- **inputs**: The source or transform IDs that feed data into this sink
- **type**: Must be `opentelemetry` to use the OTLP sink
- **protocol.type**: Use `http` for HTTP transport
- **protocol.uri**: Your Sentry OTLP logs endpoint
- **protocol.headers**: Authentication headers including the `x-sentry-auth` header with your Sentry public key
- **encoding.codec**: Must be `otlp` for OpenTelemetry protocol encoding

## Example: Forwarding File Logs

Here's a complete example that reads logs from a file and forwards them to Sentry:

```yaml {filename:vector.yaml}
sources:
  app_logs:
    type: file
    include:
      - /var/log/app/*.log

sinks:
  sentry_logs:
    inputs:
      - app_logs
    type: opentelemetry
    protocol:
      type: http
      uri: ___OTLP_LOGS_URL___
      headers:
        x-sentry-auth: "sentry sentry_key=___PUBLIC_KEY___"
    encoding:
      codec: otlp
```
