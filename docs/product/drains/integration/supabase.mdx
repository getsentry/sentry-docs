The [Sentry Supabase Log drain](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/telemetry/log-drains#sentry) will forward all logs from your Supabase stack to Sentry.

<Alert level="warning">

Supabase Log Drains are only available on the Supabase Team and Enterprise Plans

</Alert>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A Supabase project that you want to monitor
- A Sentry project you want to send data to

## Adding a Log Drain

To set up the Sentry log drain, follow these steps:

1. Grab your DSN from your [Sentry project settings](https://docs.sentry.io/concepts/key-terms/dsn-explainer/#where-to-find-your-data-source-name-dsn).

```bash
___DSN___
```

2. Create a Sentry log drain in the [Supabase dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/log-drains). Make sure you provide the DSN you grabbed in the previous step.

Then you should get logs in your Sentry project. All fields from the log event are attached as attributes to the Sentry log, which can be used for filtering and grouping in the Sentry UI.
