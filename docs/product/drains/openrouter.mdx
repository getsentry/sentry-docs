description: Learn how to set up OpenRouter Broadcast to forward trace data from your LLM requests to Sentry.
---

[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) is an AI API router that provides a unified interface for accessing multiple LLM providers. OpenRouter's [Broadcast feature](https://openrouter.ai/docs/guides/features/broadcast/sentry) lets you send traces from your LLM requests to Sentry via the OpenTelemetry (OTLP) format.

<Alert level="info">

OpenRouter's Broadcast feature is currently in beta. The configuration and features may change.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- An OpenRouter account with API access
- A Sentry project you want to send data to

## Step 1: Get your Sentry OTLP endpoint and DSN

1. In Sentry, navigate to your [Sentry Project Settings](https://sentry.io/settings/projects/)
2. Go to **Client Keys (DSN)** and click on the **OpenTelemetry** tab
3. Copy the **OTLP Traces Endpoint** URL (ends with `/v1/traces`):

```bash
___OTLP_TRACES_URL___
```

4. Copy your **DSN** from the same page:

```bash
___DSN___
```

## Step 2: Enable Broadcast in OpenRouter

1. Log in to your OpenRouter account
2. Go to [Settings > Broadcast](https://openrouter.ai/settings/broadcast)
3. Toggle **Enable Broadcast** to turn on the feature

## Step 3: Configure Sentry destination

1. Click the edit icon next to **Sentry**
2. Enter your **OTLP Traces Endpoint** (e.g., `https://o123.ingest.us.sentry.io/api/456/integration/otlp/v1/traces`)
3. Enter your **Sentry DSN** (e.g., `https://abc123@o123.ingest.us.sentry.io/456`)

## Step 4: Test and save

1. Click **Test Connection** to verify the setup
2. The configuration only saves if the test passes

## Step 5: Verify traces in Sentry

Make an API request through OpenRouter and view the trace in Sentry's [Trace Explorer](/product/explore/trace-explorer/). It may take a few minutes for traces to appear.
