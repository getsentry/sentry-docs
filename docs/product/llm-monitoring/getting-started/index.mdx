Sentry LLM Monitoring is easiest to use with the Python SDK and an official integration like OpenAI.

![LLM Monitoring User Interface](../img/pipelines-view.png)


To start sending LLM data to Sentry, make sure you've created a Sentry project for your AI-enabled repository and follow one of the guides below:

## Official AI Integrations

- [OpenAI](/platforms/python/integrations/openai/)
- [Langchain](/platforms/python/integrations/langchain/)
- [Anthropic](/platforms/python/integrations/anthropic/)
- [Huggingface Hub](/platforms/python/integrations/huggingface_hub/)
- [Cohere](/platforms/python/integrations/cohere/)

<Alert level="note" title="Don't see your platform?">

We'll be adding AI integrations continuously. You can also instrument AI manually with the Sentry Python SDK.

## Pipelines and LLMs

The Sentry LLM Monitoring feature relies on the fact that you have an orchestrator (like langchain) creating pipelines of one or more LLMs (such as gpt-4). In the LLM Monitoring dashboard, we show you a table of the AI pipelines and pull the token usage from your LLMs.

If you're using a provider like OpenAI without an orchestrator like langchain, you'll need to manually create pipelines with the `@ai_track` annotation. If you're using a non-supported LLM provider and want to record token usage, use the `record_token_usage()` helper function. Both manual helpers are documented below.

### Python SDK Decorators

The [Python SDK](/platforms/python) includes an `@ai_track` decorator which will mark functions as AI-related and
cause them to show up in the LLM Monitoring dashboard.

```python

import time
from sentry_sdk.ai_monitoring import ai_track, record_token_usage
import sentry_sdk
import requests

@ai_track(description="AI tool")
def some_workload_function(**kwargs):
    """
    This function is an example of calling arbitrary code with @ai_track so that it shows up in the Sentry trace
    """
    time.sleep(5)

@ai_track(description="LLM")
def some_llm_call():
    """
    This function is an example of calling an LLM provider that isn't officially supported by Sentry.
    """
    with sentry_sdk.start_span(op="ai.chat_completions.create.examplecom", description="Example.com LLM") as span:
        result = requests.get('https://example.com/api/llm-chat?question=say+hello').json()
        # this annotates the tokens used by the LLM so that they show up in the graphs in the dashboard
        record_token_usage(span, total_tokens=result["usage"]["total_tokens"])
        return result["text"]

@ai_track(description="My AI pipeline")
def some_pipeline():
    """
    The topmost level function with @ai_track gets the operation "ai.pipeline", which makes it show up
    in the table of AI pipelines in the Sentry LLM Monitoring dashboard.
    """
    client = OpenAI()
    # Data can be passed to the @ai_track annotation to include metadata
    some_workload_function(sentry_tags={"username": "my_user"}, sentry_data={"data": "some longer data that provides context"})
    some_llm_call()
    response = (
        client.chat.completions.create(
            model="some-model", messages=[{"role": "system", "content": "say hello"}]
        )
        .choices[0]
        .message.content
    )
    print(response)

with sentry_sdk.start_transaction(op="ai-inference", name="The result of the AI inference"):
    some_pipeline()

```
