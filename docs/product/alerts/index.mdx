Sentry's Alerts help you take action when issues occur in your project. When an issue changes state, is created, or passes a threshold, an alert is triggered to perform external actions like sending notifications, creating tickets, or calling webhooks and integrations. Alerts must be paired with [Monitors](/product/monitors/) to run. 

### Some examples of when you could use an Alert
- Send a notification to your team's Slack channel when a new error occurs in an existing issue
- Create a ticket in JIRA when an issue is created and a team member is assigned
- Call a webhook or integration when an issue is created

## Creating an Alert

To create an Alert, navigate to the [Alerts](https://sentry.io/issues/alerts/new/) page and click **Create Alert**.

### Set Triggers

A trigger is an action that must occur for the Alert to run. All trigger actions are issue state based. For example, you may want to send a notification to your team's Slack channel _when an issue is created_. You can select multiple triggers in a single Alert. They will run under an `ANY` condition, meaning that if any one of the triggers happen, the Alert will run. 

### Set Filters 

Filters are conditions that must be met for the Alert to run. For example, you may want to create a ticket _only for issues that are assigned to a specific team_ and _at a certain severity_. You can create multiple filters in a single Alert, and group them under either `ANY` or `ALL` conditions. For `ANY` conditions, if any one of the filters are true, the Alert will run. For `ALL` conditions, only if all of the filters are true, the Alert will run.

### Add Actions

Actions are the events that will be executed when the Alert is run. You can send notifications on any channel you're integrated with, create tickets, for example, in JIRA, or call a webhook or integration. You can set multiple actions in a single Alert. Learn more about Sentry's [integrations](/organization/integrations/).

**Note:** Some Monitors can only alert on certain integrations. See Sentry's [integrations](/organization/integrations/) for more information.

## Connecting Alerts to Monitors

In order for Alerts to run, you need to connect them to at least one Monitor. To do so, select **Add Monitor** in the alert configuration page. You can add multiple monitors to an Alert.

**Note**: If you set particular Environments as a filter in your Alert, it will only run for issues in those Environments, even if the Alert is connected to a Monitor that is filtered to different environments.

## Managing Alerts

You can see a list of all your Alerts on the [Alerts](https://sentry.io/issues/alerts/) page. By default, Alerts are filtered down to your projects. 

<Alert>

Alerts are an Organization-level feature. By default, all team members can create and edit Alerts. You can update this setting in [Organization Membership settings](https://sentry.io/settings/organization/).

</Alert>

By clicking on an Alert, you can view the details, edit the Alert, or turn it on or off.

The details page will show a high level chart of how often the Alert has run, a list of the most recent runs, the configuration, and connected monitors.

## Notifications

Besides Alerts, Sentry sends you notifications about various things like [issue state changes](/product/issues/states-triage/), [release deploys](/product/releases/), and [quota usage](/pricing/quotas/). You can fine-tune these notifications, as well as your personal alert settings, in **User Settings > Notifications**. Learn more about notifications and adjusting their associated settings in [the full documentation](/product/alerts/notifications/).
