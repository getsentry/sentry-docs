<Include name="feature-stage-alpha-uptime.mdx" />

The automatic detection of uptime alerts sets up uptime alerts for the most frequently encountered
hostnames in all URLs of your error data. This helps ensure that critical hostnames are continuously monitored,
enhancing the reliability and availability of your web services.

## How It Works

We analyze all the URLs detected in your project's captured error data to find the hostname that appears most frequently. We then create an uptime alert if it passes our [uptime check criteria](/product/alerts/uptime-monitoring/#uptime-check-criteria).

To avoid creating flaky alerts, the hostname undergoes an "onboarding period" of three days. During this period, we send HTTP requests to the hostname every hour. If the request fails at least three times, the hostname is dropped and re-evaluated after seven days.

<Alert level="info">
Sentry will execute uptime checks against the hostname root path of the most frequently seen URLs. For example, if the most seen URL in your events is `GET https://www.example.com/docs/introduction` the check will be `GET https://www.example.com/`.
</Alert>

## Disabling Automatic Detection

If you prefer not to use automatically detected uptime alerts, you have two options to disable them:

1. **Deleting Uptime Alerts:** You can directly delete existing automatically detected uptime alerts from your [Alerts page](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/alerts/rules). Once deleted, these alerts will not be re-created automatically in the future.
2. **Blocking Sentry via `robots.txt`:** Another method to prevent automatic detection is by updating your hostname's robots.txt file to block Sentryâ€™s uptime monitoring bot. To do this, add the following lines to your robots.txt file:

```txt{tabTitle: Example}{filename: robots.txt}
User-agent: SentryUptimeBot
Disallow: *
```

<Alert level="warning">
**Note:** The `robots.txt` file will only prevent Sentry from detecting URLs that it encounters in the future. Existing URLs that have already been detected will continue to have uptime alerts unless they are manually deleted.
</Alert>

## Current Limitations

At present, automatically detected uptime alerts have limited editability. You cannot update the URLs associated with these alerts. Only the alert name and owner can be modified. The ability to edit URLs and other alert settings is planned for a future release. Additionally, each organization is limited to one automatically detected hostname.
