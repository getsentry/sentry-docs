<Include name="feature-stage-alpha-uptime.mdx" />

The automatic detection of uptime alerts sets up uptime alerts for the most frequently encountered
hostnames in all URLs of your error data. This helps ensure that critical hostnames are continuously monitored,
enhancing the reliability and availability of your web services.

## How It Works

We analyze all URLs detected in your project's captured error data, finding the most frequently seen hostnames.
For the most frequently seen hostname, an uptime alert is created if it passes our
[uptime check criteria](/product/alerts/uptime-monitoring/#uptime-check-criteria).

To avoid flaky alerts from being created, the hostname undergoes an
"onboarding period" of three days. During this period, we send HTTP requests to the hostname every hour. If the
request fails at least three times, the hostname is dropped and re-evaluated after seven days.

<Alert level="info">
Sentry will execute uptime checks against the hostname root path of the most frequently seen URLs. Example, if the
  most seen URL in your events is `GET https://www.example.com/docs/introduction` the check will be made as `GET
  https://www.example.com/`.

## Disabling Automatic Detection

Automatically created uptime alerts can be deleted. Deleting an alert will disable automatic detection for the
entire project linked to the host. This feature can be turned off globally for the entire organization in the
[organization settings](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/settings/organization) page.

Alternatively, the hostname's `robots.txt` can be updated to disallow Sentry:

```txt{tabTitle: Example}{filename: robots.txt}
User-agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; SentryUptimeBot/1.0; +http://docs.sentry.io/product/alerts/uptime-monitoring/)
Disallow: *
```

## Current Limitations

Automatically detected uptime alerts cannot be edited at this time; they can only be deleted. Support for editing
will be added in the future. Additionally, each organization is limited to one automatically detected host.
