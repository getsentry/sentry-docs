Sentry's Uptime Monitoring lets you monitor the availability and reliability of your web services effortlessly.
In the current version, uptime is [automatically configured](/product/alerts/uptime-monitoring/automatic-detection/) as a new alert for only the most relevant URL detected in your organization. In future updates, you'll have the flexibility to add and monitor additional URLs.

## Uptime Check Criteria

Our uptime monitoring system verifies the availability of your URLs
by performing GET requests at regular 5-minute intervals.
For a URL to be considered up and running, the response must meet the following criteria:

1. **Successful Response (2xx Status Codes):**
The URL must return an HTTP status code in the 200–299 range, indicating a successful request.
2. **Automatic Handling of Redirects (3xx Status Codes):** Sentry will follow redirects for URLs returning an HTTP status code in the 300–399 range and verify that the final destination URL returns a successful response. This ensures that redirects won't falsely trigger downtime alerts.
3. **Timeout Setting:** Each request has a timeout threshold of 10 seconds.
If the server doesn't respond within this period, the check will be marked as a failure,
indicating a potential downtime or performance issues.
4. **DNS Issue Detection:** Our monitoring also includes the detection of DNS resolution issues.
If a DNS issue is detected, the check will be marked as a failure,
allowing you to address the underlying connectivity problems.

## Notifications

An uptime alert continuously monitors the configured URL with the criteria defined above. If a failure is detected,
a new [uptime issue](/product/issues/issue-details/uptime-issues/) with failed check and related errors details will be created.

To start getting notifications for a new downtime issue, [configure an issue alert](/product/alerts/create-alerts/issue-alert-config/) and choose the issue category "uptime". Then choose how you'd like to be notified (via email, Slack, and so on).
