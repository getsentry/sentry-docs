## Verify Feature Eligibility

Uptime alerts are only available for organizations that have early adopter features enabled. They must also have URLs that match our [auto detection criteria](/product/alerts/uptime-monitoring/automatic-detection/#how-it-works). In the current version, organizations are limited to a single uptime alert.

## Verify Firewall Configuration

Some hosting platforms can block incoming requests from Sentry's Uptime Bot, falsely triggering uptime alerts. We recommend verifying your firewall configuration to ensure incoming requests from Sentry are allowed.

If you need to configure your firewall allowlist to include Sentry's Uptime Bot, we recommend checking against our `User-Agent`, given that our IP addresses can change without notice.

### User Agent

Our uptime check requests use the following `User-Agent`:

```
SentryUptimeBot/1.0 (+http://docs.sentry.io/product/alerts/uptime-monitoring/)
```

### IP Addresses

See [IP Ranges](/security-legal-pii/security/ip-ranges/#uptime-monitoring) for a complete list of IP addresses used for uptime checks.

## Verify That Issue Alerts Match Downtime Issues

Uptime alerts create downtime issues. If you're not receiving notifications when downtimes are detected, make sure you've properly [configured an issue alert](/product/alerts/create-alerts/issue-alert-config/) with the issue category "uptime".
