Sentry provides several configuration options for creating an uptime alert based on your organization's needs as explained below.

## 1. Environment

First, specify which <PlatformLink to="/configuration/environments/">environment</PlatformLink> this alert rule belongs to. Any [uptime issues](/product/issues/issue-details/uptime-issues/) that will be created from this alert rule will then be set to your specified environment.

The “Environment” dropdown lists the same environments available in your project, excluding hidden ones.

## 2. Project

Specify the project associated with your alert rule. Any [uptime issues](/product/issues/issue-details/uptime-issues/) created will appear under this project.

## 3. Request Configuration

Configure how Sentry performs HTTP uptime checks by setting the following options:

- **Interval**: The time between each uptime check. Options: `1 minute`, `5 minutes`, `10 minutes`, `20 minutes`, `30 minutes`, and `1 hour`.
- **Timeout**: The maximum time Sentry waits for a response before considering the request a failure (up to 30 seconds).
- **URL**: The target URL for the uptime check.
- **Method**: The HTTP method used (`GET`, `POST`, `HEAD`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`, or `OPTIONS`).
- **Headers**: Custom headers included in the request.
- **Body**: The request payload, available for `POST`, `PUT`, and `PATCH` methods.
- **Allow Sampling**: Enables span sampling for requests via the Sentry SDK. See [distributed tracing with uptime](/product/alerts/uptime-monitoring/uptime-tracing/) for details.

<Alert level="warning">

When adding HTTP headers, be cautious of including sensitive data, such as API tokens or personal information, to prevent unintended exposure or storage.

Below the request configuration, you'll find an example of the expected request that Sentry will send to the specified URL, including the method, headers, and body. Sentry automatically adds `User-Agent` and `Sentry-Trace` headers.

Additional notes:

- Include a `Content-Type` header if required by the target URL. For example, a JSON payload should have `Content-Type: application/json`.
- The selected interval affects downtime detection speed. Sentry triggers an uptime issue after three consecutive failures. For instance, with a 5-minute interval, downtime is detected at least 15 minutes after the first failure. Learn more about the [uptime check criteria](/product/alerts/uptime-monitoring/#uptime-check-criteria).
- In case the specified URL is behind a firewall, make sure Sentry's Uptime Bot can execute requests to it. Learn more about [firewall configuration with uptime monitoring](/product/alerts/uptime-monitoring/troubleshooting/#verify-firewall-configuration).
- Sentry Uptime Tracing automatically appends a sentry-trace header to outgoing requests for distributed tracing. [Learn more](/product/alerts/uptime-monitoring/uptime-tracing/).

## 4. Alert Name

Give your alert a descriptive name, for example, "Landing Page" or "Contact Page".

## 5. Ownership

Assign a team or team member to manage the alert. If no team is assigned, any user can modify the alert. [Uptime issues](/product/issues/issue-details/uptime-issues/) created from this alert rule will be set to the specified team or team member.
