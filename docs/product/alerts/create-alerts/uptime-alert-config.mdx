<Include name="feature-stage-beta-uptime.mdx" />

Sentry provides several configuration options for creating an uptime alert based on your organization's needs as explained below.

## 1. Environment

First, specify which <PlatformLink to="/configuration/environments/">environment</PlatformLink> this alert rule belongs to. Any [uptime issues](/product/issues/issue-details/uptime-issues/) that will be created from this alert rule will then be set to your specified environment.

You'll notice that the “Environment” dropdown list you see here shows the same environments as the “Environment” dropdown in your project (not including hidden environments).

## 2. Project

Specify which project your alert rule belongs to so that any [uptime issues](/product/issues/issue-details/uptime-issues/) you create will show up for that specific project.

## 3. Request Configuration

Configure how Sentry should execute an HTTP uptime check, by specifying:

- **URL**: The URL for which Sentry should execute an uptime check request.
- **Method**: The request method used to execute the uptime check. Available options are `GET`, `POST`, `HEAD`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`, and `OPTIONS`.
- **Headers**: The request headers included in the uptime check request.
- **Body**: The body message to include in the uptime check request. (This is only available when the method is set to `POST`, `PUT`, and `PATCH`.)
- **Allow Sampling**: Enable "Allow Sampling" to let the Sentry SDK handle span sampling for requests. See the [distributed tracing with uptime](/product/alerts/uptime-monitoring/uptime-tracing/) docs for more detail.

Make sure to include a `Content-Type` header in your headers configuration in case the specified URL requires it. For example, a JSON message body would have a `Content-Type` header of `application/json`.

<Alert level="warning">

It’s common to configure HTTP headers with sensitive data, such as API tokens or personal information. Use caution when adding headers to avoid unintentionally storing or exposing sensitive data.

<Alert level="info">

If the specified URL is behind a firewall, make sure Sentry's Uptime Bot can execute requests to it. [Learn more](/product/alerts/uptime-monitoring/troubleshooting/#verify-firewall-configuration).

## 4. Alert Name

Give your alert a descriptive name, for example, "Landing Page" or "Contact Page".

## 5. Ownership

Lastly, choose a team to associate with your alert so that members of that team are able to edit the alert if they want to. Note, that you can only add teams that you're a member of. If no team is assigned, anyone will be able to edit the alert.
