## How to Get the Most Out of Sentry

There are three things we recommend you do to get the most out of Sentry:

- **Connect your codebase**, making sure you've also set up [source code management integrations](/organization/integrations/source-code-mgmt/) and [source maps](/product/sentry-basics/integrate-frontend/upload-source-maps/) (if applicable). This will allow Sentry to link errors and performance issues directly to the problematic line of code via readable stack traces and suspect commits.
- **Set up [alerts](/product/alerts/)** to make sure you know when things you care about are going wrong. You can choose to be alerted via one of our chat integrations like [Slack](/organization/integrations/notification-incidents/slack/) or [Discord](/organization/integrations/notification-incidents/discord/). Check out our [alert best practices](/product/alerts/best-practices/) to learn how to only get relevant notifications.
- **Customize [Discover](/product/explore/discover-queries/), [Dashboards](/product/dashboards/), and [queries](/product/explore/discover-queries/query-builder/)** to better control the kinds of insights you get when things are going wrong in your app. Lastly, create [custom tags](/concepts/search/searchable-properties/#custom-tags) tailored to your use case for more granular searching and querying.
