This step-by-step tutorial walks you through setting up Sentry in a React project to monitor errors in a frontend application. After completing this tutorial you'll be able to:

- Receive alerts when errors occur in your code
- View a readable stack trace with source code context
- View suspect commits and suggested assignees based on commit information and stack traces

This tutorial uses a [sample React application](https://github.com/getsentry/frontend-tutorial). You can follow along with the provided sample code or apply the same steps to your own project.
