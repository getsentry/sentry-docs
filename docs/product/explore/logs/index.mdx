## Overview

With Structured Logs, users can send text-based log information from their applications, whether frontend or backend, to Sentry. Once in Sentry, these logs can be viewed alongside relevant errors, searched by text-string, or searched using their individual parameters.

Not everything that you want to track in your application generates an error event. You might want to arbitrarily track information happening in your application for many reasons, such as:

- Debugging information like navigation actions, page interactions, or query results
- User specific events
- Configuration items that users or an application are receiving

## Set up Logs

To get started with Logs, navigate to the [Getting Started](/product/explore/logs/getting-started/) page and select your SDK from the list.

## Viewing and Searching Logs

**Raw Text Search**  
Raw text search is case sensitive and allows you to search for specific strings within the *message* attribute of the Log. **Raw text search over the entire log's JSON is not supported.**

**Default Properties Search**  
You can also search using the default properties (like `severity`) or additional custom properties that you've added to your log entries.

**Expand Logs**  
Log entries can be expanded to view all properties of logs entry. Individual properties can be added as columns to the results view, allowing you to quickly view properties that matter specifically to you alongside your search results.

**Auto-Refresh**  
You can also enable auto refreshing of the logs view to see your latest logs as they come in.

Conditions in which auto-refresh is disabled:

- Auto-refresh is only supported when sorting by time in descending order.
- Auto-refresh is only supported when using a relative time period, like "Last 15 minutes" or "Last 7 days", not absolute dates like "2025-07-23".
- Auto-refresh is disabled due to high data volume (100 logs per second). Try adding a filter to reduce the number of logs.
- Auto-refresh will be disabled due to reaching a max auto-refresh time of 10 minutes.
- Auto-refresh will be disabled if there is an error fetching logs.
- Auto-refresh is not available in the aggregates view.

### Query Volumes
When the number of logs returned by a query is too high, there are a couple of changes to explorer functionality.
 - Auto-refresh will be disabled.
 - Data shown in the chart will be extrapolated from a sampled amount of the complete dataset.

 When doing very specific queries, like looking for a particular line of code that is causing an issue, you may see a message that says "No logs found yet". This happens when the dataset is very large, and Sentry needs to batch the results. You can continue scanning to see the next batch of logs by clicking "Continue Scanning".

## Log based Alerts and Dashboard widgets

You can create Alert rules and dashboard widgets based on your log queries.

## AI-Powered Log Analysis

Your Sentry logs can be leveraged with AI agents and tooling for debugging, summarizing, and automated analysis.

- **[Sentry CLI](/cli/logs/)**: Provides command-line access to your logs, making it easy to feed log data directly into AI tools and scripts for analysis.
- **[Sentry MCP Server](/product/sentry-mcp/)**: Provides secure connectivity between your Sentry data and LLM clients using the Model Context Protocol. This enables natural language queries and deep integration with AI tools like Claude, Cursor, and VS Code.
- **[Seer](/product/ai-in-sentry/seer/)**: Sentry's AI debugging agent automatically uses logs alongside other telemetry data to provide intelligent issue analysis and automated fixes.
