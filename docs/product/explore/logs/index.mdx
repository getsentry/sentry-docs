<Alert title="Currently in beta">

Sentry Logs is currently in Beta. Features are still in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony. For any questions or feedback, you can reach us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/sentry) or [GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/discussions/86804).

## Overview

With Structured Logs, users can send text based log information from their applications, whether frontend or backend, to Sentry. Once in Sentry, these logs can be viewed alongside relevant errors, searched by text-string, or searched using their individual parameters.

Not everything that you want to track in your application generates an error event. You might want to arbitrarily track information happening in your application for many reasons, such as: 

- Debugging information like navigation actions, page interactions, or query results
- User specific events
- Configuration items that users or an application are receiving 

## Set up Logs

To get started with Logs, navigate to the [Gettting Started](/product/explore/logs/getting-started/) and select your SDK from the list.

## Viewing and Searching Logs 

Raw text search is case sensitive and allows you to search for specific strings within log entries.

You can also search using the default properties (like `severity`) or additional custom properties that you've added to your log entries.

Log entries can be expanded to view all properties of logs entry. Individual properties can be added as columns to the results view, allowing you to quickly view properties that matter specifically to you alongside your search results.
