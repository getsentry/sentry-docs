You've set up Sentry Logs. Now what? This guide covers the high-value logging patterns that help you debug faster and catch problems before users report them.

## The Pattern

Every structured log follows the same format:

```javascript
Sentry.logger.<level>(message, { attributes });
```

**Levels:** `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`

**Attributes:** Key-value pairs you can search and filter on. Use whatever naming convention fits your codebase—consistency matters more than specific names.

```javascript
Sentry.logger.info("Order completed", {
  orderId: "order_123",
  userId: user.id,
  amount: 149.99,
  paymentMethod: "stripe"
});
```

Every log is automatically trace-connected. Click any log entry to see the full trace, spans, and errors from that moment.

## Where to Add Logs

These five categories give you the most debugging value per line of code.

### 1. Authentication Events

Login flows are invisible until something breaks. Log successes and failures to spot patterns—brute force attempts, OAuth misconfigurations, or MFA issues.

```javascript
Sentry.logger.info("User logged in", {
  userId: user.id,
  authMethod: "oauth",
  provider: "google"
});

Sentry.logger.warn("Login failed", {
  email: maskedEmail,
  reason: "invalid_password",
  attemptCount: 3
});
```

**Search:** `userId:123 "logged in"` or `severity:warn authMethod:*`

**Alert idea:** `severity:warn "Login failed"` exceeding your baseline in 5 minutes can indicate brute force or auth provider issues.

### 2. Payment and Checkout

Money paths need visibility even when they succeed. When payments fail, you need context fast.

```javascript
Sentry.logger.error("Payment failed", {
  orderId: "order_123",
  amount: 99.99,
  gateway: "stripe",
  errorCode: "card_declined",
  cartItems: 3
});
```

**Search:** `orderId:order_123` or `severity:error gateway:stripe`

**Alert idea:** `severity:error gateway:*` spiking can indicate payment provider outages.

### 3. External APIs and Async Operations

Traces capture what your code does. Logs capture context about external triggers and async boundaries—webhooks, scheduled tasks, third-party API responses—that traces can't automatically instrument.

```javascript
// Third-party API call
const start = Date.now();
const response = await shippingApi.getRates(items);

Sentry.logger.info("Shipping rates fetched", {
  service: "shipping-provider",
  endpoint: "/rates",
  durationMs: Date.now() - start,
  rateCount: response.rates.length
});

// Webhook received
Sentry.logger.info("Webhook received", {
  source: "stripe",
  eventType: "payment_intent.succeeded",
  paymentId: event.data.object.id
});
```

**Search:** `service:shipping-provider durationMs:>2000` or `source:stripe`

**Alert idea:** `service:* durationMs:>3000` can catch third-party slowdowns before they cascade.

### 4. Background Jobs

Jobs run outside request context. Without logs, failed jobs are invisible until someone notices missing data.

```javascript
Sentry.logger.info("Job started", {
  jobType: "email-digest",
  jobId: "job_456",
  queue: "notifications"
});

Sentry.logger.error("Job failed", {
  jobType: "email-digest",
  jobId: "job_456",
  retryCount: 3,
  lastError: "SMTP timeout"
});
```

**Search:** `jobType:email-digest severity:error`

**Alert idea:** `severity:error jobType:*` spiking can indicate queue processing issues or downstream failures.

### 5. Feature Flags and Config Changes

When something breaks after a deploy, the first question is "what changed?" Logging flag evaluations and config reloads gives you that answer instantly.

```javascript
Sentry.logger.info("Feature flag evaluated", {
  flag: "new-checkout-flow",
  enabled: true,
  userId: user.id
});

Sentry.logger.warn("Config reloaded", {
  reason: "env-change",
  changedKeys: ["API_TIMEOUT", "MAX_CONNECTIONS"]
});
```

**Search:** `flag:new-checkout-flow` or `"Config reloaded"`

## Creating Alerts From Logs

1. Go to **Explore > Logs**
2. Enter your search query (e.g., `severity:error gateway:*`)
3. Click **Save As** → **Alert**
4. Choose a threshold type:
   - **Static:** Alert when count exceeds a value
   - **Percent Change:** Alert when count changes relative to a previous period
   - **Anomaly:** Let Sentry detect unusual patterns
5. Configure notification channels and save

## Production Logging Strategy

Local debugging often means many small logs tracing execution flow. In production, this creates noise that's hard to query.

Instead, log fewer messages with higher cardinality. Store events during execution and emit them as a single structured log.

**Don't do this:**

```javascript
Sentry.logger.info("Checkout started", { userId: "882" });
Sentry.logger.info("Discount applied", { code: "WINTER20" });
Sentry.logger.error("Payment failed", { reason: "Insufficient Funds" });
```

These logs are trace-connected, but searching for the error won't return the userId or discount code from the same transaction.

**Do this instead:**

```javascript
Sentry.logger.error("Checkout failed", {
  userId: "882",
  orderId: "order_pc_991",
  cartTotal: 142.50,
  discountCode: "WINTER20",
  paymentMethod: "stripe",
  errorReason: "Insufficient Funds",
  itemCount: 4
});
```

One log tells the whole story. Search for the error and get full context.

## Log Drains for Platform Logs

If you can't install the Sentry SDK or need platform-level logs (CDN, database, load balancer), use [Log Drains](/product/drains/).

**Platform drains:** Vercel, Cloudflare Workers, Heroku, Supabase

**Forwarders:** OpenTelemetry Collector, Vector, Fluent Bit, AWS CloudWatch, Kafka

## Quick Reference

| Category | Level | Key Attributes |

| External APIs | `info` | service, endpoint, durationMs |
| Background jobs | `info`/`error` | jobType, jobId, retryCount |
| Feature flags | `info` | flag, enabled, changedKeys |
