Every replay has a detailed view that contains the embedded video player and rich debugging context. Playing back the video will allow you to see every user interaction in relation to frontend and backend errors, console messages, DOM events, network requests and more. It’s like having [DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/overview/) active for your production user sessions. Almost every component on this page is connected through timestamps. See the breakdown of each component and why it’s valuable:

![Session Replay details user interface](./img/replay-details.png)

- **Replay Player:** Video-like reproduction of a user session. This is where you can visualize exactly what actions the user took during a user session and how the application behaved within this specific user’s environment, including device, OS, latency, settings, and so on. Most importantly, you can see which actions led to an error, which takes the guesswork out of debugging.
  - By default, the Session Replay SDK is configured to redact all text, user input, and media elements. See all privacy configuration options [here](/platform-redirect/?next=/session-replay/privacy/).

* **Breadcrumbs:** The replay breadcrumbs show when key user interactions took place. Breadcrumbs are synced with the replay player and will auto-scroll as the video plays. 
Specifically:
  - **User Clicks or Taps:** including rage and dead clicks on Web and React Native.
  - **Navigations, Page Loads & View Changes:** [Learn more about spans](/product/sentry-basics/distributed-tracing/)
  - **Mobile specific:** Backgrounding as well as foregrounding, network connectivity, and battery usage.
  - **Web Vitals:** and an overall Performance Score [Learn more](/product/insights/web-vitals/)
  - **Custom Breadcrumbs:** Learn more about configuring [custom breadcrumbs](/product/sentry-basics/integrate-backend/configuration-options/#breadcrumbs).

  Some [breadcrumb types](/product/issues/issue-details/breadcrumbs/) visible in **Issue Details** are not 1:1 to the replay breadcrumbs list. The trail of events typically seen in the Issue Details page are now displayed in the Console and Network components of the **Replay Details** page.  

- **Timeline:** This section at the bottom of the **Replay Details** page illustrates where significant events (such as errors, user interactions, and more) happen over the course of the replay. This allows users to easily scrub to key events by dragging across the timeline. It also visually conveys the amount of time that took place between events and has a zoom functionality, so you can easily zoom in to distinguish between events that happen close together.

* **Console:** A list of debugging messages that don't belong in the breadcrumbs list will appear here. For web, this includes `console.log` statements and browser-generated messages to the developer. For React Native, custom `console.log` will appear here, and in Android, logs from [Logcat](/platforms/android/integrations/logcat/) and [Timber](/platforms/android/integrations/timber/) are also supported.

- **Network:** A list of all network requests that were initiated by the app while the replay recording was active. As the video plays, there is a visual indicator that tracks through the table of network requests, highlighting which requests happened prior to or next to this point in the video. You can also click the timestamp on the far right of each request to bring yourself to that point in the replay player. If configured for web, Sentry can also show the actual [HTTP request body and headers](/platform-redirect/?next=/session-replay/configuration/#network-details).

- **Errors:** See all the errors that occurred in the replay (including in your backend), with links to the corresponding events and [issue(s)](/product/issues/issue-details/error-issues/), as well as the impact these issues have had holistically across all users on your application.

- **Trace:** Connects all the [trace(s)](/product/sentry-basics/tracing/distributed-tracing/#traces-transactions-and-spans) that happened during the replay.
  - Due to transaction sampling, this view may be missing traces.

- **Memory (web):** The view shows a heap size chart displaying the total amount of memory being used by JavaScript objects.
  - This view is only available when the replay was recorded on a Chromium-based browser.

- **Tags:** A complete list of built-in fields and custom tags associated with a replay, such as operating system version and name, device specs, release, and user details.


## Share Replays

Share a replay at a specific timestamp with a Sentry member by clicking the “Share” button in the top-right corner of the **Replay Details** page. This allows you to share replays at the point of a critical event or user flow with other Sentry members in your organization.

## Delete Replays

Delete an individual replay by clicking the “Delete” button in the top-right corner of **the Replay Details** page. You cannot delete replays that are in progress. Please note that deleting replays does not affect your quota.

## Tags

Find a complete list of built-in fields and custom tags associated with a replay under the “Tags” tab for additional context around the replay you’re viewing.

## Retention

Replays are retained for 90 days in Sentry for paid plans (the same retention period as other event types, such as Errors and Transactions). For free plans, replays are retained for 30 days in Sentry. The retention period is not configurable.

## Inbound Filtering

If you've chosen not to capture certain errors by applying any of the below inbound filter rules, those same rules will also apply to Session Replays.

- IP Addresses
- Releases
- Request URLs
- User-Agents

**Note**: Because filtered outcomes are emitted per **segment** whereas successful outcomes are emitted per **replay**  (a replay being a collection of segments), you may see a noticeable increase in filtered outcomes on your [Stats](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/stats) page. This is not an error.
