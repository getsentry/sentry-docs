  Learn how to restrict which users can view session replays using granular permissions and allowlists.
---

Restricting Session Replay access allows organization Managers and Owners to control who can view replays by creating an allowlist of authorized users. This feature provides an additional permission layer on top of existing role, team, and project permissions.

## How It Works

Restricting replay access works in conjunction with your existing Sentry permissions structure. When enabled, users must meet both requirements to view replays:

1. Have standard role/team/project permissions that would normally grant replay access
2. Be included in the replay allowlist

This means the allowlist adds an extra layer of security without replacing your existing permission model. If the feature is disabled, only standard Sentry permissions apply.

## Restricting Replay Access

Organization Managers and Owners can restrict replay access in the organization settings:

1. Navigate to **Settings > Organization Settings**
2. Locate the **Restrict Replay Access** setting
3. Toggle on the setting to enable replay access restrictions
4. Once enabled, you'll see an option to manage the allowlist

<Alert level="info">

Only organization Managers and Owners can enable this feature and manage the allowlist.

</Alert>

## Managing the Allowlist

After enabling replay access restrictions, you can specify which users are allowed to view replays:

### Adding Users to the Allowlist

1. In the **Restrict Replay Access** settings, click to add users
2. Select users from your organization's member list
3. Save your changes

Users added to the allowlist will be able to view replays (provided they also have the necessary role/team/project permissions).

### Removing Users from the Allowlist

1. In the **Restrict Replay Access** settings, find the user you want to remove
2. Click the remove button next to their name
3. Confirm the removal

Removed users will immediately lose access to viewing replays, even if they have other permissions that would normally grant access.

### Best Practices

- **Start with a small group**: When first enabling the feature, consider starting with a limited set of users and expanding gradually
- **Document your criteria**: Maintain clear internal documentation about who should be on the allowlist and why
- **Regular reviews**: Periodically review the allowlist to ensure it reflects current team needs
- **Communicate changes**: Let your team know when replay access is restricted and who to contact for access

## User Experience Without Permissions

When a user doesn't have replay access permissions, they'll experience the following:

- **Hidden UI components**: Replay-related buttons, menus, and navigation items won't be visible
- **Blocked API endpoints**: Direct API requests to replay endpoints will be denied
- **No replay data**: Replays won't appear in issue details or other contexts where they're normally shown

These restrictions apply throughout Sentry, including:
- The Session Replay section
- Replay links in issue details
- Replay references in traces
- AI-powered replay summaries

## Impact on AI Features

Restricting replay access also affects AI-powered features in Sentry:

### Seer Replay Summaries

Users without replay access permissions cannot use [Seer](/product/ai-in-sentry/seer/) to generate or view AI-powered replay summaries. This ensures that users can't circumvent replay restrictions by accessing replay data through AI features.

If you try to use Seer's replay summary feature without proper permissions, the feature will be unavailable.

<Alert level="warning">

AI features respect the same permission boundaries as direct replay access. Users on the allowlist can use all replay-related AI features, while users not on the allowlist cannot.
