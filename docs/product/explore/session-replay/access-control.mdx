  Learn how to control which users can view session replays using granular permissions and allowlists.
---

Session Replay access control allows organization Managers and Owners to restrict who can view replays by creating an allowlist of authorized users. This feature provides an additional permission layer on top of existing role, team, and project permissions.

## How It Works

Replay access control works in conjunction with your existing Sentry permissions structure. When enabled, users must meet both requirements to view replays:

1. Have standard role/team/project permissions that would normally grant replay access
2. Be included in the replay allowlist

This means the allowlist adds an extra layer of security without replacing your existing permission model. If the feature is disabled, only standard Sentry permissions apply.

**Permission Logic:**
```
Can View Replay = (Standard Role/Team/Project Permissions) AND (On Allowlist OR Feature Disabled)
```

## Enabling Replay Access Control

Organization Managers and Owners can enable replay access control in the organization settings:

1. Navigate to **Settings > Organization Settings**
2. Locate the replay access control settings
3. Toggle on the setting to enable replay access restrictions
4. Once enabled, you'll see an option to manage the allowlist

<Alert level="info">

Only organization Managers and Owners can enable this feature and manage the allowlist.

## Managing the Allowlist

After enabling replay access control, you can specify which users are allowed to view replays:

### Adding Users to the Allowlist

1. In the replay access control settings, click to add users
2. Select users from your organization's member list
3. Save your changes

Users added to the allowlist will be able to view replays (provided they also have the necessary role/team/project permissions).

### Removing Users from the Allowlist

1. In the replay access control settings, find the user you want to remove
2. Click the remove button next to their name
3. Confirm the removal

Removed users will immediately lose access to viewing replays, even if they have other permissions that would normally grant access.

### Best Practices

- **Start with a small group**: When first enabling the feature, consider starting with a limited set of users and expanding gradually
- **Document your criteria**: Maintain clear internal documentation about who should be on the allowlist and why
- **Regular reviews**: Periodically review the allowlist to ensure it reflects current team needs
- **Communicate changes**: Let your team know when replay access control is enabled and who to contact for access

## User Experience Without Permissions

When a user doesn't have replay access permissions, they'll experience the following:

- **Hidden UI components**: Replay-related buttons, menus, and navigation items won't be visible
- **Blocked API endpoints**: Direct API requests to replay endpoints will be denied
- **No replay data**: Replays won't appear in issue details or other contexts where they're normally shown

These restrictions apply throughout Sentry, including:
- The Session Replay section
- Replay links in issue details
- Replay references in traces
- AI-powered replay summaries

## Impact on AI Features

Replay access control also affects AI-powered features in Sentry:

### Seer Replay Summaries

Users without replay access permissions cannot use [Seer](/product/ai-in-sentry/seer/) to generate or view AI-powered replay summaries. This ensures that users can't circumvent replay restrictions by accessing replay data through AI features.

If you try to use Seer's replay summary feature without proper permissions, the feature will be unavailable.

<Alert level="warning">

AI features respect the same permission boundaries as direct replay access. Users on the allowlist can use all replay-related AI features, while users not on the allowlist cannot.

</Alert>

## Common Use Cases

Organizations typically use replay access control for:

### Compliance and Privacy

Replays can contain sensitive user information or personally identifiable information (PII). Restricting access helps organizations:
- Meet compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
- Limit exposure of sensitive customer data
- Implement principle of least privilege

### Cost Management

Since replays contribute to your Sentry quota usage, limiting who can view them can help:
- Control replay-related costs
- Focus replay access on teams that need it most
- Manage resource allocation across teams

### Security Policies

Some organizations have strict security requirements that mandate:
- Limited access to production user sessions
- Audit trails for who can view customer data
- Graduated access levels based on role seniority

### Trial and Beta Access

When rolling out Session Replay capabilities:
- Test with a small group before wider deployment
- Manage beta access for new replay features
- Control feature rollout pace

## Relationship to Other Permissions

Replay access control works alongside Sentry's existing permission model:

- **Organization-level roles**: Manager and Owner roles can manage the allowlist. All other roles must be on the allowlist to view replays (when enabled)
- **Team-level permissions**: Team membership still controls which projects and replays a user can access, but the allowlist adds an additional restriction
- **Project access**: Users must have access to a project through team membership and be on the allowlist to view that project's replays

For more information about Sentry's permission model, see [Organization and User Management](/organization/membership/).
