Sentry supports Session Replay for Web and Mobile. This includes browser-based applications and certain native mobile platforms, such as Android, iOS, and React Native. Both versions of Replay (Web and Mobile) are generally available and stable.

For browser-based applications (Web replay), this includes static websites, single-page applications, and also server-side rendered applications. This includes platforms such as Electron, Next.js, and Remix. The only prerequisite is that your application uses Sentry JavaScript SDK (version 7.2.0 or greater) either with NPM/Yarn or with our JS Loader script.

To learn more about which SDKs we support, please visit our docs for [Web](web/getting-started/#supported-sdks) and [Mobile](mobile/#sdks-supported).
