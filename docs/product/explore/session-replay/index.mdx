Sentry supports Session Replay for Web and Mobile. This includes browser-based applications and certain native mobile platforms, such as Android, iOS, and React Native. Both versions of Replay (Web and Mobile) are generally available and stable.

For browser-based applications, this includes static websites, single-page applications, and also server-side rendered applications -- for example, platforms such as Electron, Next.js, and Remix.
