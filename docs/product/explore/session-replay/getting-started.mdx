With Session Replay, Sentry users can get to the root of an error or performance issue faster, by watching a video-like reproduction of a user session and getting additional information such as what would appear in the developer tools of a client browser.

To get instructions for how to set it up and start sending replays, click a link for one of the supported SDKs below.

## Supported SDKs

Session Replay supports all browser-based applications.
This includes static websites, single-page-aplications and also server-side-rendered, that includes frameworks such as:
[Django](/platforms/python/integrations/django/),
[Spring](/platforms/java/guides/spring-boot/),
[ASP.NET](/platforms/dotnet/guides/aspnetcore/),
[Laravel](/platforms/php/guides/laravel/),
[Express](/platforms/javascript/guides/express/) and
[Rails](/platforms/ruby/guides/rails/).
If you don't use `npm` or `yarn`, you can use [our Loader `script` tag](/platforms/javascript/install/loader/) on your main HTML template.

The Sentry SDK that records the replay runs on the client's browser, and itâ€™s built-in to `@sentry/browser` and our browser framework SDKs:

- [Vanilla JavaScript](/platforms/javascript/session-replay/)
- [Angular](/platforms/javascript/guides/angular/session-replay/)
- [Astro](/platforms/javascript/guides/astro/session-replay/)
- [Capacitor](/platforms/javascript/guides/capacitor/session-replay/)
- [Electron](/platforms/javascript/guides/electron/session-replay/)
- [Ember](/platforms/javascript/guides/ember/session-replay/)
- [Gatsby](/platforms/javascript/guides/gatsby/session-replay/)
- [Next.js](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/session-replay/)
- [React](/platforms/javascript/guides/react/session-replay/)
- [Remix](/platforms/javascript/guides/remix/session-replay/)
- [Svelte](/platforms/javascript/guides/svelte/session-replay/)
- [SvelteKit](/platforms/javascript/guides/sveltekit/session-replay/)
- [Vue](/platforms/javascript/guides/vue/session-replay/)

## Replays for Backend Errors

Replays are integrated with Sentry's tracing data model, enabling you to see replays associated with backend errors. For these replays, you'll be able to view backend errors in the Timeline, Breadcrumbs, Errors tab, and other places when you go to the **Replay Details** view. You'll also see a Replays tab and replay previews in the **Issue Details** page for any backend error that has a linked replay.

To see replays for backend errors, you need to have Sentry set up for both your frontend and backend, along with [distributed tracing](/product/sentry-basics/concepts/tracing/). This provides end-to-end data connectivity on your APIs, allowing Sentry to link replays to backend endpoints. Make sure you've set up trace propagation in your backend projects. For example:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  tracePropagationTargets: [
    "third-party-site.com",
    /^https:\/\/yourserver\.io\/api/,
  ],
});
```
