Enabling a feature flag integration gives you deep insights into the state of your application prior to failure. A list of flags and their evaluation results are displayed on each error event. Integrating Sentry with your feature flag provider enables Sentry to correlate feature flag changes with new error events and mark certain changes as suspicious.

## Evaluation Tracking

Flag evaluations will appear in the "Feature Flag" section of Issue Details page as a table, with "suspect" flag predictions highlighted in yellow. Learn more about how to interact with feature flag insights within the Sentry UI by reading the [Issue Details docs](/product/issues/issue-details/#feature-flags/).

### Set Up Evaluation Tracking

To set up evaluation tracking visit your provider's integration documentation page:
* [JavaScript](/platforms/javascript/feature-flags/)
* [Python](/platforms/python/feature-flags/)

## Change Tracking

Change tracking enables Sentry to listen for updates to your feature flags' definitions. On change, we'll record the event in an audit log. The audit log appears in the "event volume" chart and presents itself as a "release" line. If the change is responsible for a new error event, we'll notify you by marking the feature flag as "suspect" on the issue details page. Learn more about how to interact with feature flag insights within the Sentry UI by reading the [Issue Details page documentation](/product/issues/issue-details/#feature-flags/).
