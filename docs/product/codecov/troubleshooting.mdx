**Why don't my stack traces have test coverage data?**

- You may not have a coverage report for the file you're interested in. Check [Codecov](https://about.codecov.io/) to make sure a coverage report exists.

- You may not have [Source Code Coverage](https://about.codecov.io/product/feature/source-code-coverage/) enabled.
