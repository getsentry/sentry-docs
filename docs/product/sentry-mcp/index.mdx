<Alert>
  The Sentry MCP Server is currently in **beta**. Beta features are still a work in progress and may have bugs. Please reach out on
  [GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-mcp/issues) if you have any feedback or concerns.
</Alert>

## Overview

The [Sentry MCP Server](https://mcp.sentry.dev) provides a secure way of bringing Sentry's full issue context into systems that are able to leverage the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction). Sentry hosts and manages a remote MCP server, which you can connect to and leverage centrally. With the MCP, you can:

- Access Sentry issues and errors
- Search for errors in specific files
- Query projects and organizations
- List and create Sentry DSN's for projects
- Execute autofix runs and retrieve autofix status and details

## Getting Started

Most clients that natively support MCP can be configured using a mcp_config.json file or an equivalent. In these systems, adding the server configuration to the file will setup an MCP server: 

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "Sentry": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": [
                "mcp-remote",
                "https://mcp.sentry.dev/sse"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

This setup uses the Remote-MCP server configuration, enabling most clients to connect to the Sentry MCP, authenticate via OAuth, and access the available tools.

Alternatively, if you don't want the Remote-MCP server, you can run the MCP Server locally in STDIO mode by following the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-mcp).

Once configured via one of these methods, you'll be able to view the available tools within your client and use them as part of your LLM calls.

## Example Calls 

- Tell me about the issues in my `project`
- Check Sentry for errors in `file.tsx` and propose solutions.
- Diagnose issue `issue id` and propose solutions.
- Create a new project in Sentry for `service-name` and setup local instrumentation using it.
- Use Sentry's autofix feature, and help me analyze and propose a solution for `issue id`.
