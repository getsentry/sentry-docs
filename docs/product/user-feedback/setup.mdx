With User Feedback, you can collect feedback from your users via three methods:
1. A Feedback Widget that can be displayed anywhere in your application (various SDKs and loader script)
2. A Crash-Report Modal that pops up automatically when your users experience a crash (HTML script)
3. An API that you can attach to your own interface (various SDKs and web API)

To get instructions for how to set it up and start collecting feedback, click a link for one of the supported SDKs below.

## Supported SDKs for User Feedback Widget

The User Feedback widget can be used on all browser-based applications. This includes static websites, single-page-applications, and also server-side-rendered, including frameworks such as:
[Django](/platforms/python/integrations/django/),
[Spring](/platforms/java/guides/spring-boot/),
[ASP.NET](/platforms/dotnet/guides/aspnetcore/),
[Laravel](/platforms/php/guides/laravel/),
[Express](/platforms/javascript/guides/express/) and
[Rails](/platforms/ruby/guides/rails/).
If you don't use `npm` or `yarn`, you can use [our Loader `script` tag](/platforms/javascript/install/loader/) on your main HTML template.

The Sentry SDK that injects the Feedback widget runs on the client's browser, and itâ€™s built-in to `@sentry/browser` and our browser framework SDKs:

- [Vanilla JavaScript](/platforms/javascript/user-feedback/)
- [Angular](/platforms/javascript/guides/angular/user-feedback/)
- [Astro](/platforms/javascript/guides/astro/user-feedback/)
- [Capacitor](/platforms/javascript/guides/capacitor/user-feedback/)
- [Electron](/platforms/javascript/guides/electron/user-feedback/)
- [Ember](/platforms/javascript/guides/ember/user-feedback/)
- [Gatsby](/platforms/javascript/guides/gatsby/user-feedback/)
- [Next.js](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/user-feedback/)
- [React](/platforms/javascript/guides/react/user-feedback/)
- [Remix](/platforms/javascript/guides/remix/user-feedback/)
- [Svelte](/platforms/javascript/guides/svelte/user-feedback/)
- [SvelteKit](/platforms/javascript/guides/sveltekit/user-feedback/)
- [Vue](/platforms/javascript/guides/vue/user-feedback/)

## Crash Report Modal

The Crash Report Modal allows users to submit feedback after they experience an error, via an automatic modal that pops up after an error occurs. This is done by adding a script tag to your HTML template.

[JavaScript](/platforms/javascript/user-feedback/#crash-report-modal)
[PHP](/platforms/php/user-feedback/#crash-report-modal)

## Supported SDKs for User Feedback API

We also provide an API to send user feedback programmatically. This allows you to connect your own user interface to Sentry. If your SDK is not supported, you may post data to the [Web API](https://docs.sentry.io/api/projects/submit-user-feedback/).

The following SDKs are supported:
- [Android](/platforms/android/user-feedback/#user-feedback-api)
- [Apple](/platforms/apple/user-feedback/#user-feedback-api)
- [Dart](/platforms/dart/user-feedback/#user-feedback-api)
- [.NET](/platforms/dotnet/user-feedback/#use-the-net-sdk)
- [Flutter](/platforms/dart/guides/flutter/user-feedback/#user-feedback-api)
- [Java](/platforms/java/user-feedback/#user-feedback-api)
- [Kotlin](/platforms/kotlin/guides/kotlin-multiplatform/user-feedback/#user-feedback-api)
- [Node.JS](/platforms/javascript/guides/node/user-feedback/#user-feedback-api)
- [React Native](/platforms/react-native/user-feedback/#user-feedback-api)
- [Unity](/platforms/unity/user-feedback/#use-the-net-sdk)
- [Unreal](/platforms/unreal/user-feedback/#user-feedback-api)
