The **Project Details** page provides a consolidated view of various project metrics for the selected time range (14 days by default).

The top four cards display the following:

- Crash free [sessions](/product/releases/health/#session)
- Crash free users
- Number of [releases](/product/releases/)
- [Apdex](/product/performance/metrics/#apdex)

The two graphs below the cards show the value of a specific metric over the specified time range. Click on the graph legend to show or hide an overlay of the previous time period and any releases (if set up).

- [Failure rate](/product/performance/metrics/#failure-rate)
- [Transactions per minute](/product/performance/metrics/#throughput-total-tpm-tps)
- Number of errors
- Number of sessions
- Number of transactions

You can also use this page to set up [alerts](/product/alerts-notifications/) or [triage an issue](#triage).
