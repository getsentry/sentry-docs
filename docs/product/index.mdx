## What's Sentry?

Sentry is a software monitoring tool that helps developers identify and debug performance issues and errors. From end-to-end distributed tracing to performance monitoring, Sentry provides code-level observability that makes it easy to diagnose issues and learn continuously about your application code health across systems and services.

## What Can Sentry Help With?

As a full-stack application monitoring solution, Sentry provides the following features to help you keep your app running smoothly and your users happy.

### Error Monitoring

Sentry's error monitoring capabilities make it possible to quickly get to the root of a problem so you can understand and fix what's broken.

Sentry automatically captures unhandled exceptions (errors). It then groups similar errors into [issues](/product/issues/), making it possible to triage and manage them more efficiently.

- If you're monitoring a web project, you can [**replay**](/product/explore/session-replay/) what the user experienced on your app and connect that error to the problematic line of code with [**source maps**](/product/sentry-basics/integrate-frontend/upload-source-maps/).
- If you set up Sentry for both your frontend and backend, you'll be able to use [**distributed tracing**](/product/sentry-basics/concepts/tracing/distributed-tracing/) to see the sequence of events (both frontend and backend) that led up to the event of interest.
- Additionally, you can set up [**integrations**](/organization/integrations/source-code-mgmt/) to link your source code so that Sentry can surface [**suspect commits**](/product/issues/suspect-commits/) and [**stack traces**](/organization/integrations/source-code-mgmt/github/#stack-trace-linking) to show the problematic line of code, as well as [**suggest assignees**](/organization/integrations/source-code-mgmt/github/#suspect-commits-and-suggested-assignees) for issues based on commit authors.

### Tracing

Tracing gives you a full view of what's happening in your application from the frontend to the backend and between systems, by looking at interactions between various components of your stack. This is especially useful if you rely on microservices or are trying to find the root cause of a difficult user complaint. With [distributed tracing](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/distributed-tracing/), you can quickly identify performance bottlenecks.

You can also get full context about what was happening when an error or performance issue occurred by looking at the [Trace View](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/trace-view/) page. This will allow you to among other things, trace slow-loading pages all the way back to poor-performing API calls. Lastly, you can use the [Trace Explorer](/product/explore/traces/) page to search span data, including conditions relating to the structure of the trace itself.

### Profiling

Sentry [**Profiling**](/product/profiling/) provides code-level insights into your application performance in production so you can find and fix problematic lines of code faster. You can profile code in any environment your application is running on so you can quickly see which functions are causing a slow span.

### Performance Monitoring

Our performance monitoring feature helps you track application performance, measure metrics like throughput and latency, and see the impact of errors across multiple services.

- Sentry helps you discover and act on [**trends**](/product/performance/trends/) before they become a bigger problem by surfacing transactions whose performance has changed significantly over time.
- Sentry provides insights to help you monitor your app's performance. This includes web vitals, mobile vitals, queries, HTTP requests, and more. You can drill into event samples to investigate variations in performance.


### Release Health Monitoring

Giving Sentry visibility into your [**releases**](/product/releases/) makes it possible to see the moment a release starts to degrade so you can quickly take action. You get real-time visibility across your releases, allowing you to see core metrics like crash-free sessions, version adoption, and failure rate.

Releases are integrated with the rest of Sentry so you can directly see how an error or performance issue was affected by a release, in addition to being able to resolve release-specific issues.

### LLM Monitoring

Our [**LLM Monitoring**](/product/insights/llm-monitoring/) feature gives you insights into your AI pipelines within the broader context of your app. When you `pip install sentry` into a project that's also using an AI provider like OpenAI, Sentry will automatically pick up useful metrics like token usage, prompts, and model IDs, and send them to our LLM Monitoring dashboard.

### Recurring Job Monitoring

[**Cron Monitors**](/product/crons/) allows you to monitor the uptime and performance of any scheduled, recurring job in Sentry. Once implemented, it'll allow you to get alerts and metrics to help you solve errors, detect timeouts, and prevent disruptions to your service.

### Visibility Into Your Data Across Environments

[**Discover**](/product/explore/discover-queries/) provides visibility into your data across environments by building upon and enriching your error data. You can [**query**](/product/explore/discover-queries/query-builder/) and unlock insights into the health of your entire system and get answers to critical business questions â€” all in one place. You can also build your own [**dashboards**](/product/dashboards/) to help you monitor what's most important for your app.

### Code Coverage

[Codecov](/product/codecov/) provides **test code coverage** for developers. It helps improve testing, coverage, and code reliability, allowing you to get test coverage insights directly in Sentry while monitoring your errors.

### Seamless Developer Workflow

Sentry provides many [**integrations**](/organization/integrations/) to support a seamless developer workflow, including:

- [Source code management](/organization/integrations/source-code-mgmt/), code mapping, code owners, and suspect commits with GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps, and Bitbucket.
- [Issue tracking](/organization/integrations/issue-tracking/) with Jira, Github, and many other tools.
- [Alerts and notifications](/organization/integrations/notification-incidents/) with Slack, Discord, PagerDuty, and more.

### SDK Support for Over 100 Platforms

Sentry supports over [100 platforms and frameworks](/platforms/), including 30+ coding languages, so you can track errors and performance issues no matter what your application is built on. Our SDKs have you covered so you can get started with Sentry in just a few lines of code.
