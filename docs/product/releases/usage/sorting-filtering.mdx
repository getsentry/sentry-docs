## Sorting Releases

On the **Releases** page, you can use the "Sort By" dropdown to sort releases by:

- Date Created
- Total Sessions
- [Active Sessions/Users](/product/releases/health/#active-sessionsusers)
- [Crash Free Sessions/Users](/product/releases/health/#crash-free-sessionsusers)
- Build Number
- [Semantic Version](/platform-redirect/?next=/configuration/releases/%23bind-the-version)
- Date Adopted (when you select a single environment)

## Filtering Releases

Search on the **Releases** page supports both raw text and query syntax, and you can search using the following properties:

- `release` - Search based on string comparison, or `release:latest` to pick the most recent release. [Learn more](#latest-release).
- `release.stage` - Search releases with matching adoption stage. Can be `adopted`, `low_adoption`, or `replaced`. Learn more about [release adoption stages](/product/releases/health/#adoption-stages).

If you are using our [semantic versioning](/platform-redirect/?next=/configuration/releases/%23bind-the-version) format, you can use the following query tokens:

- `release.package` - Search releases with matching package names.
- `release.version` - Search releases with matching semantic version. Supports ranges and wildcards (for example, `release.version:>7.8` or `release.version:1.2.*`).
- `release.build` - Search releases with matching build numbers.

Learn more about search queries in our [full Search documentation](/concepts/search/).

## Latest Release

The special `release:latest` filter intelligently finds the most recent release for every selected project. For projects that use [Semantic Version](/platform-redirect/?next=/configuration/releases/%23bind-the-version) numbers, the latest release is one with the highest version number. For projects that use Commit SHA for versioning, the latest release is the most recent one.
