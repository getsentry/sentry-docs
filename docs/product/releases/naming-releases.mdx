## Creating Releases

Releases are created directly via [automatic release management](/product/releases/setup/release-automation/), the [Sentry CLI](/cli/releases/), or manually via the [Sentry API](/api/releases/create-a-new-release-for-an-organization/).

Releases can also be auto-created by different systems—for instance, upon uploading a source map, or by some clients when an event that is tagged with a release is ingested. Therefore, it's important to set the release name when building and deploying your application. Learn more in our [Releases](/platform-redirect/?next=/configuration/releases/) documentation.

## Release Names

Release IDs (often called a "version" or "name") are used to uniquely identify a release across the entire Sentry organization. A release name may be associated with builds, events, sessions, etc. from multiple projects. 

<Alert>

Releases are global per organization; prefix them with something project-specific for easy differentiation.

</Alert>

The value can be arbitrary, but there are a few restrictions. In all cases, the release name cannot:
- contain newlines, tabulator characters, forward slashes (`/`) or back slashes (`\`)
- be (in their entirety) period (`.`), double period (`..`), or space ( )
- exceed 200 characters

While the value can be arbitrary, we do recommend these naming strategies:

### Semantic Versioning
Use the format `package@version` or `package@version+build` (for example, `my.project.name@2.3.12+1234`)
- `package` is the unique identifier of the project/app (`CFBundleIdentifier` on iOS, `packageName` on Android)
- `version` is the semver-like structure `<major>.<minor?>.<patch?>.<revision?>-<prerelease?>` (`CFBundleShortVersionString` on iOS, `versionName` on Android)
- `build` is the number that identifies an iteration of your app (`CFBundleVersion` on iOS, `versionCode` on Android)
**Do not** use `VERSION_NUMBER (BUILD_NUMBER)` as the parenthesis are used for display purposes (foo@1.0+2 becomes 1.0 (2)), so invoking them will cause an error.

We automatically detect whether a project is using semantic or time-based versioning based on:

- If ≤ 2 releases total: we look at most recent release.
- If 3-9 releases (inclusive): if any of the most recent 3 releases is semver, project is semver (i.e., semantic versioning).
- If 10 or more releases: if any of the most recent 3 releases is semver, and 3 out of the most recent 10 releases is semver, then the project is semver.

### Commit SHA
If you use a version control system like Git, we recommend using the identifying hash (for example, the commit SHA, `da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709`). You can let Sentry CLI automatically determine this hash for supported version control systems, and pass it in at build time to your codebase so it can be used to tag events.

Regression Detection and `release:latest` sorting strategies will changed depending on whether a project is using semantic or SHA/time-based versioning.
