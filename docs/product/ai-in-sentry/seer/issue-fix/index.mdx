**Issue Fix** is Seer's collaborative workflow to find the root cause of and solution to issues. It uses Sentry's context (issue details, tracing data, logs, and profiles), your codebases (integrated through GitHub), and its interactions with you to identify and reason through problems in your code.

<Alert>
Issue Fix replace Suggested Fix (an earlier feature that has been sunset) and builds upon the capabilities previously known as Autofix.

## How Issue Fix Works

When you start an Issue Fix run, you'll see the following screen, with an option to share any additional context:

Issue Fix will then analyze the issue and relevant code to help identify the root cause and a solution. You'll see a live stream of Seer's thought process in real time as it works through the problem. Seer will share key insights as they come up and you'll have the option to expand each. You'll see the event data and code that support Seer's conclusions, building a clear chain of reasoning back to the root cause.

While Issue Fix is reasoning through your problem, you can step in to add context or feedback; collaboration tends to lead to the best results. If Issue Fix encounters gaps in its understanding, it will ask for your input.

The output will be a clearly defined root cause of the Sentry issue, and a detailed solution for how to resolve it:

You are free to edit or adjust this solution based on your own requirements and preferences. Once you are ready to proceed, you can select "Code It Up" to generate code resolving the bug. From there you'll have three options:

- Write a fix
- Write a unit test reproducing the issue
- Write both

Once the coding step is complete, you can either create a Pull Request (PR) in GitHub directly from Seer, or create a branch and checkout the code locally if you would like to iterate further.

## Prerequisites

To use Issue Fix, you'll need to have the following:

1. A Sentry project with issues that have sufficient context (issue details, tracing data, logs, and profiles).

2. GitHub integration set up in your Sentry project. This allows Seer to access your codebase and generate code fixes. See the [Sentry GitHub integration](/organization/integrations/source-code-mgmt/github/) to learn more.

3. Working knowledge of the issue you want to fix. Seer will help you identify the root cause and suggest a solution, but you should have a general understanding of the problem you're trying to solve.
