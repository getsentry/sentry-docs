Seer is Sentry's AI debugging agent that powers a set of features built on generative AI and ML that uses Sentry's rich context (issue details, tracing data, logs, and profiles) to help you troubleshoot and fix errors and performance issues faster.

## Seer Capabilities

Seer provides two main capabilities to enhance your debugging:

- [**Issue Fix**](#issue-fix): A collaborative workflow to find the root cause and solution of issues
- **Issue Scan**: Intelligently analyzes your issues and provides actionability scores to help you prioritize what to work on.

### Issue Fix

Issue Fix uses AI to find the root cause of your issues and suggest solutions. WIth Issue Fix, you can:

- Get automated root cause analysis using Sentry's context and your codebase
- Receive AI-generated code fixes and unit tests
- Collaborate with Seer throughout the debugging process
- Create pull requests directly from the Seer Interface
- Benefit from Github integration for seamless code changes

### Issue Scan

Issue Scan intelligently analyzes your issues and helps you prioritize what to work on. With Issue Scan, you can:

- Filter issues by their latest scan results
- View actionability scores that indicate how likely an issue is to be resolvable
- Se Seer labels in the issue stream for quick identification
- Get insights into which issues need immediate attention
- Enable Seer's Issue Fix to be started automatically once an issue is ingested in Sentry

## How Seer Works

Seer leverages multiple data sources to provide accurate analysis and solutions:

- **Issue Context**: Error messages, stack traces, and event metadata from your [Issues](/product/issues/)
- **Tracing Data**: Distributed [traces](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/#whats-a-trace) and span information
- **Your Codebase**: Relevant code from linked GitHub repositories and [logs](/product/explore/logs/)
- **Performance Data**: Profiles and performance metrics
- **Interactive Feedback**: Your input and guidance during the process

## Getting Started with Seer

To start using Seer's capabilities:

1. **Enable Seer**: Make sure AI features are enabled in your [organization settings](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/settings/#hideAiFeatures)
2. **Set up GitHub Integration**: For Issue Fix capabilities, [connect your GitHub repositories](/organization/integrations/source-code-mgmt/github/)
3. **Configure Settings**: Customize Seer's behavior in your project settings
4. **Start Using**: Look for Seer options in your issue details pages

## Data Processing for Generative AI

We use the data listed below to provide insights, analysis, and solutions for your review. Your data will not be used to train any generative AI models without your express consent and AI-generated output from your data is shown only to you, not other customers. Our generative AI features are powered by generative AI models hosted by subprocessors identified on our [subprocessor list](https://sentry.io/legal/subprocessors/). Our subprocessors are only permitted to use the data as directed by us.

The data used for these features includes:

- Error messages
- Stack traces
- Sentry spans
- DOM interactions
- Logs
- Profiles
- Relevant code from linked repositories

You can learn more about our data privacy practices [here](/security-legal-pii/security/ai-ml-policy/#use-of-identifying-data-for-generative-ai-features).

## Disabling Generative AI Features

If you don't find Seer useful and want to disable it for all users, you can do so in your organization's settings with the ["Show Generative AI Features" toggle](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/settings/#hideAiFeatures).
