Seer is Sentry's AI debugging agent. It includes a set of features, built on generative AI, that use Sentry's rich context (issue details, tracing data, logs, and profiles) to help you troubleshoot and fix errors and performance issues faster.

## Seer Capabilities

Seer provides two main capabilities to enhance your debugging:

- [**Issue fix**](#issue-fix): A collaborative workflow to find the root cause and solution of errors and performance issues.
- **Issue scan**: Intelligently analyzes your issues and provides actionability scores to help you prioritize what to work on.

### Issue Fix

Issue fix uses AI to find the root cause of your apps' issues and suggest solutions. With issue fix, you can:

- Get an accurate root cause analysis, using Sentry's context and your codebases
- Receive suggested code fixes and unit tests
- Collaborate with Seer throughout the debugging process
- Create pull requests directly from the Seer interface

### Issue Scan

Issue scan intelligently analyzes your issues and helps you prioritize what to work on. With issue scan, you can:

- View actionability scores that indicate how likely an issue is to be fixable with a code change, manually or with Seer's issue fix
- Enable Seer's issue fix to be started automatically once an issue is ingested in Sentry
- Filter issues by their latest scan results
- See Seer labels in the issue stream for quick identification
- Get insights into which issues need immediate attention

## How Seer Works

Seer leverages multiple data sources to provide accurate analysis and solutions:

- **Issue Context**: Error messages, stack traces, and event metadata from your [Issues](/product/issues/)
- **Tracing Data**: Distributed [traces](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/#whats-a-trace) and span information
- **Logs**: Structured [Logs](/product/explore/logs/) from your application (beta)
- **Your Codebase**: Relevant code from linked GitHub repositories, with support for multiple repos for distributed services
- **Performance Data**: Profiles and performance metrics
- **Interactive Feedback**: Your input and guidance during the process

## Getting Started with Seer

To start using Seer's capabilities:

1. **Enable Seer**: Make sure AI features are enabled in your [organization settings](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/settings/#hideAiFeatures)
2. **Set up GitHub Integration**: For issue fix capabilities, [connect your GitHub repositories](/organization/integrations/source-code-mgmt/github/)
3. **Configure Settings**: Customize Seer's behavior in your project settings
4. **Start Using**: Look for Seer options in your issue details pages

## Privacy and security

Sentry includes strong guarantees for privacy and security of your data. At a glance:

- Sentry does not train generative AI models using your data by default and without your permission.
- AI-generated output is shown only to you and other authorized users in your account.
