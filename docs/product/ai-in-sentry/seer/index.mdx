Seer is Sentry's AI debugging agent. It uses Sentry's rich context (issue details, tracing data, logs, and profiles) to help you troubleshoot and fix errors and performance issues faster.

## Seer Capabilities

Seer provides end-to-end debugging tools to help you troubleshoot and fix errors and performance issues faster, often before they are even merged:

- [**AI Code Review**](#ai-code-review): Have Seer review your code changes in GitHub, catching bugs before merging pull requests.
- [**Root Cause Analysis**](#root-cause-analysis): Automatically scans issues as they come in, feeding additional context to your alerts and automating triage
- [**PR Creation**](#pr-creation): A collaborative agent skilled at root cause analysis and solving issues
- [**Delegate to Background Agents**](#background-agents): Send Seer's analysis to Cursor's background agent to debug directly in your IDE

### AI Code Review

[AI Code Review](/product/ai-in-sentry/seer/ai-code-review/) helps you reviews your code changes, predicting errors and offering suggestions for improvement before merging pull requests. This feature is only available on GitHub.

### Root Cause Analysis

Seer is able to automatically analyze issues as they are ingested by Sentry by combining all of the relevant context from your code with Sentry's telemetry data to provide a best-in-class issue debugging experience. This initial review is used to:

- Determine if the issue can be automatically analyzed and fixed using Seer's Root Cause Analysis
- Augment issue alerts with a helpful analysis about the problem
- Add an initial guess for what the potential problem is to the issue details page

Once the Root Cause Analysis has run, Seer will provide remediatiion recommendations.

### PR Creation

You can prompt Seer to generate PRs to fix your issue, and push it to GitHub. You can add more context in natural language, or any external supporting information, to help Seer generate a better PR. **Note:** You must install the [Seer GitHub app](/organization/integrations/source-code-mgmt/github/#installing-the-seer-github-app) to use this feature.

### Background Agents

You can send Seer's root cause analysis to Cursor for further debugging directly in your IDE. 

## What Seer Uses

Seer is a powerful debugging agent, with access to a wide variety of data sources and tools. While debugging issues, it may examine:

- **Issue Context**: Error messages, stack traces, and event metadata from your [Issues](/product/issues/)
- **Tracing Data**: Distributed [traces](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/#whats-a-trace) and span information
- **Logs**: Structured [Logs](/product/explore/logs/) from your application (beta)
- **Your Codebase**: Relevant code from linked GitHub repositories, with support for multiple repos for distributed services
- **Performance Data**: Profiles and performance metrics
- **Interactive Feedback**: Your input and guidance during the process

## Getting Started with Seer

To start using Seer's capabilities in your Sentry-enabled projects, follow these steps:

1. Connect to GitHub through the [Sentry GitHub integration](/organization/integrations/source-code-mgmt/github/). You can follow the steps in [Seer settings](https://sentry.io/settings/seer/) to get started. **Note:** Seer can only be integrated with the cloud version of GitHub

2. Select which repositories you want Seer to have access to

3. Select which features to turn on - AI Code Review, Root Cause Analysis, PR generation of fixes

<Alert level="warning">

Seer is an add-on to your Sentry subscription. By enabling it, you are signing up for seat-based pricing for this feature. Any person who opens 2 or more PRs in a month in a Seer-enabled project will be billed. You can learn more about Seer pricing [here](/pricing/#seer-pricing).

## Privacy and security

Sentry includes strong guarantees for privacy and security of your data. At a glance:

- Sentry does not train generative AI models using your data by default and without your permission.
- AI-generated output is shown only to you and other authorized users in your account.

You can learn more about our data privacy practices [in the security and legal docs](/security-legal-pii/security/ai-ml-policy/#use-of-identifying-data-for-generative-ai-features).

## Turn Seer Off or On Globally

You can turn Seer off or on globally by going to [Seer settings](https://sentry.io/settings/seer/) and selecting from the dropdown at the top of the table in each tab.
