Sentry leverages artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to enhance your debugging and monitoring experience. Our AI-powered features help you understand issues faster, get automated fixes, and gain deeper insights into your application's behavior.

## AI-Powered Features

### [Seer](/product/ai-in-sentry/seer/)

Seer is Sentry's AI debugging agent that helps resolve errors and performance issues in your applications. Seer combines issue detection, analysis, and automated fixing capabilities to streamline your debugging workflow.

- **[Issue Fix](/product/ai-in-sentry/seer/issue-fix/)**: Automated root cause analysis and suggested code fixes, for errors and performance issues.
- **Issue Scan**: Scans issues as they are ingested in Sentry to determine an actionability score and run Seer's issue fix on them automatically.

### Issue Summary

**Issue summary** provides a quick overview of an issue by highlighting key insights taken from event and issue-level metadata. You'll see a quick overview of what's going wrong, a potential cause, and if relevant, insights from trace-connected issues.

### [Sentry Prevent AI](/product/ai-in-sentry/sentry-prevent-ai/)

Sentry Prevent AI is a generative AI assistant developed by Sentry, available in GitHub. It helps you generate new tests for uncovered code and reviews your code changes, offering suggestions for improvement before merging pull requests.

## Privacy and security

Sentry includes strong guarantees for privacy and security of your data. At a glance:

- Sentry does not train generative AI models using your data by default and without your permission.
- AI-generated output is shown only to you and other authorized users in your account.

You can get more details at [AI Privacy and Security](/product/ai-in-sentry/ai-privacy-and-security/). To learn more about all our data privacy practices go toÂ [the security and legal docs](/security-legal-pii/security/ai-ml-policy/#use-of-identifying-data-for-generative-ai-features).

## Disabling Generative AI Features

If you don't find Seer and other generative AI features useful and want to disable them for all users, you can do so in your organization's settings with the ["Show Generative AI Features" toggle](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/settings/#hideAiFeatures).
