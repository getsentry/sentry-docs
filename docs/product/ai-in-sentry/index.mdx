Sentry leverages artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to enhance your debugging and monitoring experience. Our AI-powered features help you understand issues faster, get automated fixes, and gain deeper insights into your application's behavior. 

## AI-Powered Features

### Seer

[Seer](/product/ai-in-sentry/seer/) is Sentry's AI debugging agent that helps resolve errors and performance issues in your applications. Seer combines issue detection, analysis, and automated fixing capabilities to streamline your debugging workflow. Seer is an [add-on](/pricing/#seer-pricing) to your Sentry subscription.

Use Seer to:

- **[Review Code Changes](/product/ai-in-sentry/seer/ai-code-review/)**: Have Seer review your code changes in GitHub, catching bugs before merging pull requests.
- **[Fix Issues](/product/ai-in-sentry/seer/root-cause-analysis/)**: Run automated root cause analysis and generate suggested code fixes for errors and performance issues.

### Issue Summary

**Issue summary** provides a quick overview of an issue by highlighting key insights taken from event and issue-level metadata. You'll see a quick overview of what's going wrong, a potential cause, and if relevant, insights from trace-connected issues.

### Query Assistant

You can ask Seer to query your traces and spans data via natural language queries and find relevant samples of compute metrics without building the whole query manually 

### AI Summaries

See a summary of [User Feedback](/product/user-feedback/) and [Session Replays](/product/explore/session-replay/) to identify common issues and patterns.

## Privacy and security

Sentry includes strong guarantees for privacy and security of your data. At a glance:

- Sentry does not train generative AI models using your data by default and without your permission.
- AI-generated output is shown only to you and other authorized users in your account.

You can get more details at [AI Privacy and Security](/product/ai-in-sentry/ai-privacy-and-security/). To learn more about all our data privacy practices go to [the security and legal docs](/security-legal-pii/security/ai-ml-policy/#use-of-identifying-data-for-generative-ai-features).

## Disabling Generative AI Features

- If you want all generative AI features to be disabled for all users in your organization, you can do so in your organization's settings with the ["Show Generative AI Features" toggle](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/settings/#hideAiFeatures).

- To disable specific AI settings, go to [Seer settings](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/settings/seer/). For organizations that need to prevent code generation, or adding additional context in Alerts, you can find these configurations under [Advanced Settings](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/settings/seer/#enableSeerCoding) in Seer settings. 

**Note:** Disabling code generation prevents Seer from automatically generating code, or pushing code to your codebase. You can still ask Seer for code, copy and paste output, and use planning features.  This setting does not affect workflows involving your own coding agent.
