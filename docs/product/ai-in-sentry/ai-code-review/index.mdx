AI Code Review helps you reviews your code changes, predicting errors and offering suggestions for improvement before merging pull requests.

<Alert>
  AI Code Review is currently in <strong>beta</strong>. Beta features are
  still a work in progress and may have bugs. Please join the [Discord
  conversation](https://discord.com/channels/621778831602221064/1415468783648247870)
  to share your feedback.
</Alert>

## Getting Started

To enable AI Code Review in your GitHub organization or on specific repositories:

1.  Have the [Sentry GitHub integration](/organization/integrations/source-code-mgmt/github/) enabled.

2. Enable these required settings in your Sentry [organization settings](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/settings/:orgslug/):
   - `Show Generative AI Features`
   - `Enable AI Code Review`

### GitHub Permissions

AI Code Review requires specific GitHub permissions to function properly. When you install or update the Sentry GitHub integration, you'll need to accept the following permissions:

- **Pull Requests (Read & Write)**: To read PR content and write code review comments
- **Checks (Read & Write)**: To create status checks that show the AI Code Review results on your PRs

If you have previously installed the GitHub integration, you may need to update your permissions to include these. GitHub will prompt you to accept updated permissions when Sentry requests them.

<Alert level="info">
  Denying or ignoring permission update requests won't affect your current Sentry usage, but will prevent AI Code Review and other features from working.
</Alert>

## AI Code Review Commands

Ways AI Code Review can help you:

1. **Error Prediction** - When you create a pull request and set it to `Ready for Review`, AI Code Review will check for errors in your code. If no error is found, you will see a 🎉 emoji as a reaction to your PR description. Otherwise, AI Code Review will add comments to your PR. **Note:** We skip review if you set your PR to `draft` on creation.

2. **`@sentry review`** - Use this command in a PR comment, and the assistant will review the PR and predict errors, as well as make suggestions.

Once you have added a comment, the assistant will reply, acknowledging the request. For code reviews, you will then see comments added to your PR.

## GitHub Status Checks

AI Code Review creates GitHub status checks (also called "checks") on your pull requests to indicate whether the code review passed or found potential issues. These status checks appear in the PR's checks section and can be integrated with GitHub's branch protection rules.

### Status Check Behavior

- **Success**: If AI Code Review completes successfully, the status check will show as successful (green checkmark). This happens regardless of whether issues were found - the check indicates the review completed, not that the code is error-free.
- **Neutral**: If AI Code Review runs but has no specific pass/fail outcome, or if there's a service issue or timeout. We use neutral status for errors so users don't assume there's something wrong with their code when the issue is on our end.
- **Cancelled**: If the review was cancelled, typically because a new commit was pushed and the previous review was superseded.

### Visibility

Status checks from AI Code Review are visible to:
- All users with read access to the repository
- Anyone viewing the pull request on GitHub
- GitHub Actions and other CI/CD tools that check PR status

The detailed code review comments are also visible to all users with repository access, appearing as review comments on the pull request.

### Using with Branch Protection

You can optionally configure GitHub branch protection rules to require the AI Code Review status check before merging. To do this:

1. Go to your GitHub repository Settings > Branches
2. Add or edit a branch protection rule for your target branch (e.g., `main`)
3. Enable "Require status checks to pass before merging"
4. Search for and select the "Seer Code Review" status check
5. Save your changes

<Alert level="warning">
  We recommend making the AI Code Review status check an **optional** check. Requiring it will block PR merges if the check fails due to service disruptions, and may conflict with future personal configuration options that allow users to opt out of code review.

## Frequently Asked Questions

- **What data does AI Code Review need access to for the AI system to function, and what information is sent to third-party AI providers?**

  AI Code Review requires access to your pull requests, including PR metadata, repository information, file names, directory structures, and code diffs. Only file names, code diffs, and PR descriptions are sent to the AI provider for analysis.

- **Does AI Code run anywhere outside of GitHub, and does it run in the background?**

  AI Code Review only runs on GitHub. It will run once when a PR is marked `ready for review` (either when creating the PR, or after taking it out of draft), and otherwise only runs when triggered by a comment.

  You can learn more about AI privacy and security [here](/product/ai-in-sentry/ai-privacy-and-security/).

- **Why aren't `@sentry` commands working?**

  AI Code Review will respond with a message to enable the `Show Generative AI Features` and `Enable AI Code Review` settings in your [organization settings](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/settings/:orgslug/), if you have not already enabled them. Once enabled, try `@sentry review` again to run AI Code Review.

- **When does Error Prediction run?**

Error Prediction is automatically triggered by the following GitHub pull_request webhook events:
  - `opened`: when you open a new pull request (we skip those opened in `draft` state)
  - `ready_for_review`: when a draft pull request is marked as "Ready for review"

  To manually run error prediction and get a general review, comment `@sentry review` in the PR.

- **Why is the AI Code Review status check showing as neutral?**

  The status check shows as neutral if there's a temporary service issue or the review timed out. We use neutral status (rather than error) so users don't assume there's something wrong with their code when the issue is on our end. The status check does not fail based on code quality issues found during review - those appear as review comments on your PR.
  
  If you don't see a status check at all, ensure that the `Show Generative AI Features` and `Enable AI Code Review` settings are enabled in your [organization settings](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/settings/:orgslug/), and that your GitHub integration has the required Checks permission.

- **Can I disable status checks while keeping AI Code Review comments?**

  Status checks are automatically created whenever AI Code Review runs. If you don't want them to appear or affect your workflow, simply don't add them as a required check in your branch protection rules. The checks will still appear on PRs but won't block merging.
