Sentry's AI Code Review is a generative AI assistant developed by Sentry. It helps you generate new tests for uncovered code and reviews your code changes, offering suggestions for improvement before merging pull requests.

<Alert>
  Sentry's AI Code Review is currently in <strong>beta</strong>. Beta features are still a work in progress and may have bugs. Please join the [Discord conversation](https://discord.com/channels/621778831602221064/1385700674557444190) to share your feedback.

## Getting Started

To enable Sentry's AI Code Review in your GitHub organization or on specific repositories, you need to install the [Seer by Sentry app](https://github.com/apps/seer-by-sentry). This allows the assistant to analyze pull requests, provide insights, and write tests.

If you're not an admin, copy the Seer by Sentry GitHub App Integration link and share it with your organization's admin or owner to install it.

## AI Code Review Commands

After installing the app, use these commands in your pull request comments:

-  `@sentry review` - The assistant will review the PR and make suggestions.

- `@sentry generate-test` - The assistant will generate tests for your PR.

Once you have added a comment, the assistant will reply, acknowledging the request. For code reviews, you will then see comments added to your PR. For test generation, you will see a comment with a link to the generated tests.
