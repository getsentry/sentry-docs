</Alert>

## Getting Started

To enable the Sentry Prevent AI assistant in your GitHub organization or on specific repositories, you need to install the [Sentry Prevent AI GitHub App Integration](https://github.com/apps/seer-by-sentry). This allows the assistant to analyze pull requests and provide insights.

If you're not an admin, copy the Sentry Prevent AI GitHub App Integration link and share it with your organization's admin or owner to install it.

## Sentry Prevent AI Commands

After installing the app, use these commands in your pull request comments:

-  `@sentry review` - The assistant will review the PR and make suggestions.

- `@sentry generate-test` - The assistant will generate tests for your PR.

Once you have added a comment, the assistant will reply, acknowledging the request. For code reviews, you will then see comments added to your PR. For test generation, you will see a comment with a link to the generated tests.
