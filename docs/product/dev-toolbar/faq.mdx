<Expandable title="Are there plans to include the Dev Toolbar in the JavaScript SDK?">

The [Dev Toolbar](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-toolbar) and the [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript) are distinct features that we intentionally keep separated.

Some of the differences between the two include:
  - The toolbar is a UI product focused on making it easier to find and take action on existing data, while the SDK functions as infrastructure to collect and send data to the server.
  - The toolbar has a different set of [dependencies](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-toolbar/blob/main/package.json) and uses different browser APIs that the JavaScript SDK does not use. For example: the toolbar will interact with things like cookies and local storage. By keeping these pieces of code separate, it's easier to audit the [SDK code on GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript) to verify that it is not persisting information inside end-users' browsers.
  - The setup and deploy instruction are very different. The SDK is best deployed on staging and production environments, and can be configured easily with environment variables. The Dev Toolbar requires special considerations to deploy it into production, usually by creating a condition so that it's only included for members of your own Sentry organization.
