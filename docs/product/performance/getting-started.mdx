description: "Get started with Sentry's Performance Monitoring, which allows you to see macro-level metrics to micro-level spans, cross-reference transactions with related issues, and customize queries."
---

If you don't already have performance monitoring enabled, use the links for supported SDKs below to quickly set up access to our [Performance Monitoring](/product/performance/) features. Performance Monitoring helps you see everything from macro-level [metrics](/product/performance/metrics/) to micro-level [spans](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/trace-view/#product-walkthrough-trace-view-page), and you'll be able to cross-reference [transactions with related issues](/product/performance/transaction-summary/), customize [queries](/product/explore/discover-queries/query-builder/) based on your personal needs, and substantially more.
