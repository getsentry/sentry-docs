Performance widgets offer visualizations that you can change to best match your workflow. They provide performance-specific views that allow you to see and act on transaction data across your organization.
Depending on which [Performance Tab](/product/performance/filters-display/#tabs) you've selected, different curated performance widgets will be available.

<Note>

The value displayed in the top right of some widgets is the **overall value for the selected time period**, not the average of the data displayed in the chart. For datasets with low event volume, the overall value may be higher or lower than expected because metrics like [Apdex](/product/performance/metrics/#apdex) and [User Misery](/product/performance/metrics/#user-misery) are non-linear.

</Note>

## Average TTIDs
