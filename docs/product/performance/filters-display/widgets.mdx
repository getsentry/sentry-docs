Performance widgets offer visualizations that you can change to best match your workflow. They provide performance-specific views that allow you to see and act on transaction data across your organization.
Depending on which [Performance Tab](/product/performance/filters-display/#tabs) you've selected, different curated performance widgets will be available.

<Note>

The value displayed in the top right of some widgets is the **overall value for the selected time period**, not the average of the data displayed in the chart. For datasets with low event volume, the overall value may be higher or lower than expected because metrics like [Apdex](/product/performance/metrics/#apdex) and [User Misery](/product/performance/metrics/#user-misery) are non-linear.

</Note>

## Average TTIDs

Shows the average TTID duration for top screens for mobile projects. Click the screen name to view more information about the screen in the [Screen Loads](/product/performance/mobile-vitals/screen-loads/) page.

This widget is available in the [Mobile](/product/performance/filters-display/#mobile) tab.

## Most Changed

Shows those transactions from the selected transaction list that have changed (either improved or regressed) the most. Note that only trends of a specific significance and throughput are shown and that precedence is given to the most regressed transactions.

To filter by either **Most Improved** or **Most Regressed**, navigate to the trends page using the **View Trends** button. Learn more in [Trends](/product/performance/trends).

This widget is available in the [All Transactions](/product/performance/filters-display/#all-transactions), [Backend](/product/performance/filters-display/#backend) and [Mobile](/product/performance/filters-display/#mobile) tabs.
