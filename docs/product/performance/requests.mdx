If you have performance monitoring enabled, you can track your application's HTTP requests in Sentry. Sentry monitors all outgoing HTTP requests and helps you monitor and investigate the domains that serve those requests.

On the [**Requests** page](#requests-page), you get an overview of the domains that serve your application requests. From there, you can check each individual domain's behaviour on its [**Domain Summary** page](#domain-summary-page) and find sample events in the [Sample List](#sample-list).

## Eligibility

Availability of HTTP request monitoring depends on the SDK your application uses. In most cases, Sentry's SDKs automatically enable HTTP request tracking. You can check your SDK's <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation">automatic instrumentation documentation</PlatformLink> to see if it includes tracking HTTP requests.

Network requests using other protocols (FTP, WebSocket, etc.) are not supported at this time.

## Requests Page

The **Requests** page gives an overview of the domains that your application accesses via HTTP. You can use this page to see how those domains perform, including their average response duration and the rate of 3xx, 4xx, and 5xx HTTP response status codes.

You can access the **Requests** page by clicking "Requests" in the sidebar, under "Performance".

At the top of the page, there are three summary graphs that summary the overall behavior of your requests. The first is a requests per minute (throughput) chart. The second is an average duration chart. The third is a chart that show the percentage of 3xx, 4xx, and 5xx HTTP response status codes. You can click and drag to select a specific time range directly in a graph.

The domains table below the charts show a list of domains your application makes requests to. Each row also shows the throughput, average duration, HTTP response code rate, and total time your app spent making requests to the domain (time spent). The domain names are parameterized, where `*` means that the row includes all subdomains of that domain.

By default, the table is sorted by descending time spent. You can also sort by throughput, duration, and status response code rate. The domain search input les you search for specific domains.

To view more details, click on a domain name to open its **Domain Summary** page.

## Domain Summary Page

To open a domain's **Domain Summary** page, click on the domain from the table on the **Requests** page.

At the top of the page, you'll see the same throughput, duration, and response status code charts. You'll also see a link to the domain's status page, if one is known.

Below, you'll find a list of transactions that make requests to that domain, sorted by time spent.

If you want to investigate a specific transaction, click on it to open the request samples panel.

TODO: Arcade

## Sample List

Click on a transaction to open its sample list. This side panel shows metrics on this domain's behavior within the selected transaction. You can choose to view a breakdown either by duration, or by status code.

### Duration Breakdown

The duration breakdown shows the average duration of requests to the domain in the selected transaction. It also finds relevant samples to help you investigate the requests. Sentry tries to find samples that are faster than, slower than, and roughly equal to the average duration. The samples will also span the entire selected time range, if possible. Each sample is plotted on the duration chart and represented as a triangle.

The samples are also listed in a table below the chart. Each sample has a link to the relevant trace, the HTTP status of the response, and the full URL of the request.

### Response Code Breakdown

The response code breakdown chart plots the top 5 most common response status codes over time. You can use this chart to diagnose response code behavior. You can use the response code class selector in the top right to narrow down the status codes. For example, if you select the "3XX" value, the breakdown chart will narrow down to only HTTP status codes in the 300 range.

The table below the charts shows a list of sample spans of the selected response code range.
