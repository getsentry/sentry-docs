Clicking on a recurring job from the [**Cron Monitors**](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/crons/) page takes you to the **Cron Monitor Details** page. Here you'll be able to see:
- Daily historical bar chart: Displays the number of successful, failed, and missed check-ins for the selected job.
- Runtime line chart: Shows the average execution time for the job over time.

If you scroll down to the "ISSUE" section, you'll see any issues created when a job execution missed or failed. If you've configured the Sentry SDK for your job, any errors thrown during the job runtime will be shown here as well.

Just below, you'll find the table of "Recent Check-Ins" which lists previously scheduled jobs and their statuses.

## Check-in Status

Sentry's Cron Monitoring service can notify you and store a timeline of the following check-in events:

- **Missed check-in:** The job didn't execute in the predicted timeframe or frequency. This can happen for various reasons, such as:
  - The job scheduler is misconfigured, skipped, or failed to initiate your job.
  - A timeout failure event when a job sent an initial check-in but failed to send a final check-in.
  - Network issues, such as an outbound firewall or an unstable connection.
  - An invalid request format.
- **Failed check-in:** The job has reported its execution as unsuccessful.
- **Successful check-in:** The job has reported its execution as successful.
- **Unknown check-in:** In rare occasions, it is possible that Sentry is unable to identify a check-in status. This can happen during outages or maintenance periods.

To see information about your cron monitor, select "Crons" from the sidebar menu and click on your cron monitor's name.

## Monitor State

A monitor can have three states: active, muted, and disabled. Only disabled monitors do not count towards your plan's monitor limit.

- **Active:** The monitor is currently accepting and processing check-ins. New Cron Monitor issues will be created for failed or missed check-ins according to your monitor configuration.
- **Muted:** The monitor and it's environments are accepting check-ins but will not create any Cron Monitor issues for failed or missed check-ins. This is useful when you want to temporarily disable alerting for a monitor.
- **Disabled:** The monitor and it's environments are not accepting check-ins, with any check-ins sent to a disabled monitor will be dropped. Disabled monitors do not count towards your plan's monitor limit.

<Alert level="info" title="Note">
  The monitor state supercedes the [environment state](#environment-state). If a
  monitor is disabled or muted, so will all environments of it's environments,
  regardless of their individual state.
</Alert>

### Muting Monitors

You can mute job monitoring in the header of your cron monitor:

### Disabling Monitors

You can disable job monitoring in the header of your cron monitor:

### Deleting Monitors

You can delete a monitor from the monitor details page.

<Alert level="danger" title="Caution">
  Deleting a monitor will remove all of its environments and check-in history.
  This action is irreversible.
</Alert>

## Multiple Environments

A monitor can be configured with multiple environments, with all environments running with the same schedule. Only environments with at least one check-in will be displayed and made available for alerting and filtering.

Although the schedule of check-ins of all environments are the same, the environment state and check-ins are independent of each other. This means that a missed or failed check-in in one environment will not affect the state of other environments.

If you're using one of Crons' [supported SDKs](/product/crons/getting-started/), the check-in environment will be automatically set to the environment configured in the SDK. If you're using the API, you can set the environment in the check-in payload.

## Environment State

Indepent of the monitor state, each environment can have one of the following states:

- **Healthy:** The environment's latest check-in was successful.
- **Unhealthy:** The environment's latest check-in was a failure or a miss.
- **Waiting for check-in:** The environment has not had any check-ins.
- **Muted:** The environment is muted and will not create any Cron Monitor issues.
- **Broken:** The environment has multiple failed or missed check-ins in a row.

### Broken Environments

Monitor environments that have been consistenly unhealthy for 14 days will be marked as broken. If no action is taken, Sentry will automatically mute the environment after 30 days of being broken. To recover a broken environment, a new healthy check-in must be sent.

### Muting Environments

To mute an environment, you can do so from the monitor list or the monitor details page.

1. Hover the environment state.
2. Select "Mute Environment".

### Deleting Environments

1. Hover the environment state.
2. Select "Delete Environment".
