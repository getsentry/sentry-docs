### Why Were All My Monitors Disabled?

All monitors are automatically deactivated at the start of a new billing period if there's not enough [on-demand spend](/product/accounts/pricing/#on-demand-capacity) to cover all active monitors. Monitors can be manually activated based on on-demand availability. See [Manage Your Cron Monitors](/product/accounts/quotas/manage-cron-monitors) for more details.

### Why Was My Monitor Environment Marked As Broken or Automatically Muted?

If your monitor environment has been in a failing state for 14 days or more, we will automatically mark it as broken and notify you of this escalated failure state via email. If the monitor environment stays in this state for another 14 days, we will automatically mute it to stop it from generating additional noise through notifications or issue events.

### Why Aren't Recurring Job Errors Showing Up on My Monitor Details Page?

You may not have [linked errors to your monitor](/product/crons/getting-started/http/#connecting-errors-to-cron-monitors).

### Why Am I Not Receiving Alerts When My Monitor Fails?

You may not have [set up alerts for your monitor](/product/crons/getting-started/http/#alerts).

### What Is the Crons Data Retention Policy for Check-ins?

Our current data retention policy is 90 days.

### Do You Support a Monitor Schedule With a Six-field Crontab Expression?

Currently, we only support crontab expressions with five fields.
