<Alert>
  The Sentry Toolbar is currently in **beta**. Beta features are still in progress and may have bugs. Please reach out on
  [GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-toolbar/issues) if you have any feedback or concerns.
</Alert>

## Pre-Requisites

For the Sentry Toolbar to work best, [enable tracing](/platforms/javascript/tracing/) in your app. With tracing enabled, the Sentry Toolbar will be able to associate issues and feedback with the current URL in the browser location.

## 1. Allow Domains

Since the Sentry Toolbar will be visible to users within your app, it's important to consider which environments should render it. See the [FAQ: _"In what environments should I enable the Sentry Toolbar?"_](/product/sentry-toolbar/faq/#in-what-environments-should-i-enable-the-dev-toolbar) for tips.

You will need to edit the [Project Settings](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/settings/projects/) page to allow the Toolbar to connect to Sentry. Add any production, staging, or development domains to the list. Only add domains that you trust and control to this list.

## 2. Install

If you are developing a React based application, it's time to add the Toolbar into your `package.json` file.

Or, you can skip ahead to the next step to find the CDN configuration instructions.

```bash {tabTitle: npm}
npm install --save @sentry/toolbar
```
```bash {tabTitle: yarn}
yarn add @sentry/toolbar
```

## 3. Configure

Finally, whether you have a React application or are loading the Toolbar from the CDN, you need to initialize the Toolbar using JavaScript. This will prompt any visitor to login to your Sentry organization.

```javascript {tabTitle: React}
import {useSentryToolbar} from '@sentry/toolbar';

useSentryToolbar({
  // Remember to conditionally enable the Toolbar.
  // This will reduce network traffic for users
  // who do not have credentials to login to Sentry.
  enabled,

  initProps: {
    organizationSlug: 'acme',
    projectIdOrSlug: 'website',
  },
})
```
```html {tabTitle: CDN}
<html>
<head>...</head>
<body>
    ...
    <!--
    Put this at the bottom of your page so it doesnâ€™t
    block other critical JavaScript.

    Remember to conditionally include the Toolbar
    script. This will reduce network traffic for users
    who do not have credentials to login to Sentry.
    -->
    <script src="https://browser.sentry-cdn.com/sentry-toolbar/latest/toolbar.min.js"></script>
    <script>
    window.SentryToolbar.init({
      organizationSlug: 'acme',
      projectIdOrSlug: 'website',
    });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

See the [FAQ: _"How can I conditionally initialize the Toolbar?"_](/product/sentry-toolbar/faq/#how-can-i-conditionally-initialize-the-toolbar) for help implementing conditions for different environments.

### Init Configuration Options

At minimum, you must set `organizationSlug` and `projectIdOrSlug`.

The complete list of options is here:

| Option | Type | Description | Default Value |
| ------ | ---- | ----------- | ------------- |
| `organizationSlug` | `string` | The organization that users should login to. For example \'acme\' | *Required Value* |
| `projectIdOrSlug` | `string \| number` | The project for which this website/webapp is associated. | *Required Value* |
| `environment (optional)` | `string \| string[] \| undefined` | The environment of this deployment. Used to narrow search results in the Toolbar UI. Set to `undefined` or `""` or `[]` if you want to see results from all environments. | `undefined` |
| `placement (optional)` | `'right-edge' \| 'bottom-right-corner'` | Where to render the Toolbar on the screen. | `'right-edge'` |
| `theme (optional)` | `'system' \| 'dark' \| 'light'` | Whether to use dark or light mode. | `'system'` |
| `featureFlags (optional)` | `FeatureFlagAdapter \| undefined` | See [Feature Flag Panel](/product/sentry-toolbar/setup//#feature-flag-Panel) below | `undefined` |
| `sentryOrigin (optional)` | `string \| undefined` | The origin where Sentry can be found. Used for loading the connection to Sentry, and generating links to the website. For example: `'https://acme.sentry.io'` | `'https://sentry.io'` |
| `domId (optional)` | `string \| undefined` | The `id` given to the \<div\> that is created to contain the Toolbar html. | `'sentry-toolbar'` |
| `debug (optional)` | `string \| undefined` | A comma separated string of debug targets to enable. Example: `'logging,state'`. If the list contains 'all' or 'true' then all targets will be enabled. Valid targets: `'logging' 'login-success' 'settings' 'state'` | `undefined` |
| `mountPoint (optional)` | `HTMLElement \| () => HTMLElement \| undefined` | Where to mount the Toolbar in the DOM. | `document.body` |
| `transactionToSearchTerm (optional)` | `(transactionName: string) => string` | Hook to transform transactionName into a search term | See [transactionToSearchTerm.ts](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-toolbar/blob/main/src/lib/utils/transactionToSearchTerm.ts) |

### Extra React Hook Options

The React hook supports some other top-level options. The defaults values are:

```javascript {tabTitle:React}
useSentryToolbar({
  initProps: {
    organizationSlug: 'acme',
    projectIdOrSlug: 'website',
  },

  // Optional:
  enabled: true,

  // Optional: Either `version` or `cdn`
  // If both are set then `cdn` will override `version`
  version: 'latest',
  cdn: 'https://browser.sentry-cdn.com/sentry-toolbar/latest/toolbar.min.js',
})
```

| Options | Type | Description | Default Value |
| ------- | ---- | ----------- | ------------- |
| `enabled` | `boolean (optional)` | Conditionally initialize the toolbar. Set this to false to avoid requesting the toolbar code on the browser, or to safely unmount an existing toolbar instance | `true` |
| `version` | `string (optional)` | Request a speicifc version of the toolbar from the CDN. It's recommended to use `latest` for automatic updates. See https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-toolbar/releases for a list of available release tags. | `'latest'` |
| `cdn` | `string (optional)` | Overrides the `version` field above. Setting the CDN is useful if you want to self-host a specific version of the Toolbar. | `'https://browser.sentry-cdn.com/sentry-toolbar/latest/toolbar.min.js'` |


### Unmounting the Toolbar

If you have called `SentryToolbar.init({...})` to render the Toolbar, but now want to manually remove or unmount it from the page, you can call the cleanup function that is returned from `init()`. This will unmount all the injected HTML and CSS. Login credentials will not be removed, so you can re-insert the toolbar and still be authenticated.

If you are using the React hook, then the toolbar will unmount when the React component is unmounted. Or if you set `enabled: false`.

```javascript
const unmountToolbar = window.SentryToolbar.init({ ... });

// sometime later...
unmountToolbar();
```
```javascript {tabTitle:React}
useSentryToolbar({
  enabled: false, // The toolbar will not be mounted
  initProps: {
    ...
  },
})
```

## Feature Flag Panel

<Alert>
  If you're using feature flags inside your product then also setup [Feature Flag Evaluation and Change Tracking](/platforms/javascript/feature-flags/) within your SDK.
</Alert>

In order to integrate your feature flagging platform with the Sentry Toolbar, you will need an adapter that can read flag data from your provider. It will also store and retrieve a list of overrides to apply to your local browser session.

There is a built-in `OpenFeatureAdapter` that is compatible with the [open-feature/js-sdk-contrib](https://github.com/open-feature/js-sdk-contrib). To use it, call the `SentryToolbar.OpenFeatureAdapter` implementation.

```html {tabTitle: CDN}
<script>
// Define your provider
const provider = new FlagdWebProvider({...});

// Set the provider into the OpenFeature SDK
OpenFeature.setProvider(provider);

window.SentryToolbar.init({
  ...
  // Set the provider into the OpenFeatureAdapter
  featureFlags: window.SentryToolbar.OpenFeatureAdapter({provider})
});
</script>
```
```typescript {tabTitle: React}
import {OpenFeature} from '@openfeature/web-sdk';
import {FlagdWebProvider} from '@openfeature/flagd-web-provider';

// Define your provider
const provider = new FlagdWebProvider({...});

// Set the provider into the OpenFeature SDK
OpenFeature.setProvider(provider);

window.SentryToolbar.init({
  ...
  // Set the provider into the OpenFeatureAdapter
  featureFlags: window.SentryToolbar.OpenFeatureAdapter({provider})
});
```

You can also create your own adapter by implementing the [`FeatureFlagAdapter` interface](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-toolbar/blob/main/src/lib/types/featureFlags.ts).

The adapter interface is:
```typescript
type FlagValue = boolean | string | number | undefined;
type FlagMap = Record<string, FlagValue>;
interface FeatureFlagAdapter {
  /**
   * All known flag names and their evaluated values.
   */
  getFlagMap: () => Promise<FlagMap>;

  /**
   * Any overridden or manually set flags and values.
   */
  getOverrides: () => Promise<FlagMap>;

  /**
   * Manually set a flag to be a specific value, overriding the evaluated value.
   */
  setOverride: (name: string, override: FlagValue) => void;

  /**
   * A callback to clear all overrides from this browser.
   */
  clearOverrides: () => void;

  /**
   * Deeplink into your external feature-flag provider and find out more about
   * this specific flag.
   */
    urlTemplate?: undefined | ((name: string) => string | URL | undefined);
}
```

[MockFeatureFlagAdapter.tsx](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-toolbar/blob/main/src/env/demo/MockFeatureFlagAdapter.tsx) is an example adapter to use as a reference.
