<Alert>
 New Monitors and Alerts is currently in <strong>beta</strong>. Beta features are still a work in progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony. Help improve this feature by providing feedback on our [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/discussions/101960).
</Alert>

Sentry's Alerts help you take action on issues in your projects. When an issue changes state, is created, or passes a threshold, an alert is triggered to perform external actions like sending notifications, creating tickets, or calling webhooks and integrations. Choose to alert based on the conditions of specific [Monitors](/product/new-monitors-and-alerts/monitors/), or all issues in a project.

### Some examples of when you could use an Alert
- Send a notification to your team's Slack channel when a new error occurs in an existing issue
- Create a ticket in JIRA when an issue is created and a team member is assigned
- Call a webhook or integration when an issue is created

## Creating an Alert

To create an Alert, navigate to the [Alerts](https://sentry.io/issues/alerts/new/) page and click **Create Alert**.

### Select Sources and Environments

The source of an Alert can come from either one or more projects, or one or more Monitors. Once you've selected your sources, you can set the environment(s) for the Alerts to run on. By default, Alerts will run on all environments.

### Set Triggers

A trigger is an action that must occur for the Alert to run. All trigger actions are issue state based. For example, you may want to send a notification to your team's Slack channel _when an issue is created_. You can select multiple triggers in a single Alert. They will run under an `ANY` condition, meaning that if any one of the triggers happen, the Alert will run. 

### Set Filters 

Filters are conditions that must be met for the Alert to run. For example, you may want to create a ticket _only for issues that are assigned to a specific team_ and _at a certain severity_. You can create multiple filters in a single Alert, and group them under either `ANY` or `ALL` conditions. For `ANY` conditions, if any one of the filters are true, the Alert will run. For `ALL` conditions, only if all of the filters are true, the Alert will run.

### Add Actions

Actions are the events that will be executed when the Alert is run. You can send notifications on any channel you're integrated with, create tickets, for example, in JIRA, or call a webhook or integration. You can set multiple actions in a single Alert. Learn more about Sentry's [integrations](/organization/integrations/).

**Note:** Some Monitors can only alert on certain integrations. See Sentry's [integrations](/organization/integrations/) for more information.

## Managing Alerts

You can see a list of all your Alerts on the [Alerts](https://sentry.io/issues/alerts/) page. By default, Alerts are filtered down to your projects. 

<Alert>

Alerts are an Organization-level feature. By default, all team members can create and edit Alerts. You can update this setting in [Organization Membership settings](https://sentry.io/settings/organization/).

</Alert>

By clicking on an Alert, you can view the details, edit the Alert, or turn it on or off.

The details page will show a high level chart of how often the Alert has run, a list of the most recent runs, the configuration, and connected monitors. 

## Notifications

Besides Alerts, Sentry sends you notifications about various things like [issue state changes](/product/issues/states-triage/), [release deploys](/product/releases/), and [quota usage](/pricing/quotas/). You can fine-tune these notifications, as well as your personal alert settings, in **User Settings > Notifications**. Learn more about notifications and adjusting their associated settings in [the full documentation](/product/new-monitors-and-alerts/alerts/notifications/).
