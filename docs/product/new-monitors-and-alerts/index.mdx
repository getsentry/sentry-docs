<Alert>
 New Monitors and Alerts is currently in <strong>beta</strong>. Beta features are still a work in progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony. Help improve this feature by providing feedback on our [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/discussions/101960).
</Alert>

Sentry's Monitors and Alerts help you proactively track and respond to issues in your application. Use [**Monitors**](/product/new-monitors-and-alerts/monitors/) to track cron jobs, scheduled tasks, and uptime for your services. Set up [**Alerts**](/product/new-monitors-and-alerts/alerts/) to get notified when errors occur, performance degrades, or monitors fail, so you can quickly identify and resolve problems before they impact your users.
