Sentry's OAuth integration allows third-party platforms to connect with existing Sentry customers. This enables users to link their Sentry organizations with your product, providing seamless access to error monitoring and performance data.

For complete OAuth2 implementation details including endpoints, token management, PKCE, and code examples, see the [Authentication documentation](/api/auth/#oauth2).

## What OAuth Enables

- **Account linking** between your platform and specific Sentry organizations
- **Permission-based access** with configurable [API scopes](/api/permissions/)
- **User-controlled permissions** with easy revocation
- **Seamless authentication** without requiring users to share credentials

## User Experience

1. **Account Linking**: Users sign into your platform and see a "Connect to Sentry" button with context about what permissions your product will have.

2. **Sentry Authentication**: Clicking the button opens a Sentry login modal where users authenticate with their Sentry account.

3. **Permission Confirmation**: After login, users see details about required permissions, the specific Sentry organization being connected, and what actions your platform can perform.

4. **Connection Complete**: Once confirmed, your platform receives an authorization code that can be exchanged for API tokens.

## Partner Registration

Before implementing OAuth, Sentry must register your application. Contact our partnership team with:

- **Client Name**: Your platform name
- **Redirect URIs**: Your OAuth callback URLs
- **Allowed Origins**: Your domain(s)
- **Home Page URL**: Your platform's homepage
- **Privacy Policy URL**: Your privacy policy
- **Terms and Conditions URL**: Your terms of service
- **Required Scopes**: APIs your platform needs to access (see [Permissions & Scopes](/api/permissions/))

## Revoking Access

Users can revoke your application's access at any time through their Sentry account settings (**Settings → Account → Authorized Applications**). Your application should handle 401 responses gracefully and prompt users to reconnect when needed.
