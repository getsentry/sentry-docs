# Account Provisioning API

The Sentry Provisioning API allows partner platforms to automatically create Sentry organizations for their customers. This enables seamless onboarding of your users to Sentry's error monitoring and performance insights.

## Overview

When you call the Sentry provisioning API on behalf of your customer for the first time, the customer receives:

- **A Sentry Organization** with the same name as their organization on your platform
- **A Default Team** for collaboration within the organization
- **Organization Ownership** assigned to the provided email address
- **Subscription Plan** based on your partnership agreement
- **Pre-configured Projects** (optional) that you specify
- **Integration Token** (optional) for managing the organization programmatically

## API Endpoint

```
POST https://sentry.io/remote/channel-provision/account/
```

## Authentication

The API requires a custom `X-Request-Signature` header with a SHA256 HMAC signature. The signature is built using your `API_SECRET_KEY` and the request body.

### Signature Generation

```python
import hmac
import hashlib
import json

def generate_signature(data, secret_key):
    secret_key_bytes = secret_key.encode("utf-8")
    json_data = json.dumps(data)
    data_bytes = json_data.encode("utf-8")
    signature = hmac.new(
        key=secret_key_bytes, 
        msg=data_bytes, 
        digestmod=hashlib.sha256
    ).hexdigest()
    return signature
```

## Request Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `channel` | string | Yes | Your partner name (case insensitive) |
| `email` | string | Yes | Customer's email address (becomes org owner) |
| `organizationName` | string | Yes | Customer's organization name (max 50 chars) |
| `organizationID` | string | Yes | Unique ID for customer's organization on your platform |
| `hasAgreedTerms` | boolean | Yes | Customer's agreement to Sentry terms |
| `timestamp` | integer | Yes | Current timestamp for request expiration |
| `url` | string | Yes | Must be `https://sentry.io/remote/channel-provision/account/` |
| `projects` | array | No | List of projects to create |
| `region` | string | No | Data residency (`us` or `de`, default: `us`) |
| `isTest` | boolean | No | Set to `true` for testing (default: `false`) |

### Project Object Structure

```json
{
  "name": "project-name",
  "platform": "java"
}
```

### Supported Platforms

The `platform` field supports all Sentry platform identifiers, including:
- `javascript`, `python`, `java`, `csharp`, `php`, `ruby`, `go`, `rust`, `swift`, `kotlin`, `dart`, and more

## Example Request

```python
import requests
import json
import time

URL = "https://sentry.io/remote/channel-provision/account/"
API_SECRET_KEY = "your-partner-specific-secret-key"

DATA = {
    "channel": "Your Platform Name",
    "organizationName": "Customer Corp",
    "organizationID": "unique-customer-id",
    "email": "customer@example.com",
    "projects": [
        {"name": "web-app", "platform": "javascript"},
        {"name": "api-service", "platform": "python"}
    ],
    "hasAgreedTerms": True,
    "timestamp": int(time.time()),
    "url": URL,
    "isTest": False
}

# Generate signature
signature = generate_signature(DATA, API_SECRET_KEY)

# Make request
response = requests.post(
    URL, 
    data=json.dumps(DATA), 
    headers={"X-Request-Signature": signature}
)

print(response.json())
```

## Response

### Success (200)

```json
{
  "email": "customer@example.com",
  "organization": {
    "id": "123",
    "slug": "customer-corp",
    "name": "Customer Corp"
  },
  "projects": [
    {
      "dsn": "https://...@sentry.io/123",
      "project": {
        "id": "456",
        "slug": "web-app",
        "name": "web-app",
        "platform": "javascript"
      }
    }
  ],
  "integration_api_token": "your-integration-token"
}
```

### Error Responses

- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid parameters (check response body for details)
- **401 Unauthorized**: Invalid signature (check your API_SECRET_KEY)
- **500 Server Error**: Internal server error (check response body for details)

## Additional Operations

### Adding Projects

Call the API again with new projects to add them to an existing organization:

```python
DATA = {
    # ... existing parameters ...
    "projects": [
        {"name": "new-service", "platform": "go"}
    ]
}
```

### Adding Managers

Add additional users as managers to the organization:

```python
DATA = {
    # ... existing parameters ...
    "email": "manager@example.com"  # New manager email
}
```

## Customer Experience

### Welcome Email

When you provision an organization, the customer receives:
- A welcome email with organization details
- Instructions for managing their Sentry organization
- Information about your partnership integration
- Support contact information

### Partner-Specific Features

Based on your partnership agreement, you can enable:

- **Partner Presence**: Show your platform as an organization member
- **Persistent Plan**: Allow customers to upgrade plans independently
- **Quota Visibility**: Control visibility of usage quotas

## Integration Token

The response includes an `integration_api_token` that allows you to:
- Create and manage projects
- Manage organization members
- Access Sentry APIs on behalf of the customer

Token permissions are defined in your partnership agreement.

## Best Practices

1. **Store organization mappings**: Keep track of the relationship between your customer IDs and Sentry organization IDs
2. **Handle errors gracefully**: Implement proper error handling for failed provisioning
3. **Use test mode**: Set `isTest: true` during development and testing
4. **Respect rate limits**: Implement appropriate delays between requests
5. **Secure your secret key**: Store your API_SECRET_KEY securely and never expose it in client-side code
