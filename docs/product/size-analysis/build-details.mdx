description: Understand your app's size breakdown with treemaps, insights, and detailed component analysis.

The Build Details page provides a comprehensive view of your app's size, breaking down which components, frameworks, and resources contribute to your app's overall footprint.

## Viewing Build Details

Navigate to a specific build in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) to see its detailed size analysis. You can access build details from:

- The Size Analysis project page
- Links in GitHub PR comments (when the [GitHub integration](/product/size-analysis/github-integration/) is enabled)
- Build comparison views

## Treemap

The treemap provides an interactive, visual representation of your app's size breakdown. Each rectangle represents a component of your app, with the size of the rectangle proportional to that component's contribution to the overall app size.

### How to Use the Treemap

- **Larger rectangles** indicate components that take up more space
- **Click on a rectangle** to drill down into that component's sub-components
- **Hover over a rectangle** to see detailed size information
- **Use the breadcrumb navigation** at the top to navigate back up the hierarchy

The treemap helps you quickly identify the largest contributors to your app size and find optimization opportunities.

## Insights

Insights automatically highlight important patterns and potential issues in your build:

- **Unusually large components**: Identifies frameworks or resources that are significantly larger than typical
- **Duplicate resources**: Finds resources that may be included multiple times
- **Optimization opportunities**: Suggests areas where you might reduce size

These insights help you prioritize your size optimization work by focusing on the areas with the most potential impact.

## Breakdown

The breakdown view provides a detailed, tabular breakdown of your app's components. This view shows:

- **Component name**: The name of the framework, library, or resource
- **Size**: The component's size (in bytes, KB, or MB)
- **Percentage**: What percentage of the total app size this component represents
- **Change**: How this component's size has changed from previous builds (when available)

### Sorting and Filtering

- **Sort by size** to find the largest components
- **Sort by change** to see which components grew or shrank the most
- **Filter by type** to focus on specific categories (frameworks, resources, code, etc.)

## Size Metrics

Each build displays several key size metrics:

- **Total app size**: The complete size of the app bundle or archive
- **Download size**: The estimated size when downloaded from the app store (compressed)
- **Install size**: The estimated size after installation on a device

Understanding these different metrics helps you optimize for the right target. Download size affects user acquisition, while install size affects device storage.

## Next Steps

- [Compare builds](/product/size-analysis/build-comparison/) to see how your changes impact app size
- [Set up GitHub integration](/product/size-analysis/github-integration/) to receive size insights on pull requests
