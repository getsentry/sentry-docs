description: Set up the GitHub integration to receive size change notifications as PR comments and status checks.
---

The GitHub integration brings Size Analysis directly into your pull request workflow by posting size change summaries as PR comments and status checks.

<Alert level="info">
  GitHub is currently the only supported VCS provider for Size Analysis.
</Alert>

## Benefits

With the GitHub integration enabled, you get:

- **PR comments**: Automatic comments on pull requests showing size changes
- **Status checks**: Pass/fail checks based on size thresholds (coming soon)
- **Inline notifications**: See size impacts without leaving GitHub
- **Historical tracking**: Links to detailed comparisons in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io)

## Installation

### Install the Sentry GitHub App

The GitHub integration requires the Sentry GitHub App to be installed on your repository:

1. Navigate to **Organization Settings > Integrations** in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io)
2. Find the **GitHub** integration and click **Install**
3. Follow the prompts to authorize the app for your GitHub organization
4. Select the repositories where you want to enable Size Analysis

For detailed installation instructions, see the [GitHub integration documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/organization/integrations/source-code-mgmt/github/).

### Configure Repository Access

Ensure the Sentry GitHub App has access to the repositories where you're uploading builds:

1. Go to your GitHub organization settings
2. Navigate to **Integrations > Applications**
3. Click on **Sentry**
4. Under **Repository access**, grant access to your repositories

## How It Works

Once the integration is set up and you're uploading builds from your CI:

### On Pull Requests

1. **You open a PR**: Your CI builds the app and uploads it to Sentry
2. **Base branch build**: Sentry finds the corresponding build from your base branch
3. **Comparison**: Sentry compares the two builds
4. **PR comment**: A comment is posted with the size change summary

### Comment Content

The PR comment includes:

- **Total size change**: How much the app grew or shrank (e.g., "+142 KB" or "-23 KB")
- **Percentage change**: The relative impact (e.g., "+2.3%")
- **Component highlights**: The components that changed the most
- **Link to details**: A link to view the full comparison in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io)

### Example PR Comment

```
## ðŸ“Š Size Analysis

**App size changed by +142 KB (+2.3%)**

### Largest Changes
- `Frameworks/MyFramework.framework`: +98 KB
- `Resources/Assets.car`: +52 KB
- `Binary`: -8 KB

## Requirements

For the GitHub integration to work with Size Analysis:

1. **GitHub App installed**: The Sentry GitHub App must be installed on your repository
2. **Builds from PRs**: You must upload builds from pull request CI runs
3. **Base branch builds**: You must also upload builds from your main/base branch
4. **Metadata**: Your build uploads must include PR metadata (auto-detected in GitHub Actions)

## Troubleshooting

### Not Seeing PR Comments?

Check that:

- The Sentry GitHub App is installed and has access to your repository
- You're uploading builds from both PR branches and the base branch
- Your CI is running on pull request events
- The `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` is set correctly in your CI environment
- Your builds have the same build configuration (e.g., both are `Release` builds)

### Comments Not Updating?

- Make sure you're uploading a new build after each code change
- Check that the build configuration matches between PR and base builds
- Verify that the PR metadata (PR number, base SHA) is being detected correctly

### Missing Base Build?

The first time you set up Size Analysis, your main branch may not have any builds yet:

1. Merge a PR or push to your main branch to trigger a build
2. Future PRs will be able to compare against this base build

## Permissions

The GitHub App requires these permissions:

- **Read access to code**: To identify the repository and branches
- **Write access to pull requests**: To post comments on PRs
- **Write access to checks**: To create status checks (coming soon)

These permissions are requested during the GitHub App installation flow.

## Next Steps

- [Upload your first build](/product/size-analysis/getting-started/) to start seeing size analysis
- [View build comparisons](/product/size-analysis/build-comparison/) to understand size changes in detail
