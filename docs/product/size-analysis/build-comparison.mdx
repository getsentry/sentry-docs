Build comparison helps you understand how changes between two builds impact your app size. When you open a pull request, Size Analysis automatically compares your PR build against the base branch, showing you exactly what changed.

## Automatic PR Comparisons

When the [GitHub integration](/product/size-analysis/github-integration/) is enabled and you upload builds from pull requests, Size Analysis automatically:

1. Compares the PR build to the base branch build
2. Posts a comment on the PR with size change summary
3. Updates the PR status check with the size impact

This makes size considerations a natural part of your code review process.

## Viewing Comparisons

You can view detailed build comparisons in two ways:

### In GitHub

When a PR has builds from both the head and base branches, Size Analysis posts a comment showing:

- **Total size change**: How much the app grew or shrank
- **Percentage change**: The relative size impact
- **Component changes**: Which components changed the most

Click the link in the PR comment to view the full comparison in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

### In Sentry

Navigate to Size Analysis in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and select a build to compare. You can:

- Compare any two builds from the same project
- Filter comparisons by branch, commit, or build configuration
- View detailed component-level changes

## What's Compared

Build comparisons show changes across several dimensions:

### Size Changes

- **Total size delta**: The overall size increase or decrease
- **Component-level changes**: Which specific components grew or shrank
- **New components**: Components added in the new build
- **Removed components**: Components removed from the previous build

### Component Details

For each changed component, the comparison shows:

- **Absolute change**: How many bytes the component grew or shrank
- **Percentage change**: The relative size change
- **Before/after sizes**: The component's size in both builds

### Visualization

The comparison view includes:

- **Treemap comparison**: Side-by-side treemaps showing both builds
- **Delta view**: A visual representation highlighting size changes
- **Table view**: A sortable table of all component changes

## Understanding Changes

### Expected Size Increases

Some changes naturally increase app size:

- Adding new features or dependencies
- Including additional assets or resources
- Supporting new platforms or device types

### Unexpected Size Increases

Watch out for:

- **Large dependency updates**: A minor version bump shouldn't cause major size changes
- **Duplicate resources**: The same resource included multiple times
- **Debug symbols**: Debug information accidentally included in release builds
- **Unoptimized assets**: Images or other resources that could be compressed

## Build Configuration Matching

Builds are only compared if they have the same build configuration. For example:

- iOS `Debug` builds are only compared with other `Debug` builds
- Android `freeRelease` builds are only compared with other `freeRelease` builds

This ensures you're comparing apples to apples and prevents misleading comparisons between fundamentally different build types.

## Using Comparisons in Your Workflow

### Set Size Budgets

Use historical comparisons to establish size budgets for your app:

1. Review typical size changes from past PRs
2. Define acceptable size increase thresholds
3. Flag PRs that exceed these thresholds during code review

### Identify Size Regressions

When you see an unexpected size increase:

1. Review the comparison to identify which components changed
2. Check if the size increase is justified by the functionality added
3. Look for optimization opportunities (compress assets, remove unused code, etc.)
4. Consider breaking large PRs into smaller ones to isolate size impacts

### Track Size Over Time

Compare builds across releases to:

- Understand long-term size trends
- Identify gradual size creep
- Measure the impact of size optimization initiatives
