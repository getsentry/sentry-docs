## Github

The GitHub integration brings Size Analysis directly into your pull request workflow by adding status checks. This alerts developers to the size impact their code changes have on the app build, and can optionally block the pull request from being merged on large size increases.

### Installation

1. Install the Sentry Github App by following the installation instructions in the [GitHub integration documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/organization/integrations/source-code-mgmt/github/).

2. Set up Size Analysis by following the guide for [iOS](/platforms/apple/guides/ios/size-analysis/) or [Android](/platforms/android/size-analysis/).

3. Create a workflow to upload base branch builds.

Size Analysis works by comparing a head vs a base build, similar to how code review compares your new code to the baseline code. First, we need to upload base builds:

```yml {filename:sentry_size_analysis_main.yml}
name: Sentry Size Analysis Upload

on:
  push:
    branches: [main] // or whatever is used

jobs:
  build_and_upload:
    // ...
```

Confirm that builds uploaded from this workflow have the correct `sha` metadata value, as well as no `base_sha` being set.

4. Create a workflow to upload pull request builds.

Next, we need the head build uploads:

```yml {filename:sentry_size_analysis_pull_request.yml}
name: Sentry Size Analysis Upload

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main] // or whatever is used

jobs:
  build_and_upload:
    // ...
```

Confirm that builds uploaded from this workflow have the correct `sha` and `base_sha` metadata values.

5. Confirm the status check appears

After configuring both workflows and sending the correct metadata, the status check should appear on every commit:

![Example Status Check =600x](./images/status-check-inline.png)

6. View the detailed breakdown

Clicking on the "Details" button above should bring you to a more detailed breakdown of the changes.

## Troubleshooting

### Not Seeing status checks ?

Check that:

- The Sentry GitHub App is installed and has access to your repository
- You're correctly uploading builds for size analysis from all base branch builds
- You're correctly uploading builds for size analysis from the PR branch.
- Your builds that you want to compare have the same build configuration (for example, both are `Release` builds)
- You're builds contain all the required metadata. TODO link to required metadat

### Missing Base Build?

The first time you set up Size Analysis, your main branch may not have any builds yet:

1. Merge a PR or push to your main branch to trigger a build
2. Future PRs will be able to compare against this base build

## Next Steps

- [Upload your first build](/product/size-analysis/uploading-builds/) to start seeing size analysis
