<Include name="size-analysis/github-only" />

The GitHub integration brings Size Analysis directly into your pull request workflow by adding status checks for size analysis.

TODO: something like a ##benefits?

## Installation

### Install the Sentry GitHub App

Install the Sentry Github App by following the installation instructions in the [GitHub integration documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/organization/integrations/source-code-mgmt/github/).

### Upload builds

1. Set up size analysis by following the guide for [iOS](/platforms/apple/guides/ios/size-analysis/) or [Android](/platforms/android/size-analysis/).

2. Ensure all base branch builds are uploading builds.

3. Ensure all PR builds are uploading builds.

## How It Works

Once the integration is set up and you're uploading builds from your CI:

### On Pull Requests

1. **You open a PR**: Your CI builds the app and uploads it to Sentry
2. **Base branch build**: Sentry finds the corresponding build from your base branch
3. **Comparison**: Sentry compares the two builds
4. **PR comment**: A comment is posted with the size change summary

### Example Status Check

## Troubleshooting

### Not Seeing status checks ?

Check that:

- The Sentry GitHub App is installed and has access to your repository
- You're correctly uploading builds for size analysis from all base branch builds
- You're correctly uploading builds for size analysis from the PR branch.
- Your builds that you want to compare have the same build configuration (for example, both are `Release` builds)
- You're builds contain all the required metadata. TODO link to required metadat

### Missing Base Build?

The first time you set up Size Analysis, your main branch may not have any builds yet:

1. Merge a PR or push to your main branch to trigger a build
2. Future PRs will be able to compare against this base build

## Next Steps

- [Upload your first build](/product/size-analysis/uploading-builds/) to start seeing size analysis
