description: Upload builds to Size Analysis with the Sentry CLI.
---

The Sentry CLI can be used to upload any [accepted mobile build type](/product/size-analysis/uploading-builds/#supported-build-formats).

Set your auth token and use the Sentry CLI to upload iOS or Android builds.

## Set your auth token

```bash
export SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=your-token-here
```

## Upload iOS builds

```bash
sentry-cli build upload app.xcarchive.zip \
  --org your-org \
  --project your-project \
  --build-configuration Release
```

## Upload Android builds

```bash
sentry-cli build upload app.aab \
  --org your-org \
  --project your-project \
  --build-configuration freeRelease # Adjust to your build flavor
```

## GitHub Actions

When you run the CLI in GitHub Actions, metadata like `--repo-name`, `--vcs-provider`, `--pr-number`, `--head-sha`, `--base-sha`, `--head-ref`, and `--base-ref` is filled in automatically. Provide the same flags manually if you upload from another environment.
