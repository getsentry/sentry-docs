description: Upload builds to Size Analysis with the Sentry CLI.
---

The Sentry CLI can be used to upload any [accepted mobile build type](/product/size-analysis/uploading-builds/#supported-build-formats).

<Alert level="info">
  This guide assumes `sentry-cli` is already installed and authenticated. See
  the [installation guide](/cli/installation/) and [configuration
  steps](/cli/configuration/) for initial setup.
</Alert>

## Upload iOS builds

```bash
sentry-cli build upload app.xcarchive.zip \
  --org your-org \
  --project your-project \
  --build-configuration Release
```

## Upload Android builds

```bash
sentry-cli build upload app.aab \
  --org your-org \
  --project your-project \
  --build-configuration freeRelease # Adjust to your build flavor
```

## Required metadata

When you run the CLI in GitHub Actions, metadata like `--repo-name`, `--vcs-provider`, `--pr-number`, `--head-sha`, `--base-sha`, `--head-ref`, and `--base-ref` is filled in automatically. Provide the same flags manually if you upload from another environment.
