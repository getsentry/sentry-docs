This assumes you already have the Sentry Fastlane plugin in your project. See the [Fastlane integration guide](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/apple/guides/ios/upload-debug-symbols/fastlane/) for the full setup.

## Install the plugin

```ruby
bundle exec fastlane add_plugin fastlane-plugin-sentry
```

Ensure the plugin version is `1.34.0` or higher.

## Add a lane

```ruby
lane :upload_to_sentry do
  sentry_upload_build(
    org_slug: 'your-org',
    project_slug: 'your-project',
    build_configuration: 'Release' # Adjust to your configuration
  )
end
```

If you already have a lane, add the `sentry_upload_build` action to it.

## Set your auth token in GitHub Actions

```yaml
env:
  SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN }}
```

## Run the lane

```bash
bundle exec fastlane upload_to_sentry
```
