The Sentry Fastlane plugin can be used to upload any [accepted iOS mobile build type](/product/size-analysis/uploading-builds/#supported-build-formats).

<Alert level="info">
  This guide assumes you already have the Sentry Fastlane plugin in your project
  (version `1.34.0` or higher). See the [Fastlane integration
  guide](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/apple/guides/ios/upload-debug-symbols/fastlane/)
  for initial setup.
</Alert>

## Configure a lane

```ruby
lane :upload_to_sentry do
  sentry_upload_build(
    org_slug: 'your-org',
    project_slug: 'your-project',
    build_configuration: 'Release' # Adjust to your configuration
  )
end
```

If you already have a lane, add the `sentry_upload_build` action to it.

## Run the lane

```bash
bundle exec fastlane upload_to_sentry
```
