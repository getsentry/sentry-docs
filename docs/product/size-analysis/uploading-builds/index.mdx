description: Learn which formats and metadata Size Analysis needs when you upload builds.
---

Every build uploaded to Size Analysis needs a supported archive format and enough metadata for Sentry to compare releases safely.

## Prerequisites

<Include name="size-analysis/prerequisites" />

## Supported Build Formats

<Include name="size-analysis/supported-formats" />

## Upload Tools

Use any of the following guides to configure uploads for your project:

- [Fastlane Setup](/product/size-analysis/uploading-builds/fastlane/)
- [Gradle Setup](/product/size-analysis/uploading-builds/gradle/)
- [CLI Setup](/product/size-analysis/uploading-builds/cli/)

For cross-platform frameworks like React Native or Flutter, you can choose any of the above which work best for your pipeline.

## Upload Metadata

The table shows the minimum fields your upload needs and whether GitHub Actions fills them in automatically. Provide the same values when using a different CI system.
