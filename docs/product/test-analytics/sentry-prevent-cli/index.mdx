  While the snippets below can be used to download and use the CLI directly, it is highly recommended to perform signature and SHASUM verification to ensure integrity of the CLI before use. See [Integrity Checking the Uploader](/product/test-analytics/cli/#integrity-checking-the-uploader) below for more information.
