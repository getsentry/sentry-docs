This step-by-step tutorial walks you through the flow of setting up and configuring your Sentry account to monitor errors in your Python backend application. As part of this tutorial, you will:

- Add basic configurations to the Sentry SDK
- Monitor various types of events and errors to Sentry
- Implement error tracing between your frontend and backend applications

This tutorial uses a [sample Django application](https://github.com/sentry-tutorials/backend-monitoring). This allows us to streamline the steps required to getting the maximum value out of integrating Sentry into your development workflow.

Alternatively, you can follow this guide as a reference and apply the relevant changes directly to your source code.

## Prerequisites

- A [Sentry](https://sentry.io) account, or [sign up](https://sentry.io/signup/) for one
- A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account, or [sign up](https://github.com/join) for one
