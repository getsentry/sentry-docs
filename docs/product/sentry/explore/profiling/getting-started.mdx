Continuous Profiling and UI Profiling are the latest iteration of Sentryâ€™s profiling capabilities, but they are currently only supported in select SDKs as described below. 

Other platforms are supported via the prior transaction-based Profiling product, but these will not benefit from new capabilities introduced by Continuous and UI Profiling (direct start/stop control over the profile lifecycle and removal of duration limits). For more information on the differences between transaction-based Profiling and Continuous/UI Profiling, read [this documentation](/product/explore/profiling/transaction-vs-continuous-profiling).

If you are currently using transaction-based Profiling and want to migrate to Continuous Profiling or UI Profiling on a supported SDK, read the [migration guide](/product/explore/profiling/continuous-ui-profiling-migration-guide).

All SDKs that currently support transaction-based Profiling will be migrated over time to support Continuous Profiling and UI Profiling.

## Supported SDKs

### Continuous Profiling

<Alert>

Continuous Profiling can be used both independently and as a complement to the tracing product.

</Alert>

- Standalone and server apps
  - [Node.js](/platforms/javascript/guides/node/profiling/#enable-continuous-profiling)
  - [Python](/platforms/python/profiling/#enable-continuous-profiling)

### UI Profiling

<Alert>

UI Profiling can be used both independently and as a complement to the tracing product. Support for Browser JavaScript is coming soon.

</Alert>

- Mobile
  - [Android](/platforms/android/profiling/#continuous-profiling)
  - [iOS and macOS](/platforms/apple/guides/ios/profiling/#continuous-profiling)


### Transaction-based Profiling

<Alert>

If Continuous Profiling or UI Profiling are not supported on your SDK, you can fall back to the older transaction-based Profiling implementation for the platforms below.

Transaction-based Profiling requires Sentry's tracing product being enabled beforehand. To enable tracing and performance monitoring features in the SDK, check out our [Insights guide](/product/insights/).
