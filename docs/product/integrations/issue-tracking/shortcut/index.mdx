Create a more efficient workflow by linking your Sentry Issues with your Shortcut Stories. Errors, features, and anything else you track in Shortcut can now live side by side. The new Shortcut integration has feature parity with the Shortcut plugin. If you're choosing between the two, we recommend installing the Shortcut integration.

This integration is maintained and supported by the company that created it. For more details, check out our [Integration Platform documentation](/product/integrations/integration-platform/).

## Install and Configure

<Note>

Sentry owner, manager, or admin permissions are required to install this integration.
