Build Distribution enables you to securely distribute app builds to your internal teams and beta testers. Upload builds from CI to streamline your distribution workflow, manage access control, and track installation analytics.

### CI Integration

Integrate Build Distribution into your CI pipeline to automatically distribute builds to your teams.

## Upload Guides

You can follow the platform guides to learn how to upload builds for distribution:

- [iOS](/platforms/apple/guides/ios/build-distribution/)
- [Android](/platforms/android/build-distribution/)

### Upload Metadata

Below is the metadata included in your build, regardless of the platform.

## Install Groups

Install groups let you tag builds with one or more group names to control update visibility. When a device checks for updates, only builds that share at least one install group with the currently installed build will be returned as available updates.

This is useful when you have multiple distribution channels (for example, separate branches, teams, or rollout stages) and want to prevent builds from one channel from being offered as updates to another.

### How It Works

When you upload a build, you can assign one or more install groups to it. When the Auto-Update SDK checks for updates:

1. If the currently installed build has install groups, only builds with at least one matching group are considered.
2. If no install groups are set, all builds for that app and build configuration are eligible.

Matching uses **OR logic** — a build only needs to share _one_ group to be considered a valid update. For example, a build tagged `["alpha", "staging"]` will see updates from a build tagged `["alpha", "beta"]` because both share `alpha`.

### Use Cases

- **Branch-based testing**: Tag CI builds with the branch name so developers only receive updates from their own branch.
- **Staged rollouts**: Use groups like `"alpha"`, `"beta"`, and `"internal"` to control which teams receive which builds.
- **Team separation**: Give each team its own install group so they only see builds relevant to them.

For platform-specific setup instructions, see:

- [Android Install Groups](/platforms/android/build-distribution/install-groups/)
