Contributing
============

Code Review
-----------

Code review is mandatory at Sentry. This adds overhead to each change, but ensures
that simple, often overlooked problems are more easily avoided.

Code review is managed via GitHub's Pull Requests (see below for rationale).
Templates may exist on repositories, if they do not, consider
`creating one <https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository/>`_.

When creating a pull request, reference any tickets or Sentry issues which are
being addressed. Additionally **@mention** an appropriate team (or teams) for review.

GitHub Teams
''''''''''''

The following teams are defined in GitHub and should be used when creating Pull Requests:

- `@getsentry/api <https://github.com/orgs/getsentry/teams/api>`_
- `@getsentry/ui <https://github.com/orgs/getsentry/teams/ui>`_
- `@getsentry/infrastructure <https://github.com/orgs/getsentry/teams/infrastructure>`_
- `@getsentry/ops <https://github.com/orgs/getsentry/teams/ops>`_
- `@getsentry/team <https://github.com/orgs/getsentry/teams/team>`_ -- the entire product team, use sparingly

Additionally, language specific teams exist, primarily for SDKs:

- `@getsentry/cocoa <https://github.com/orgs/getsentry/teams/cocoa>`_
- `@getsentry/java <https://github.com/orgs/getsentry/teams/java>`_
- `@getsentry/javascript <https://github.com/orgs/getsentry/teams/javascript>`_
- `@getsentry/php <https://github.com/orgs/getsentry/teams/php>`_
- `@getsentry/python <https://github.com/orgs/getsentry/teams/python>`_

Why Pull Requests
'''''''''''''''''

Because Sentry is an open source project maintained via GitHub we want to ensure that
the barrier to entry for external contributions is minimal. By using GitHub features
when possible, we make it easy for developers familiar with other projects on GitHub.
While GitHub's tools `aren't always the best <http://cra.mr/2014/05/03/on-pull-requests>`_,
they're usable enough that we'll make do.

Commit Guidelines
-----------------

We have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted.
This leads to more readable messages that are easy to follow when looking
through the project history.

General Rules
'''''''''''''

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 70 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
7. Each commit should be a single, stable change

Merge vs Rebase
'''''''''''''''

Sentry uses a rebase workflow. That means that every commit on its own should
be a clear, functional, and stable change. This means then when you're building
a new feature, you should try to pare it down into functional steps, and when
that's not reasonable, the end patch should be a single commit. This is counter
to having a Pull Request which may include "fix [unmerged] behavior". Those
commits should get squashed, and the final patch when landed should be rebased.

Remember: each commit should follow the commit message format and be stable
(green build).

Rebase and Merge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The GitHub UI exposes a "Rebase and Merge" option, which, if your commits are
already in following the commit guidelines, is a great way to bring your change
into the codebase.

Squashing
~~~~~~~~~

If you are squashing your branch, it's important to make sure you update the
commit message. If you're using GitHub's UI it will by default create a new
commit message which is a combination of all commits and **does not follow the
commit guidelines**.

If you're working locally, it often can be useful to ``--amend`` a commit, or
utilize ``rebase -i`` to reorder, squash, and reword your commits.

Commit Message Format
'''''''''''''''''''''

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body**, and an optional
**footer**.

The header has a special format that includes a type, a scope and a subject::

    <type>(<scope>): <subject>
    <BLANK LINE>
    <body>
    <BLANK LINE>
    <footer>

The **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the
message to be easier to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.

The footer should contain a closing reference to an issue as well as a relevant
Sentry issue if any.

For example::

    feat(stream): Add resolve in next release action

    Expose a new action labeled 'resolve in next release'. It uses the existing API
    behavior and sends the 'inNextRelease=true' payload.

    Fixes GH-1234

As well as::

    fix(stream): Handle empty reference on resolve action

    Gracefully handle when a user has not selected any issues and tries to complete
    the resolve action in the UI.

    Fixes GH-1234
    Fixes SENTRY-1234

Revert
~~~~~~

If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with ``revert:``,
followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say:
``This reverts commit <hash>.``, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being
reverted.

Type
~~~~

Must be one of the following:

:build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example
        scopes: webpack, python, npm)
:ci:    Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes:
        travis, zeus)
:docs:  Documentation only changes
:feat:  A new feature
:fix:   A bug fix
:perf:  A code change that improves performance
:ref:   A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature (refactor)
:style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space,
        formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
:test:  Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

Scope
~~~~~

The scope should be the name of the core component affected (as perceived by
person reading changelog generated from commit messages). This means it should
be the system impacted, not the literal file changed. For example, if the code
primarily affects billing, youâ€™d use the `billing` scope, even if the changes
are in utility files or db schema.

The following is the list of suggested scopes:

- **api**
- **billing**
- **workflow**

Subject
~~~~~~~

The subject contains a succinct description of the change:

- Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- Don't capitalize the first letter
- No dot (.) at the end

Body
~~~~

Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not
"changed" nor "changes". The body should include the motivation for the change
and contrast this with previous behavior.

Footer
~~~~~~

The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is
also the place to reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.

Breaking Changes should start with the word ``BREAKING CHANGE:`` with a space or
two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.
