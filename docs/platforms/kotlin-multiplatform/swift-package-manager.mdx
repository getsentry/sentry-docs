Swift Package Manager is a powerful tool for managing dependencies in Swift that allows developers to enjoy a more native integration experience with Xcode.
If you already use Swift Package Manager or prefer it over other package managers on Apple platforms, this guide will show you how to install the Kotlin Multiplatform SDK using Swift Package Manager.

<Note>
Adding third party dependencies through Swift Package Manager in libraries such as the Sentry SDK is not yet officially supported in the Kotlin Multiplatform ecosystem and might not be compatible in more advanced use cases. We recommend [installing our SDK with Cocoapods](/platforms/kotlin-multiplatform/#install) for the best compatibility and experience with Kotlin Multiplatform.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Ensure compatibility in Kotlin Multiplatform projects targeting Cocoa by using the version of the Cocoa SDK specified in our [Cocoa SDK Version Compatibility Table](/platforms/kotlin-multiplatform/#cocoa-sdk-version-compatibility-table).

### Export framework statically

Make sure your Kotlin Multiplatform framework is exported as a static framework by adding `isStatic = true`

## Install

Add the Sentry Cocoa SDK as a package in Xcode in your iOS app via **File > Add Packages**.
Enter the Git repo URL in the search field:

```text
https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa.git
```

Define your dependency rule to have the exact version `8.20.0` and then click the "Add Package" button.

Alternatively, if your project uses a `Package.swift` file to manage dependencies, you can specify the target with:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
.package(url: "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa", from: "8.20.0"),
```

Next, install the Kotlin Multiplatform SDK and setup your Apple targets by adding the following to your `build.gradle.kts` file in your shared module:

```kotlin {filename:shared/build.gradle.kts}
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

kotlin {
  listOf(
    iosX64(),
    iosArm64(),
    iosSimulatorArm64()
  ).forEach {
    it.binaries.framework {
        baseName = "shared"
        isStatic = true // currently available only as static framework
    }
  }

  sourceSets {
    val commonMain by getting {
      dependencies {
        implementation("io.sentry:sentry-kotlin-multiplatform:{{@inject packages.version('sentry.kotlin.kmp', '0.0.1-alpha.2') }}")
      }
    }

    // Apple targets:
    val iosMain by getting {
      dependsOn(commonMain)
    }

    // Other targets...
  }
}
```

## Running Tests

If you configured the Sentry Kotlin Multiplatform SDK with Swift Package Manager and try running tests, it won't work out of the box and you'll encounter the following error: `ld: framework 'Sentry' not found`.

Follow these steps for the workaround:

### 1. Download the Sentry xcframework

Choose the release based on the version specified in the version compatibility table, download the `Sentry.xcframework.zip`, and unzip it.

### 2. Create Frameworks directory and insert Sentry.framework

Create a `/Frameworks` directory in the directory where the `test.kexe` resides. Put the `Sentry.framework` into it. (The `Sentry.framework` can be found inside of the `ios-arm64_x86_64-simulator`.)
The `test.kexe` will usually reside in `build/bin/iosSimulatorArm64/debugTest`.

### 3. Add the linker options

```kotlin {filename:shared/build.gradle.kts}
  listOf(
      iosX64(),
      iosArm64(),
      iosSimulatorArm64(),
  ).forEach {
      it.binaries.framework {
          baseName = "shared"
          isStatic = true
      }
      it.compilations.all {
          if (compilationName == "test" && target.platformType == KotlinPlatformType.native) {
              compilerOptions.configure {
                  freeCompilerArgs.add("-linker-options")
                  freeCompilerArgs.add("-F/your/path/Carthage/Build/Sentry.xcframework/ios-arm64_x86_64-simulator/")
              }
          }
      }
  }
```

### 4. Run the tests

Now your tests should run successfully.
