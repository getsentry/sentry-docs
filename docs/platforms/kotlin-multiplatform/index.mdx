## Configure

Configuration should happen as early as possible in your application's lifecycle.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-config" />

## Verify

This snippet includes an intentional error, so you can test that everything is working as soon as you set it up.

## Apple Installation Methods

### Swift Package Manager (SPM)

Swift Package Manager (SPM) is a powerful tool for managing dependencies in Swift that allows developers to enjoy a more native integration experience with Xcode.
If you already use SPM or prefer it over other package managers on Apple platforms, this guide will show you how to install the Kotlin Multiplatform SDK while using Swift Package Manager.

#### Install

In order to install the Sentry Kotlin Multiplatform SDK, you need to use Cocoapods and Swift Package Manager simultaneously which might seem unconventional at first, especially if you're accustomed to using SPM for all your dependencies. However, you can achieve a smooth integration by using the Kotlin Cocoapods plugin specifically for compiling and building the shared framework. You can then continue to manage all other dependencies with SPM as usual.

Follow the steps for our primary installation method [CocoaPods](/platforms/kotlin-multiplatform/#install) to install the Sentry Kotlin Multiplatform SDK.

After you've consumed the shared framework in your application via Cocoapods, you can continue with SPM for other dependencies without disrupting your existing workflow.
