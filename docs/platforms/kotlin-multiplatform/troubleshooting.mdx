## "Missing API declaration" after App Store review

Starting May 1, 2024, Apple requires all apps submitted to the App Store to provide a list of privacy-related APIs they use, including the reasons under which they use it. If you received an email from Apple with the message "ITMS-91053: Missing API declaration", your app doesn't fulfill the requirements. To solve this, follow our [Apple Privacy Manifest](/platforms/kotlin-multiplatform/data-management/apple-privacy-manifest) guide.
