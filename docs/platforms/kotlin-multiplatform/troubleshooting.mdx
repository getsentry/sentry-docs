This document covers common issues you may encounter when using the Sentry Kotlin Multiplatform SDK and provides steps to troubleshoot.

## "Missing API declaration" after App Store review

Starting May 1, 2024, Apple requires all apps submitted to the App Store to provide a list of privacy-related APIs they use, including the reasons under which they use it. If you received an email from Apple with the message "ITMS-91053: Missing API declaration", your app doesn't fulfill the requirements. To solve this, follow our [Apple Privacy Manifest](/platforms/kotlin-multiplatform/data-management/apple-privacy-manifest) guide.

## Tests Not Working

If you configured the Sentry Kotlin Multiplatform SDK and tests are still failing with the following error: `ld: framework 'Sentry' not found` then follow these steps for the workaround:

<Note>
This example shows you how to fix the issue for the iOS simulator target, but the same approach can be used for other targets.
</Note>

**1. Download the Sentry xcframework**

- Choose the Sentry Cocoa release based on the version specified in the [version compatibility table](/platforms/kotlin-multiplatform/#cocoa-sdk-version-compatibility-table)
- Download the `Sentry.xcframework.zip` on [GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/releases), and unzip it.

**2. Create a frameworks directory and insert `Sentry.framework`**

Create a `/Frameworks` directory in the directory where the `test.kexe` resides and put the `Sentry.framework` in it.
- The `Sentry.framework` can be found inside of the `ios-arm64_x86_64-simulator`.
- The `test.kexe` will usually reside in `build/bin/iosSimulatorArm64/debugTest`.

**3. Add linker options**

Modify `shared/build.gradle.kts` to include linker options, as shown below:

```kotlin {filename:shared/build.gradle.kts}
  listOf(
      iosX64(),
      iosArm64(),
      iosSimulatorArm64(),
  ).forEach {
      it.binaries.framework {
          baseName = "shared"
      }
      it.compilations.all {
          if (compilationName == "test" && target.platformType == KotlinPlatformType.native) {
              compilerOptions.configure {
                  freeCompilerArgs.add("-linker-options")
                  freeCompilerArgs.add("-F/your/path/Carthage/Build/Sentry.xcframework/ios-arm64_x86_64-simulator/")
              }
          }
      }
  }
```

**4. Run the tests**
