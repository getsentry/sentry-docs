Additional steps are required to be able to export for Android with Sentry integration.

## Setting up export for Android

If you haven't exported for Android before, follow the [Godot Android export guide](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/exporting_for_android.html) to configure your Android SDK and Java SDK paths in Godot's Editor Settings.

### Step 1: Install Gradle Build Template

Exporting for Android with Sentry SDK requires using Godot's Gradle build system. By default, Godot doesn't use Gradle build, so it needs to be enabled.

If you haven't already, you need to install the Android build template first. Go to `Project -> Install Android Build Template...` in the Godot editor and click "Install" in the confirmation dialog. This creates a Gradle-based Android project under `res://android/build/` in your project directory. The Sentry SDK will automatically integrate with this Gradle project.

### Step 2: Configure Android Export

1. **Create Export Preset**: If you don't have an export preset, you need to create one: go to `Project -> Export...` and add a new Android export preset.
2. **Enable Gradle Build**: In the export preset, go to `Options -> Gradle Build` and enable the `Use Gradle Build` option.
3. **Configure Other Settings**: Set up your package name, icons, permissions, and other Android-specific settings as needed.

### Step 3: Export Your Project

Once configured, export your project normally. During export, Godot will automatically:
- Generate fresh templates using the Gradle build system
- Include Sentry SDK dependencies in the Gradle configuration
- Build your APK/AAB with Sentry integration

## Known Limitations

While the Android support is comprehensive, there are some current limitations:

- Automatic screenshots on crashes are not yet supported on Android. ([#238](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/issues/238))
- Local variable values in GDScript stack traces are not currently captured. ([#232](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-godot/issues/232))

These limitations will be addressed in future versions of the SDK.
