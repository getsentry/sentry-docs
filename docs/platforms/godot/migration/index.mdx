## Migrating to 1.0.0

### Breaking changes

The minimum supported Godot Engine version has been updated to `4.5-stable`. This requirement will remain fixed for the `1.x` release series. The log file is no longer required for script error detection.

We redesigned breadcrumbs API for a cleaner interface. See [Changes to breadcrumbs API](#changes-to-breadcrumbs-api) below.

Configuration script support and `SentryConfiguration` class are removed. Instead, please use manual initialization with a configuration callback, if you need to set up SDK from code. See [Changes to programmatic configuration](#changes-to-programmatic-configuration) below.

The `attach_screenshot` and `screenshot_level` options have moved to the experimental section while we're still improving things. If you previously had it enabled, you will need to re-enable it in its new location. Testing is recommended if you want to use this in production.

`enabled` and `disabled_in_editor_play` project settings were renamed to `auto_init` and `skip_auto_init_on_editor_play` for clarity.


### Changes to breadcrumbs API

Previously, `add_breadcrumb()` method accepted 5 parameters (3 of which were strings), making it confusing to use. The new approach uses a dedicated `SentryBreadcrumb` class:

```gdscript
var crumb := SentryBreadcrumb.create("Something happened")
crumb.type = "info"
crumb.set_data({"some": "data"})
SentrySDK.add_breadcrumb(crumb)
```

For simple breadcrumbs, you can use a one-liner:
```gdscript
SentrySDK.add_breadcrumb(SentryBreadcrumb.create("Something happened"))
```

### Changes to programmatic configuration

Configuration scripts and the `SentryConfiguration` class have been removed. To configure the SDK programmatically, you must initialize it manually. The earliest point for initialization is within the `MainLoop._initialize()` method. Here's how you can do it:

1. Disable **Auto Init** in Godot's **Project Settings** window under **Sentry** category.
2. Create a main loop script with a `class_name` attribute, and init Sentry inside `_initialize()` method.
```gdscript
class_name MyMainLoop
extends SceneTree

func _initialize() -> void:
	# Sentry initialization
	SentrySDK.init(func(options: SentryOptions) -> void:
		options.release = "my-game@1.2.3"
		options.before_send = _before_send
	)

	# Post-init configuration
	SentrySDK.add_attachment(...)
	# ...

func _before_send(ev: SentryEvent) -> SentryEvent:
	# Return the event (with or without modifications) or null to skip reporting.
	return ev
```
3. Assign your main loop type in the **Project Settings** window under **Application > Run > Main Loop Type** ("MyMainLoop" in the example code).
