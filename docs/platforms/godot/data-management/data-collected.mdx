Sentry takes data privacy very seriously and has default settings in place that prioritize data safety, especially when it comes to personally identifiable information (PII) data. When you add the Sentry SDK to your application, you allow it to collect data and send it to Sentry during the runtime of your application.

The category types and amount of data collected vary, depending on the integrations you've enabled in the Sentry SDK. Here's a list of data categories the Sentry Native SDK collects:

## User Information

By default, the Sentry SDK doesn't send any information about users, such as email address, user ID, or username. However, if the <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#send-default-pii">`send_default_pii` option</PlatformLink> is enabled, Sentry backend services will infer the user's IP address based on the incoming request.

You can also set user information from code:

```GDScript
var user := SentryUser.new()
user.id = "custom_id"
user.email = "bob@example.com"
user.username = "bob"
user.ip_address = "127.0.0.1"
SentrySDK.set_user(user)
```

## Device Information

The Sentry SDK collects information about the device, such as the name, version and build of your operating system or Linux distribution. This information is sent to Sentry by default.

## Screenshots

The <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/screenshots">screenshot feature</PlatformLink> is disabled by default. If you choose to enable this feature in options, any screenshots captured may contain sensitive data visible in the application at the time of the error.

## Godot Log File

By default, the Sentry SDK automatically attaches the Godot log file to events it sends. Since this log file contains all messages printed in your code and by the engine itself, it may inadvertently include sensitive information. To enhance privacy protection, you can disable the <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#attach-log">`attach_log` option</PlatformLink> in the Godot Project Settings.

## Thread Stack Information

At the time of a crash, the stack of each thread is collected and sent to Sentry as part of the Minidump snapshot for `crashpad` backend. This information is sent to Sentry by default, but dropped after processing the event in the backend.

These files are not stored by default, but you can <PlatformLink to="/data-management/store-minidumps-as-attachments/">enable Minidump Storage</PlatformLink> in the Sentry organization or project settings.
