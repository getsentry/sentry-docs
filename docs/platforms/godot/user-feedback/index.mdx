Sentry makes it possible to collect user feedback, and optionally associate it with an error event.

## User Feedback API

The User Feedback API allows you to collect user feedback while using your own UI controls. You can submit feedback directly by creating an instance of `SentryFeedback` class, setting the required `message` and optional fields, then submitting it using `SentrySDK.capture_feedback(feedback)`.

Sentry can optionally pair this feedback with an event, giving you additional insight into issues. Sentry needs the `event_id` to be able to associate the user feedback to the corresponding event. For example, to get the `event_id`, you can use <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#before-send">before_send</PlatformLink>, or the return value of the method capturing an event.

```GDScript
var feedback := SentryFeedback.new()
feedback.message = "I'm stuck in the wall!"
feedback.contact_email = "bob@example.com"
feedback.name = "Bob"

# Optionally, associate the feedback with an event
# feedback.associated_event_id = event_id

SentrySDK.capture_feedback(feedback)
```
