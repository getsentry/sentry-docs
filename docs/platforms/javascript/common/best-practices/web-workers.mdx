Sentry's Browser SDK supports [Web Workers API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API). To capture unhandled errors from Web Workers:

Install `@sentry/browser` using your package manager:

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install @sentry/browser --save
```

```bash {tabTitle:yarn}
yarn add @sentry/browser
```

```bash {tabTitle:pnpm}
pnpm add @sentry/browser
```

Then you can use it:

<SignInNote />

```javascript {filename:index.js}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
});

const worker = new Worker("worker.js");

// Errors from `onmessage` callback of `worker.js`
// will be captured.
worker.postMessage("Hello!");
```

<Alert level="warning" title="Manual Capturing">

To capture errors or messages manually, such as to use `captureMessage` or `captureException` inside Web Workers, Sentry should be initialized inside each Web Workers' own scope. Only unhandled errors will be captured and sent to Sentry without worker-level initialization.

</Alert>

#### Usage Without Worker-Level Initialization

```javascript {filename:worker.js}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";

self.onmessage = (message) => {
  // This will fail silently.
  Sentry.captureMessage("Message received");

  // This error will be captured.
  throw new Error();
};
```

#### Usage With Worker-Level Initialization

<SignInNote />

```javascript {filename:worker.js}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
});

self.onmessage = (message) => {
  // This message will be captured
  Sentry.captureMessage("Message received");

  // This error will also be captured.
  throw new Error();
};
```

### Integrations

Note, that if you use non-default integrations inside web workers, they may not function as expected. But non-default integrations that are enabled outside of a worker’s scope won’t be affected and will function as expected. This includes Session Replay.

### Source Maps

Sentry's source maps integration is supported inside Web Workers, if provided. Learn more about providing your [source maps](/platforms/javascript/sourcemaps/) to Sentry.
