When setting up Sentry in a shared environment where multiple Sentry instances may run, for example, in a browser extension or similar, you should **not use `Sentry.init()`**, as this will pollute the global state. If your browser extension uses `Sentry.init()`, and the website the extension is running on also uses Sentry, the extension may send events to the website's Sentry project, or vice versa.

For such scenarios, you have to set up a client manually as seen in the example below.
In addition, you should also avoid adding any integrations that use global state, like `Breadcrumbs` or `GlobalHandlers`. Furthermore, some default integrations that use the global state have to be filtered as in the example below.
As a rule of thumb, it's best to avoid using any integrations and to rely on manual capture of errors only in such scenarios.

<SignInNote />

```javascript
import {
  BrowserClient,
  defaultStackParser,
  getDefaultIntegrations,
  makeFetchTransport,
  Scope,
} from "@sentry/browser";

// filter integrations that use the global variable
const integrations = getDefaultIntegrations().filter(defaultIntegration => {
  return !['BrowserApiErrors', 'TryCatch', 'Breadcrumbs', 'GlobalHandlers'].includes(defaultIntegration.name);
});

const client = new BrowserClient({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  transport: makeFetchTransport,
  stackParser: defaultStackParser,
  integrations: integrations,
});

const scope = new Scope();
scope.setClient(client);

client.init() // initializing has to be done after setting the client on the scope

// You can capture exceptions manually for this client like this:
scope.captureException(new Error("example"));

```

If you notice that Sentry is not capturing error events from the browser extension,
try disabling the Browser extension errors option in the Inbound Filters of your Sentry configuration.
Read more about Inbound Filters in the product documentation under [Inbound filters](/product/data-management-settings/filtering/#inbound-data-filters).
