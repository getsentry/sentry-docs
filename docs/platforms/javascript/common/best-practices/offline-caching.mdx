If your JavaScript application is designed to continue working offline,
dropping events when no connection is available and missing
offline events, could mean you're missing important information.

To enable offline events caching, use `makeBrowserOfflineTransport` to wrap existing transports and queue events
using the browsers' IndexedDB storage. Once your application comes back online, all events will be sent together.

<PlatformContent includePath="configuration/offline" />

Here are a few optional properties you can add to `transportOptions`:

```javascript
transportOptions:{
  /**
   * Name of IndexedDb database to store events
   * Default: 'sentry-offline'
   */
  dbName: string;
  /**
   * Name of IndexedDb object store to store events
   * Default: 'queue'
   */
  storeName: string;
  /**
   * Maximum number of events to store
   * Default: 30
   */
  maxQueueSize: number;
  /**
   * Flush the store shortly after startup.
   * Default: false
   */
  flushAtStartup: boolean;
  /**
   * Called before an event is stored.
   * Return false to drop the envelope rather than store it.
   *
   * @param envelope The envelope that failed to send.
   * @param error The error that occurred.
   * @param retryDelay The current retry delay in milliseconds.
   */
  shouldStore: (envelope: Envelope, error: Error, retryDelay: number) => boolean | Promise<boolean>;
}
```

#### Browser Support

Offline caching is not supported in IE due to a lack of IndexedDB features.
