If your frontend includes JavaScript bundles from multiple sources with
different release cycles, you may want to identify these or route events to specific projects. This is especially useful if you've set up [module federation](https://module-federation.github.io/) or a similar frontend architecture.

Below we offer two approaches.

<Note>
  In all cases `Sentry.init()` must never be called more than once, doing so
  will result in undefined behavior.
</Note>

## Automatically Route Errors to Different Projects Depending on Module

`ModuleMetadata` and `makeMultiplexedTransport` can be used together to automatically route
events to different Sentry projects based on the module where the error
occurred.

<Note>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Requires version `2.18.0` or higher of `@sentry/webpack-plugin`,
      `@sentry/rollup-plugin`, `@sentry/vite-plugin` or
      `@sentry/esbuild-plugin`.
    </li>
    <li>Requires SDK version `7.59.0` or higher.</li>
  </ul>
</Note>

First, to identify the source of an error, you must inject metadata that helps identify
which bundles were responsible for the error. You can do this with any of the
Sentry bundler plugins by enabling the `moduleMetadata` option. The example
below is for Webpack, but this is also supported in Vite, Rollup, and esbuild.

```javascript
// webpack.config.js
const { sentryWebpackPlugin } = require("@sentry/webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  devtool: "source-map",
  plugins: [
    sentryWebpackPlugin({
      moduleMetadata: ({ release }) => ({ dsn: "__MODULE_DSN__", release }),
    }),
  ],
};
```

Once metadata has been injected into modules, the `moduleMetadataIntegration`
can be used to look up that metadata and attach it to stack frames with
matching file names. This metadata is then available in the `beforeSend` callback
as the `module_metadata` property on each `StackFrame`. This can be used to identify
which bundles may be responsible for an error. Once the destination is determined, you can
store it as a list of DSN-release pairs in `event.extra[MULTIPLEXED_TRANSPORT_EXTRA_KEY]`
for the multiplexed transport to reference for routing.

In practice, here is what your Sentry initialization should look like:

```javascript
import {
  init,
  makeFetchTransport,
  moduleMetadataIntegration,
  makeMultiplexedTransport,
} from "@sentry/browser";

const EXTRA_KEY = "ROUTE_TO";

const transport = makeMultiplexedTransport(makeFetchTransport, (args) => {
  const event = args.getEvent();
  if (
    event &&
    event.extra &&
    EXTRA_KEY in event.extra &&
    Array.isArray(event.extra[EXTRA_KEY])
  ) {
    return event.extra[EXTRA_KEY];
  }
  return [];
});

init({
  dsn: "__DEFAULT_DSN__",
  integrations: [moduleMetadataIntegration()],
  transport,
  beforeSend: (event) => {
    if (event?.exception?.values?.[0].stacktrace.frames) {
      const frames = event.exception.values[0].stacktrace.frames;
      // Find the last frame with module metadata containing a DSN
      const routeTo = frames
        .filter((frame) => frame.module_metadata && frame.module_metadata.dsn)
        .map((v) => v.module_metadata)
        .slice(-1); // using top frame only - you may want to customize this according to your needs

      if (routeTo.length) {
        event.extra = {
          ...event.extra,
          [EXTRA_KEY]: routeTo,
        };
      }
    }

    return event;
  },
});
```

Once this is set up, errors - both handled and unhandled - will be automatically routed to the right project.

<Note>

By default, `args.getEvent` returns only error events. You can match against other event types like so: `args.getEvent(['event', 'transaction', 'replay_event'])`. This `getEvent` snippet
will return matches for errors, transactions, and replays.

</Note>

## Manually Route Errors to Different Projects

If, however, you would like to have more control over the routing of errors to the point
where you explicitly specify the destination for each individual `captureException`,
you can do that with the more advanced interface multiplexed transport offers.

<Note>Requires SDK version `7.59.0` or higher.</Note>

The example below uses a `feature` tag to determine which Sentry project to
send the event to. If the event does not have a `feature` tag, we send it to the
fallback DSN defined in `Sentry.init`.

```typescript
import { captureException, init, makeFetchTransport } from "@sentry/browser";
import { makeMultiplexedTransport } from "@sentry/core";
import { Envelope, EnvelopeItemType } from "@sentry/types";

interface MatchParam {
  /** The envelope to be sent */
  envelope: Envelope;
  /**
   * A function that returns an event from the envelope if one exists. You can optionally pass an array of envelope item
   * types to filter by - only envelopes matching the given types will be returned.
   *
   * @param types Defaults to ['event'] (only error events will be returned)
   */
  getEvent(types?: EnvelopeItemType[]): Event | undefined;
}

function dsnFromFeature({ getEvent }: MatchParam) {
  const event = getEvent();
  switch (event?.tags?.feature) {
    case "cart":
      return [{ dsn: "__CART_DSN__", release: "cart@1.0.0" }];
    case "gallery":
      return [{ dsn: "__GALLERY_DSN__", release: "gallery@1.2.0" }];
    default:
      return [];
  }
}

init({
  dsn: "__FALLBACK_DSN__",
  transport: makeMultiplexedTransport(makeFetchTransport, dsnFromFeature),
});
```

You can then set tags/contexts on events in individual micro-frontends to decide which Sentry project to send the event to as follows:

<Note>
  It is important to always use a local scope when setting the tag (either as
  shown below or using{" "}
  <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/scopes/#local-scopes">
    withScope documentation
  </PlatformLink>
  ). Using a global scope e.g. through `Sentry.setTag()` will result in all subsequent
  events being routed to the same DSN regardless of where they originate.
</Note>

```typescript
captureException(new Error("oh no!"), (scope) => {
  scope.setTag("feature", "cart");
  return scope;
});
```
