Adding Sentry to your app gives you a great deal of very valuable information about errors and performance you wouldn't otherwise get. And lots of information is good -- as long as it's the right information, at a reasonable volume.

## Sampling Error Events

To send a representative sample of your errors to Sentry, set the <PlatformIdentifier name="sample-rate" /> option in your SDK configuration to a number between `0` (0% of errors sent) and `1` (100% of errors sent). This is a static rate, which will apply equally to all errors. For example, to sample 25% of your errors:

<PlatformContent includePath="configuration/sample-rate" />

The error sample rate defaults to `1`, meaning all errors are sent to Sentry.

<Note>

Changing the error sample rate requires re-deployment. In addition, setting an SDK sample rate limits visibility into the source of events. Setting a rate limit for your project (which only drops events when volume is high) may better suit your needs.

## Sampling Transaction Events

We recommend sampling your transactions for two reasons:

1. Capturing a single trace involves minimal overhead, but capturing traces for _every_ page load or _every_ API request may add an undesirable load to your system.
2. Enabling sampling allows you to better manage the number of events sent to Sentry, so you can tailor your volume to your organization's needs.

Choose a sampling rate with the goal of finding a balance between performance and volume concerns with data accuracy. You don't want to collect _too_ much data, but you want to collect sufficient data from which to draw meaningful conclusions. If youâ€™re not sure what rate to choose, start with a low value and gradually increase it as you learn more about your traffic patterns and volume.

## Configuring the Transaction Sample Rate

The Sentry SDKs have two configuration options to control the volume of transactions sent to Sentry, allowing you to take a representative sample:

1. Uniform sample rate (<PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" />):

   - Provides an even cross-section of transactions, no matter where in your app or under what circumstances they occur.
   - Uses default [inheritance](#inheritance) and [precedence](#precedence) behavior

2. Sampling function (<PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" />) which:
   - Samples different transactions at different rates
   - <PlatformLink to="/configuration/filtering/">Filters</PlatformLink> out some
     transactions entirely
   - Modifies default [precedence](#precedence) and [inheritance](#inheritance) behavior

By default, none of these options are set, meaning no transactions will be sent to Sentry. You must set either one of the options to start sending transactions.

## Sampling Context Data

When a span is started, the `tracesSampler` function will automatically receive the span `name` and the initial span `attributes` to use in its sampling decision. Additionally, it will also receive a `parentSampled` boolean indicating whether the parent span was sampled. This data can be used to make a more informed decision about whether to sample the span.

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/custom-sampling-context" />

Please note that the `name` passed to `tracesSampler` may not be the exact same name that is eventually sent to Sentry. The name may be updated during the lifetime of the span, but the `name` passed to `tracesSampler` will always be the initial name. For example, the `name` for `http.server` spans will usually not be parametrized yet when passed to `tracesSampler`, so instead of `GET /users/:id` you may see a name of `GET /users/123`.

## Inheritance

Whatever a transaction's sampling decision, that decision will be passed to its child spans and from there to any transactions they subsequently cause in other services.

<PlatformSection notSupported={["javascript.cordova"]}>

(See <PlatformLink to="/tracing/trace-propagation/">Distributed Tracing</PlatformLink> for more about how that propagation is done.)

</PlatformSection>

If the transaction currently being created is one of those subsequent transactions (in other words, if it has a parent transaction), the upstream (parent) sampling decision will be included in the sampling context data. Your <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> can use this information to choose whether to inherit that decision. In most cases, inheritance is the right choice, to avoid breaking distributed traces. A broken trace will not include all your services.

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/always-inherit-sampling-decision">

In some SDKs, for convenience, the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> function can return a boolean, so that a parent's decision can be returned directly if that's the desired behavior.

</PlatformContent>

If you're using a <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> rather than a <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" />, the decision will always be inherited.

## Precedence

There are multiple ways for a transaction to end up with a sampling decision.

- Random sampling according to a static sample rate set in <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" />
- Random sampling according to a sample function rate returned by <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" />
- Absolute decision (100% chance or 0% chance) returned by <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" />
- If the transaction has a parent, inheriting its parent's sampling decision
- Absolute decision passed to <PlatformIdentifier name="start-transaction" />

When there's the potential for more than one of these to come into play, the following precedence rules apply:

1. If a sampling decision is passed to <PlatformIdentifier name="start-transaction" />, that decision will be used, overriding everything else.
1. If <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> is defined, its decision will be used. It can choose to keep or ignore any parent sampling decision, use the sampling context data to make its own decision, or choose a sample rate for the transaction. We advise against overriding the parent sampling decision because it will break distributed traces)
1. If <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> is not defined, but there's a parent sampling decision, the parent sampling decision will be used.
1. If <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> is not defined and there's no parent sampling decision, <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> will be used.
