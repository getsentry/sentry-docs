The JavaScript SDK uses a `transport` to send events to Sentry. On modern browsers, most transports use the browsers' `fetch` API to send events. Transports will drop an event if it fails to send due to a lack of connection.

You can change the transport by setting the `transport` option in the `init` call. The SDK provides a few built-in transports, and you can also create your own.

## `makeBrowserOfflineTransport`

The `makeBrowserOfflineTransport` transport is a built-in transport that uses the `IndexedDB` API to store events when the browser is offline. When the browser comes back online, the transport sends the stored events to Sentry. <PlatformLink to="/best-pracises/offline-caching">Read more about how to use it.</PlatformLink>

## Custom transport

You can also provide a custom transport to Sentry. The transport must conform to the `Transport` interface:

```javascript
interface Transport {
  send(request: Envelope): Promise<TransportMakeRequestResponse>;
  flush(timeout?: number): Promise<boolean>;
}
```

You can also use the `createTransport` utility from `@sentry/core` to help with some boilerplate:

```javascript
import { createTransport } from '@sentry/core';
import * from '@sentry/browser';

function makeFetchTransport(
  options
): Transport {
  function makeRequest(request) {
    const requestOptions: RequestInit = {
      body: request.body,
      method: 'POST',
      referrerPolicy: 'origin',
      headers: options.headers,
      ...options.fetchOptions,
    };

    return fetch(options.url, requestOptions).then(response => {
      return {
        statusCode: response.status,
        headers: {
          'x-sentry-rate-limits': response.headers.get('X-Sentry-Rate-Limits'),
          'retry-after': response.headers.get('Retry-After'),
        },
      };
    });
  }

  return createTransport(options, makeRequest);
}

Sentry.init({
  dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
  transport: makeFetchTransport
});
```
