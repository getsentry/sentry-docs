<Alert level="info">

This integration only works inside a browser environment.

</Alert>

The [LaunchDarkly](https://launchdarkly.com/) integration tracks feature flag evaluations produced by the LaunchDarkly SDK. These evaluations are held in memory, and in the event an error occurs, sent to Sentry for review and analysis. **At the moment, we only support boolean flag evaluations.**

_Import names: `Sentry.launchDarklyIntegration` and `Sentry.buildLaunchDarklyFlagUsedHandler`_

## Install

Install your platform's Sentry SDK and [`launchdarkly-js-client-sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/launchdarkly-js-client-sdk) from npm.

## Configure

```JavaScript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/browser';
import * as LaunchDarkly from 'launchdarkly-js-client-sdk';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [Sentry.launchDarklyIntegration()]
});

const ldClient = LaunchDarkly.initialize(
    'my-client-ID',
    {kind: 'user', key: 'my-user-context-key'},
    {inspectors: [Sentry.buildLaunchDarklyFlagUsedHandler()]}
);
```

Learn more about the [LaunchDarkly SDK](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk/client-side/javascript). At the moment, **we aren't officially supporting framework-specific LaunchDarkly SDKs.** However, you may reuse the setup code for [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/launchdarkly-react-client-sdk) and [client-side Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/launchdarkly-node-client-sdk).

## Verify

The integration is tested by evaluating a feature flag with your LaunchDarkly SDK before capturing an exception.

```JavaScript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/browser';
import * as LaunchDarkly from 'launchdarkly-js-client-sdk';

// Evaluate a flag with a default value, with the ldClient from the Configure step.
// You may have to wait for your client to initialize before doing this.
ldClient?.variation("hello", false);

Sentry.captureException(Exception("Something went wrong!"))
```

Visit the Sentry website and confirm that your error event has recorded the feature flag "hello" and its value "false".
