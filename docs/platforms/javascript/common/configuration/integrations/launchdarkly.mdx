<PlatformContent includePath="feature-flags/prerelease-alert" />

<Alert>

This integration only works inside a browser environment. It is only available from a package-based install (e.g. `npm` or `yarn`).

</Alert>

The [LaunchDarkly](https://launchdarkly.com/) integration tracks feature flag evaluations produced by the LaunchDarkly SDK. These evaluations are held in memory, and in the event an error occurs, sent to Sentry for review and analysis. **At the moment, we only support boolean flag evaluations.** This integration is available in
Sentry SDK **versions 8.43.0 or higher.**

_Import names: `Sentry.launchDarklyIntegration` and `Sentry.buildLaunchDarklyFlagUsedHandler`_

<PlatformContent includePath="/configuration/launchdarkly" />

Visit the Sentry website and confirm that your error event has recorded the feature flag "test-flag" and its value "false".
