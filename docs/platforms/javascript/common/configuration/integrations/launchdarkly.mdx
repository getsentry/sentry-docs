<Alert level="info">

This integration only works inside a browser environment.

</Alert>

The [LaunchDarkly](https://launchdarkly.com/) integration tracks feature flag evaluations produced by the LaunchDarkly SDK. These evaluations are held in memory and sent to Sentry for review and analysis if an error occurs. **At the moment, we only support boolean flag evaluations.**

_Import name: `Sentry.launchDarklyIntegration` and `Sentry.buildLaunchDarklyFlagUsedHandler`_

```JavaScript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/browser';
import * as LaunchDarkly from 'launchdarkly-js-client-sdk';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [Sentry.launchDarklyIntegration()]
});

const ldClient = LaunchDarkly.initialize(
    'my-client-ID',
    {kind: 'user', key: 'my-user-context-key'},
    {inspectors: [Sentry.buildLaunchDarklyFlagUsedHandler()]}
);
const flagVal = ldClient.variation('my-flag', false); // evaluates a flag
```

Learn more about the LaunchDarkly SDK at https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk/client-side/javascript.
At the moment, **we do not officially support framework-specific LaunchDarkly
SDKs.** However, you may reuse this setup code for React and client-side Node.js.
