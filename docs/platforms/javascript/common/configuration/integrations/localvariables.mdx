<Alert level="info">

This integration only works in the Node.js runtime.

</Alert>

_Import name: `Sentry.localVariablesIntegration`_

This integration is enabled by default. If you'd like to modify your default integrations, read [this](./../#modifying-default-integrations).

This integration captures local variables to exception frames. To enable capturing local variables via the integration, set `includeLocalVariable: true` in the SDK configuration.

```JavaScript
Sentry.init({
  includeLocalVariables: true,
});
```

The local variables integration only captures local variables from application code (`in_app = true`). Frames of a stacktrace originating from `node_modules` will not have local variables attached to them.

<Alert level="warning">

Minified local variable names attached to exception frames can't be unminified by Sentry at this time. There's an [active proposal](https://github.com/tc39/source-map/blob/main/proposals/scopes.md) for the sourcemaps spec that will add this capability.

</Alert>

## Options

### `captureAllExceptions`

_Type: `boolean`_

Defaults to `true`. If enabled, local variables are captured for both caught and uncaught exceptions.

- When false, only uncaught exceptions will have local variables
- When true, both caught and uncaught exceptions will have local variables.

Capturing local variables for all exceptions can be expensive since the debugger pauses for every throw to collect
local variables.

To reduce the likelihood of this feature impacting app performance or throughput, this feature is rate-limited.
Once the rate limit is reached, local variables will only be captured for uncaught exceptions until a timeout has
been reached.

### `maxExceptionsPerSecond`

_Type: `number`_

The maximum number of exceptions to capture local variables for per second before rate limiting is triggered.
