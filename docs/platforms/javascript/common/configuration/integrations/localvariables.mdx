_Import name: `Sentry.localVariablesIntegration`_

This integration is enabled by default. If you'd like to modify your default integrations, read [this](./../#modifying-default-integrations).

This integration captures local variables to exception frames.

## Options

### `captureAllExceptions`

_Type: `boolean`_

Defaults to `true`. If enabled, local variables are captured for both caught and uncaught exceptions.

- When false, only uncaught exceptions will have local variables
- When true, both caught and uncaught exceptions will have local variables.

Capturing local variables for all exceptions can be expensive since the debugger pauses for every throw to collect
local variables.

To reduce the likelihood of this feature impacting app performance or throughput, this feature is rate-limited.
Once the rate limit is reached, local variables will only be captured for uncaught exceptions until a timeout has
been reached.

### `maxExceptionsPerSecond`

_Type: `number`_

The maximum number of exceptions to capture local variables for per second before rate limiting is triggered.
