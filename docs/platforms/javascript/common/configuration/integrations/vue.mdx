  This integration is enabled by default (recommended) but can also be added manually.

</Alert>

_Import name: `Sentry.vueIntegration`_

This integration is enabled by default. If you'd like to modify your default integrations, read [this](./../#modifying-default-integrations).

Adds error and span instrumentation for Vue applications.

## Manual Setup

If the Vue application is not defined from the start, you can add error monitoring for Vue-specific errors later on.
To manually add the integration for late-defined Vue applications:

```javascript {filename:main.js}
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/vue';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: '...',
  // Filter out default `Vue` integration
  integrations: integrations => integrations.filter(integration => integration.name !== 'Vue'),
});

// Sometimes later
const app = createApp({
  template: '<div>hello</div>',
});

Sentry.addIntegration(Sentry.vueIntegration({ app }));
`
