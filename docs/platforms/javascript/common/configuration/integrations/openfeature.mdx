<Alert level="info">

This integration only works inside a browser environment.

</Alert>

The [OpenFeature](https://openfeature.dev/) integration tracks feature flag evaluations produced by the OpenFeature SDK. These evaluations are held in memory, and in the event an error occurs, sent to Sentry for review and analysis. **At the moment, we only support boolean flag evaluations.**

_Import name: `Sentry.openFeatureIntegration` and `Sentry.OpenFeatureIntegrationHook`_

## Install

Install your platform's Sentry SDK and [`@openfeature/web-sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openfeature/web-sdk) from npm.

## Configure

```JavaScript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/browser';
import { OpenFeature } from '@openfeature/web-sdk';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [Sentry.openFeatureIntegration()]
});

OpenFeature.setProvider(new MyProviderOfChoice());

// Option 1: track all OpenFeature evaluations.
OpenFeature.addHooks(new Sentry.OpenFeatureIntegrationHook());

// Option 2: only track evaluations by a specific client.
const client = OpenFeature.getClient();
client.addHooks(new Sentry.OpenFeatureIntegrationHook());
```

Learn more about OpenFeature [providers](https://openfeature.dev/docs/reference/concepts/provider) and the [web SDK](https://openfeature.dev/docs/reference/technologies/client/web/).

## Verify

The integration is tested by evaluating a feature flag with your OpenFeature SDK before capturing an exception.

```JavaScript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/browser';
import { OpenFeature } from '@openfeature/web-sdk';

// Evaluate a flag with a default value. If you added the hook to a client in
// the Configure step, make sure to use the same client here.
const client = OpenFeature.getClient();
const result = client.getBooleanValue('hello', false);

Sentry.captureException(new Error("Something went wrong!"))
```

Visit the Sentry website and confirm that your error event has recorded the feature flag "hello" and its value "false".
