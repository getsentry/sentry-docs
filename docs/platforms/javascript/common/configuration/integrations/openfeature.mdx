<Alert level="info">

This integration only works inside a browser environment.

</Alert>

_Import name: `Sentry.openFeatureIntegration` and `Sentry.OpenFeatureIntegrationHook`_

The [OpenFeature](https://https://openfeature.dev/) integration tracks feature flag evaluations produced by the OpenFeature SDK. These evaluations are held in memory and, in the event an error occurs, sent to Sentry for review and analysis. **At the moment, we only support boolean flag evaluations.**

```JavaScript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/browser';
import { OpenFeature } from '@openfeature/web-sdk';

Sentry.init({integrations: [Sentry.openFeatureIntegration()]});

const client = OpenFeature.getClient();
client.addHooks(new Sentry.OpenFeatureIntegrationHook());

// Evaluating flags will record the result on the Sentry client.
const result = client.getBooleanValue('my-flag', false);
```

Learn more about the OpenFeature SDK at https://github.com/open-feature/js-sdk/tree/main.
