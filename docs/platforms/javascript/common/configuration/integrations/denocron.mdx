_Import name: `Sentry.denoCronIntegration`_

[Sentry Crons](/product/crons/) allows you to monitor the uptime and performance of any scheduled, recurring job in your application.

The DenoCron integration sets up automatic monitoring for your cron jobs created by [`Deno.cron`](https://docs.deno.com/deploy/kv/manual/cron). It captures check-ins and sends them to Sentry.
