With [performance monitoring](/product/performance/), Sentry tracks your software performance, measuring metrics like throughput and latency, and displaying the impact of errors across multiple systems. Sentry captures distributed traces consisting of transactions and spans, which measure individual services and individual operations within those services.

The BrowserTracing integration sets up automatic performance monitoring for your frontend applications. It captures transactions and spans from the browser and sends them to Sentry.
