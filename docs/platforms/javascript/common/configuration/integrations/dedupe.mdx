_Import name: `Sentry.dedupeIntegration`_

This integration is enabled by default. If you'd like to modify your default integrations, read [this](./../#modifying-default-integrations).

This integration deduplicates certain events. It can be helpful if you're receiving many duplicate errors. Note, that Sentry only compares stack traces and fingerprints.
