_Import name: `Sentry.onUncaughtExceptionIntegration`_

This integration is enabled by default. If you'd like to modify your default integrations, read [this](./../#modifying-default-integrations).

The `onUncaughtExceptionIntegration` registers handlers to capture global uncaught exceptions that would cause the process to exit.

This integration _does not_ prevent the process from exiting! If you want to prevent the process from exiting, you should register your own uncaught exception handler and configure `exitEvenIfOtherHandlersAreRegistered: false` in the integration options.

## Options

### `exitEvenIfOtherHandlersAreRegistered`

_Type: `boolean`_

If set to false, the SDK will _not_ exit if we detect that another uncaught exception handler is registered.

### `ignoreIncomingRequests`

_Type: `(url: string) => boolean`_

Allows you to define a method to filter out incoming requests based on the URL. If the method returns `true`, the request will be ignored.
