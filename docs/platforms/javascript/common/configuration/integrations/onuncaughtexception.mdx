<Alert level="info">

This integration only works inside server environments (Node.js, Bun, Deno).

</Alert>

_Import name: `Sentry.onUncaughtExceptionIntegration`_

This integration is enabled by default. If you'd like to modify your default integrations, read [this](./../#modifying-default-integrations).

The `onUncaughtExceptionIntegration` registers handlers to capture global uncaught exceptions that would cause the process to exit.

This integration _does not_ prevent the process from exiting! If you want to prevent the process from exiting, you should register your own uncaught exception handler and configure `exitEvenIfOtherHandlersAreRegistered: false` in the integration options.

## Options

### `exitEvenIfOtherHandlersAreRegistered`

_Type: `boolean`_

If set to false, the SDK will _not_ exit if we detect that another uncaught exception handler is registered.

### `onFatalError`

_Type: `(firstError: Error, secondError: Error | undefined) => void`_

This method is called when an uncaught error would cause the process to exit. `secondError` will be set if the handler was called multiple times. This can happen either because `onFatalError` itself threw, or because an independent error happened somewhere else while `onFatalError` was running.
