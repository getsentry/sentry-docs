## Options

### `depth`

_Type: `number`_

Limit of how deep the object serializer should go. The default is 3. Anything deeper than the set limit will
be replaced with standard Node.js REPL notation of [Object], [Array], [Function], or
a primitive value.

### `captureErrorCause`

_Type: `boolean`_

Indicates if the serializer should catch the `cause` of the error. For more information, see the [Error: cause MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/cause).
