<Alert level="info">

This integration only works in the Node.js runtime.

</Alert>

`nodeProfilingIntegration` must be imported from the `@sentry/profiling-node` package.

[Profiling](/product/profiling/), builds upon [Sentry Performance Monitoring](/product/performance/) to provide precise code-level visibility into browser application execution in a production environment.

The NodeProfiling integration sets up automatic performance profiling for your Node.js applications. It captures profiles via v8 and sends them to Sentry. To use this integration, you also need to have the performance monitoring enabled.
