<Alert>

  This integration only works inside a browser environment.

</Alert>

_Import name: `Sentry.graphqlClientIntegration`_

This integration enhances the data captured from GraphQL requests in your application.
It extracts GraphQL-specific information from HTTP requests matching your configured endpoints and enriches
both spans and breadcrumbs with GraphQL operation details.

When enabled, this integration will:
- Update span names with the GraphQL operation type and name
- Add GraphQL query documents to spans
- Add GraphQL operation information to breadcrumbs

## Options

### `endpoints`

_Type: `(string|RegExp)[]`_

An array of URLs or URL patterns that should be treated as GraphQL endpoints.
The integration will only process requests to these endpoints. This array can contain strings, regular expressions, or a combination of both.

Example:
```javascript
Sentry.init({
  integrations: [
    Sentry.graphqlClientIntegration({
      endpoints: [
        'https://api.example.com/graphql',
        /\/graphql$/
      ]
    })
  ]
});
```

To **match all** endpoints with the `graphqlClientIntegration`, you would set the endpoints option to `[/.*/]` in your configuration.
This regex pattern will match any URL.
