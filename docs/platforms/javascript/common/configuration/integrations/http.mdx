<Alert>

This integration only works inside server environments (Node.js, Bun, Deno).

</Alert>

_Import name: `Sentry.httpIntegration`_

This integration is enabled by default. If you'd like to modify your default integrations, read [this](./../#modifying-default-integrations).

The `httpIntegration` does two things:

1. It captures breadcrumbs for HTTP requests.
2. It captures spans for outgoing HTTP requests.

```JavaScript
Sentry.init({
  integrations: [Sentry.httpIntegration()],
});
```

## Options

### `breadcrumbs`

_Type: `boolean`_

If set to false, no breadcrumbs will be captured.

### `maxIncomingRequestBodySize`

_Type: `'none' | 'small' | 'medium' | 'always'`_ (Defaults to `'medium'`)

Controls the maximum size of incoming HTTP request bodies attached to events.

Available options:
- 'none': No request bodies will be attached
- 'small': Request bodies up to 1,000 bytes will be attached
- 'medium': Request bodies up to 10,000 bytes will be attached (default)
- 'always': Request bodies will always be attached

Note that even with the `'always'` setting, bodies exceeding 1 MB will never be attached for performance and security reasons.

### `ignoreIncomingRequestBody`

_Type: `(url: string, request: RequestOptions) => boolean`_

Allows you to ignore the request body for incoming HTTP requests to URLs where the given callback returns `true`.
This can be useful for long running requests where the body is not needed and we want to avoid capturing it.

The callback function receives two arguments:

- `url`: The full URL of the incoming request, including the protocol, host, port, path and query string. For example: `https://example.com/users?name=John`.
- `request`: An object of type `RequestOptions` containing the incoming request's options. You can use this to filter on properties like the request method or headers.

### `ignoreOutgoingRequests`

_Type: `(url: string, request: RequestOptions) => boolean`_

Allows you to define a method to filter out outgoing requests based on the URL. If the method returns `true`, no spans or breadcrumbs will be captured for the outgoing request.

The callback function receives two arguments:

- `url`: The full URL of the outgoing request, including the protocol, host, port, path and query string. For example: `https://example.com/users?name=John`.
- `request`: An object of type `RequestOptions` containing the outgoing request's options. You can use this to filter on properties like the request method or headers.

### `ignoreIncomingRequests`

_Type: `(urlPath: string, request: IncomingMessage) => boolean`_

Allows you to define a method to filter out incoming requests based on the URL. If the method returns `true`, no span or transaction will be captured for the incoming request.

The callback function receives two arguments:

- `urlPath`: The URL path of the incoming request, including the query string if available. For example: `/users?name=John`.
- `request`: An object of type `IncomingMessage` containing the incoming request. You can use this to filter on properties like the request method or headers.

### `trackIncomingRequestsAsSessions`

_Type: `boolean`_ (Defaults to `true`)

Determines whether the integration should create [Sessions](/product/releases/health/#sessions) for incoming requests to track the health and crash-free rate of your releases in Sentry.
Read more about [Release Health](/product/releases/health/).

### `instrumentation`

You can also pass some hooks through to the [underlying OpenTelemetry Instrumentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@opentelemetry/instrumentation-http):

```typescript
httpIntegration({
  instrumentation?: {
    requestHook?: (span: Span, req: ClientRequest | HTTPModuleRequestIncomingMessage) => void;
    responseHook?: (span: Span, response: HTTPModuleRequestIncomingMessage | ServerResponse) => void;
    applyCustomAttributesOnSpan?: (
      span: Span,
      request: ClientRequest | HTTPModuleRequestIncomingMessage,
      response: HTTPModuleRequestIncomingMessage | ServerResponse,
    ) => void;
});
```
