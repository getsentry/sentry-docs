Sentry provides a number of integrations which are designed to add automatic instrumentation to your application. Some of these integrations are enabled by default, while others have to be explicitly enabled.

<PlatformSection supported={["javascript.nextjs"]}>

## Integration Usage In Next.js

Next.js can operate within three runtimes: the Node.js runtime, the browser runtime, and the Edge runtime.
However, it's important to note that not all integrations are compatible with all of these runtimes.

Depending on whether an integration enhances the functionality of a particular runtime, such as the BrowserTracing integration for the browser runtime or the RequestData integration for the Node.js runtime, you can only include these integrations in their respective configuration files:

- For the browser runtime, add integrations to `sentry.client.config.ts`.
- For Node.js, add integrations to `sentry.server.config.ts`.
- For the Edge runtime, add integrations to `sentry.edge.config.ts`.

</PlatformSection>

## Modifying Default Integrations

To disable system integrations, set `defaultIntegrations: false` when calling `init()`.

To override their settings, provide a new instance with your config to the `integrations` option. For example, to turn off browser capturing console calls:

<SignInNote />

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  integrations: [
    Sentry.linkedErrorsIntegration({
      limit: 7,
    }),
  ],
});
```

## Adding an Integration

You can add additional integrations in your `init` call:

<PlatformContent includePath="configuration/enable-pluggable-integrations" />

Alternatively, you can add integrations via `Sentry.addIntegration()`.
This is useful if you only want to enable an integration in a specific environment or if you want to load an integration later.
For all other cases, we recommend you use the `integrations` option.

<PlatformContent includePath="configuration/enable-pluggable-integrations-lazy" />

<PlatformCategorySection supported={['browser']}>

## Lazy Loading Integrations

You can lazy load pluggable integrations via `Sentry.lazyLoadIntegration()`. This will try to load the integration from the CDN, allowing you to add an integration without increasing the initial bundle size.

```javascript
async function loadHttpClient() {
  const httpClientIntegration = await Sentry.lazyLoadIntegration('httpClientIntegration');
  Sentry.addIntegration(httpClientIntegration());
}
```

Note that this function will reject if it fails to load the integration from the CDN, which can happen e.g. if a user has an ad-blocker or if there is a network problem. You should always make sure to handle rejections for this function in your application.

Lazy loading is available for the following integrations:

- `replayIntegration`
- `replayCanvasIntegration`
- `feedbackIntegration`
- `feedbackModalIntegration`
- `feedbackScreenshotIntegration`
- `captureConsoleIntegration`
- `contextLinesIntegration`
- `linkedErrorsIntegration`
- `debugIntegration`
- `dedupeIntegration`
- `extraErrorDataIntegration`
- `httpClientIntegration`
- `reportingObserverIntegration`
- `rewriteFramesIntegration`
- `sessionTimingIntegration`
- `browserProfilingIntegration`


</PlatformCategorySection>

## Removing a Default Integration

If you only want to remove a single or some of the default integrations, instead of disabling all of them with `defaultIntegrations: false`, you can use the following syntax to filter out the ones you don't want.

This example removes the integration for adding breadcrumbs to the event, which is enabled by default:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  // ...
  integrations: function (integrations) {
    // integrations will be all default integrations
    return integrations.filter(function (integration) {
      return integration.name !== "Breadcrumbs";
    });
  },
});
```

## Custom Integrations

You can also create [custom integrations](./custom).
