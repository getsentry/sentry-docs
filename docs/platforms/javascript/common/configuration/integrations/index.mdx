The Sentry SDK uses integrations to hook into the functionality of popular libraries to automatically instrument your application and give you the best data out of the box.

Integrations automatically add error instrumentation, performance instrumentation, and/or extra context information to your application. Some are enabled by default, but you can disable them or modify their settings.

</PlatformSection>

## Modifying Default Integrations

To disable system integrations, set `defaultIntegrations: false` when calling `init()`.

To override their settings, provide a new instance with your config to the `integrations` option. For example, to turn off browser capturing console calls:

<SignInNote />

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  integrations: [
    Sentry.linkedErrorsIntegration({
      limit: 7,
    }),
  ],
});
```

## Adding an Integration

You can add additional integrations in your `init` call:

<PlatformContent includePath="configuration/enable-pluggable-integrations" />

Alternatively, you can add integrations via `Sentry.addIntegration()`.
This is useful if you only want to enable an integration in a specific environment or if you want to load an integration later.
For all other cases, we recommend you use the `integrations` option.

<PlatformContent includePath="configuration/enable-pluggable-integrations-lazy" />

<PlatformCategorySection supported={['browser']}>

## Lazy Loading Integrations

You can lazy load pluggable integrations via `Sentry.lazyLoadIntegration()`. This will try to load the integration from the CDN, allowing you to add an integration without increasing the initial bundle size.

```javascript
async function loadHttpClient() {
  const httpClientIntegration = await Sentry.lazyLoadIntegration(
    "httpClientIntegration"
  );
  Sentry.addIntegration(httpClientIntegration());
}
```

Note that this function will reject if it fails to load the integration from the CDN, which can happen e.g. if a user has an ad-blocker or if there is a network problem. You should always make sure to handle rejections for this function in your application.

Lazy loading is available for the following integrations:

- `replayIntegration`
- `replayCanvasIntegration`
- `feedbackIntegration`
- `feedbackModalIntegration`
- `feedbackScreenshotIntegration`
- `captureConsoleIntegration`
- `contextLinesIntegration`
- `linkedErrorsIntegration`
- `debugIntegration`
- `dedupeIntegration`
- `extraErrorDataIntegration`
- `httpClientIntegration`
- `reportingObserverIntegration`
- `rewriteFramesIntegration`
- `sessionTimingIntegration`
- `browserProfilingIntegration`

</PlatformCategorySection>

## Removing a Default Integration

If you only want to remove a single or some of the default integrations, instead of disabling all of them with `defaultIntegrations: false`, you can use the following syntax to filter out the ones you don't want.

This example removes the integration for adding breadcrumbs to the event, which is enabled by default:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  // ...
  integrations: function (integrations) {
    // integrations will be all default integrations
    return integrations.filter(function (integration) {
      return integration.name !== "Breadcrumbs";
    });
  },
});
```

## Custom Integrations

You can also create [custom integrations](./custom).
