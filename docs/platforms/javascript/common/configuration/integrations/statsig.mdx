<PlatformContent includePath="feature-flags/prerelease-alert" />

<Alert level="info">

This integration only works inside a browser environment. It is only available from a package-based install (e.g. `npm` or `yarn`).

</Alert>

The [Statsig](https://www.statsig.com/) integration tracks feature flag evaluations produced by the Statsig JavaScript Client SDK. These evaluations are held in memory, and in the event an error occurs, sent to Sentry for review and analysis. **At the moment, we only support boolean flag evaluations from Statsig's `checkGate` method**. Learn more about [Statsig feature gates](https://docs.statsig.com/feature-flags/working-with/).

This integration is available in Sentry SDK **versions 9.0.0 and higher**, or **versions 8.55.0 and higher for v8.**
