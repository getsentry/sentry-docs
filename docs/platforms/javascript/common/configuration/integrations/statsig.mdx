<PlatformContent includePath="feature-flags/prerelease-alert" />

<Alert level="info">

This integration only works inside a browser environment. It is only available from a package-based install (e.g. `npm` or `yarn`).

</Alert>

The [Statsig](https://www.statsig.com/) integration tracks feature flag evaluations produced by the Statsig JavaScript Client SDK. These evaluations are held in memory and are sent to Sentry on error and transaction events. **At the moment, we only support boolean flag evaluations from Statsig's `checkGate` method**. Learn more about [Statsig feature gates](https://docs.statsig.com/feature-flags/working-with/).

This integration is available in Sentry SDK **versions 9.0.0 and higher**, or **versions 8.55.0 and higher for v8.**
