<PlatformContent includePath="feature-flags/prerelease-alert" />

<Alert level="info">

This integration only works inside a browser environment. It is only available from a package-based install (e.g. `npm` or `yarn`).

</Alert>

The [Unleash](https://www.getunleash.io/) integration tracks feature flag evaluations produced by the Unleash SDK. These evaluations are held in memory, and in the event an error occurs, sent to Sentry for review and analysis. **At the moment, we only support boolean flag evaluations.** This integration is available in Sentry SDK **versions 8.51.0 or higher.**

_Import names: `Sentry.unleashIntegration`_

Visit the Sentry website and confirm that your error event has recorded the feature flag "test-flag" and its value "false".
