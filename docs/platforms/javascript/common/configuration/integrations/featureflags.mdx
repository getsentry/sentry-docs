<Alert>

This integration only works inside a browser environment. It is only available from a package-based install (e.g. `npm` or `yarn`).

</Alert>

<Alert level ="info">

If you are using an external feature flag provider, refer to the [supported list](/platforms/javascript/feature-flags/#enable-evaluation-tracking) before setting up this integration.

</Alert>

The Feature Flags integration allows you to manually track feature flag evaluations through an API.
These evaluations are held in memory and sent to Sentry when an error occurs.
**At the moment, we only support boolean flag evaluations.** This integration is available in
Sentry SDK **versions 8.43.0 or higher.**

_Import names: `Sentry.featureFlagsIntegration` and `type Sentry.FeatureFlagsIntegration`_

<PlatformContent includePath="/configuration/featureflags" />

Visit the Sentry website and confirm that your error event has recorded the feature flag "test-flag" and its value "false".
