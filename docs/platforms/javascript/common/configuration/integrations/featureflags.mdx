If you are using an external feature flag provider in a browser environment, refer to the <PlatformLink to="/feature-flags/#enable-evaluation-tracking">supported list</PlatformLink> before setting up this integration.

</Alert>

The Feature Flags integration allows you to manually track feature flag evaluations through an API.
These evaluations are held in memory and sent to Sentry on error and transaction events.
**At the moment, we only support boolean flag evaluations.** This integration is available in
Sentry SDK **versions 8.43.0 or higher.**

_Import names: `Sentry.featureFlagsIntegration` and `type Sentry.FeatureFlagsIntegration`_

Visit the Sentry website and confirm that your error event has recorded the feature flag "test-flag" and its value "false".
