_Import name: `Sentry.zodErrorsIntegration`_

The Zod Errors integration enhances error reporting for applications using [Zod](https://zod.dev/) schema validation.
When Zod validation fails, this integration captures detailed validation errors (`ZodError` instances) and attaches them
as additional data to Sentry events.

The Zod Errors integration is not enabled by default. You need to add it to your Sentry configuration:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  integrations: [
    Sentry.zodErrorsIntegration(),
  ],
});
```

## Options

The `zodErrorsIntegration` accepts the following options:

### `limit`

_Type: `number`_
_Default: `10`_

Limits the number of Zod errors inlined in each Sentry event.

### `saveZodIssuesAsAttachment`

_Type: `boolean`_
_Default: `false`_

Save full list of Zod issues as a JSON attachment in Sentry.

## Example Additional Error Data

When a Zod validation error occurs, you'll see enhanced error information in Sentry like this:

```json
[
  {
    "code": "too_small",
    "path": ["name"],
    "message": "Name is required",
    "minimum": 1,
    "type": "string",
    "inclusive": true,
    "received": ""
  },
  {
    "code": "invalid_string",
    "path": ["email"],
    "message": "Invalid email format",
    "validation": "email",
    "received": "invalid-email"
  }
]
```
