_Import name: `Sentry.linkedErrorsIntegration`_

This integration is enabled by default. If you'd like to modify your default integrations, read [this](./../#modifying-default-integrations).

This integration allows you to configure linked errors. They'll be recursively read up to a specified limit, then lookup will be performed by a specific key. By default, the Sentry SDK sets the limit to five and the key used is `"cause"`.

## Options

### `key`

_Type: `string`_

### `limit`

_Type: `number`_

## Example

Here's a code example of how this could be implemented:

<PlatformContent includePath="configuration/linked-errors" />
