In addition to the integrations that come with the SDK, you can also write custom integrations.

Custom integration must conform to the [Integration interface](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/master/packages/types/src/integration.ts).

A custom integration can be created and added to the SDK as follows:

```javascript
function myAwesomeIntegration() {
  return {
    name: "MyAwesomeIntegration",
    setup(client) {
      // Do something when the SDK is initialized
      // The client that is being setup is passed to the hook
    },
  };
}

Sentry.init({
  // ...
  integrations: [myAwesomeIntegration()],
});
```

All hooks on an integration are optional. The only required field is the `name`. You can use one or multiple of the following hooks in a custom integration:

### `setup`

The `setup` hook is called when the SDK is initialized. It receives the client instance as an argument.
You should use this if you want to run some code on initialization.

```javascript
const integration = {
  name: "MyAwesomeIntegration",
  setup(client) {
    setupCustomSentryListener(client);
  },
};
```

### `processEvent`

This hooks can be used to modify events before they are sent to Sentry. It receives the event as an argument and should return the modified event. The hook also receives a hint object that may hold additional event metadata, and the client that is sending the event. You can also return `null` to drop the event from being sent.

```javascript
const integration = {
  name: "MyAwesomeIntegration",
  processEvent(event, hint, client) {
    event.extra = {
      ...event.extra,
      myCustomTag: "value",
    };
    // Return the modified event,
    // or return `null` to drop the event
    return event;
  },
};
```

### `setupOnce`

This hook is similar to `setup`, but it is only run once, even if the SDK is re-initialized. It does not receive any arguments.
You should probably not use this, but use `setup` instead. The only reason to use `setupOnce` is e.g. when you may be calling `Sentry.init()` multiple times and you want to ensure a certain piece of code is only run once.
