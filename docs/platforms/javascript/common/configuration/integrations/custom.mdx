In addition to the integrations that come with the SDK, you can also write custom integrations.

Custom integration must conform to the [Integration interface](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/master/packages/types/src/integration.ts).

A custom integration can be created and added to the SDK as follows:

```javascript
function myAwesomeIntegration() {
  return {
    name: "MyAwesomeIntegration",
    setupOnce() {
      // Do something when the SDK is initialized
    },
  };
}

Sentry.init({
  // ...
  integrations: [myAwesomeIntegration()],
});
```

The JavaScript Core Package (`@sentry/core`) also exports a helper function called `defineIntegration` to help with type-safety:

```typescript
import { defineIntegration } from "@sentry/core";

const myAwesomeIntegration = defineIntegration(() => {
  return {
    name: "MyAwesomeIntegration",
    setupOnce() {
      // Do something when the SDK is initialized
    },
  };
});

Sentry.init({
  // ...
  integrations: [myAwesomeIntegration()],
});
```
