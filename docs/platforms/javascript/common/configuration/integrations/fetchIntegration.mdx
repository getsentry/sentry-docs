<Alert>

This integration only works inside the Cloudflare Workers runtime.

</Alert>

_Import name: `Sentry.fetchIntegration`_

This integration is enabled by default. If you want to disable it, you can [modify your default integrations](./../#modifying-default-integrations).

The `fetchIntegration` creates spans and attaches tracing headers to fetch requests in Cloudflare Workers.

```JavaScript
Sentry.init({
  integrations: [Sentry.fetchIntegration()],
});
```

## Options

### `breadcrumbs`

_Type: `boolean`_

If set to false, no breadcrumbs will be captured.

### `shouldCreateSpanForRequest`

_Type: `(url: string) => boolean`_

Allows you to define a method to determine whether or not to create spans to track outgoing requests to the given URL. By default, spans will be created for all outgoing requests.

```JavaScript
Sentry.init({
  integrations: [
    Sentry.fetchIntegration({
      shouldCreateSpanForRequest: (url) => {
        // Only create spans for external API calls
        return url.includes('api.example.com');
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

## Usage

The fetch integration automatically instruments all `fetch()` calls made within your Cloudflare Worker. This includes:

- Creating performance spans for outgoing HTTP requests
- Adding tracing headers to continue distributed traces
- Capturing breadcrumbs for debugging purposes
- Tracking request duration and response status

The integration works with both the standard `fetch()` API and any libraries that use fetch under the hood.

**Note:** If you need to disable fetch instrumentation for specific requests, use the `shouldCreateSpanForRequest` option to filter out unwanted requests.
