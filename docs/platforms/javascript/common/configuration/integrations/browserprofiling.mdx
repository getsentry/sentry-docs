This integration only works inside a browser environment.

_Import name: `Sentry.browserProfilingIntegration`_

[Profiling](/product/explore/profiling/) offers a deeper level of visibility on top of traditional tracing, removing the need for custom instrumentation and enabling precise code-level visibility into your application in a production environment.

The BrowserProfiling integration sets up automatic performance profiling for your frontend applications. It captures profiles via the [JS Self-Profiling API](https://wicg.github.io/js-self-profiling/) from the browser and sends them to Sentry. To use this integration, you also need to have the [BrowserTracing integration](./browsertracing) enabled.
