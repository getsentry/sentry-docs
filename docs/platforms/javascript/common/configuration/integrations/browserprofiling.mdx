This integration only works inside a browser environment.

</Alert>

_Import name: `Sentry.browserProfilingIntegration`_

[Profiling](/product/profiling/), builds upon [Sentry Performance Monitoring](/product/performance/) to provide precise code-level visibility into browser application execution in a production environment.

The BrowserProfiling integration sets up automatic performance profiling for your frontend applications. It captures profiles via the [JS Self-Profiling API](https://wicg.github.io/js-self-profiling/) from the browser and sends them to Sentry. To use this integration, you also need to have the [BrowserTracing integration](./browsertracing) enabled.
