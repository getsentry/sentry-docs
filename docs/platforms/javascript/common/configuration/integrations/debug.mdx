<Alert title="Deprecation Notice">

The `Debug` Integration is deprecated and will be removed in the next major version of the SDK.
To log outgoing events, we recommend using <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#hooks">Hook Options</PlatformLink> in `Sentry.init()`.

</Alert>

_Import name: `Sentry.debugIntegration`_

This integration allows you to inspect the contents of a processed event and hint object that gets passed to `beforeSend` or `beforeSendTransaction`. It will always run as the last integration, no matter when it was registered.

Note that this is different than setting `debug: true` (which will enable debug logging in the console) in your Sentry.init options.

<PlatformContent includePath="configuration/debug" />

## Options

### `debugger`

_Type: `boolean`_

Trigger DevTools debugger instead of using `console.log`.

### `stringify`

_Type: `boolean`_

Stringify event before passing it to `console.log`.
