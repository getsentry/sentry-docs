SDKs are configurable using a variety of options. The options are largely standardized among SDKs, but there are some differences to better accommodate platform peculiarities. Options are set when the SDK is first
initialized.

<PlatformContent includePath="configuration/config-intro" />

## Common Options

The list of common options across SDKs. These work more or less the same in all SDKs, but some subtle differences will exist to better support the platform. Options that can be read from an environment variable (`SENTRY_DSN`, `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT`, `SENTRY_RELEASE`) are read automatically.

<Note>

If you are using a framework or runtime that requires a prefix to expose environment variables to the client, you must set these options in the `init()` function. These options will not be read into the client side automatically.
This applies to `NEXT_PUBLIC_` in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables) and `VITE_` in [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html#env-files), among others.

</Note>

<ConfigKey name="dsn">

The _DSN_ tells the SDK where to send the events. If this value is not provided, the SDK will try to read it from the `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable. If that variable also does not exist, the SDK will just not send any events.

In runtimes without a process environment (such as the browser) that fallback does not apply.

Learn more about [DSN utilization](/product/sentry-basics/dsn-explainer/#dsn-utilization).

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="debug">

Turns debug mode on or off. If debug is enabled SDK will attempt to print out useful debugging information if something goes wrong with sending the event. The default is always `false`. It's generally not recommended to turn it on in production, though turning `debug` mode on will not cause any safety concerns.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="release">

Sets the release. Some SDKs will try to automatically configure a release out of the box but it's a better idea to manually set it to guarantee that the release is in sync with your deploy integrations or source map uploads. Release names are strings, but some formats are detected by Sentry and might be rendered differently. Learn more about how to send release data so Sentry can tell you about regressions between releases and identify the potential source in [the releases documentation](/product/releases/) or the <SandboxLink scenario="releases">sandbox</SandboxLink>.

<PlatformCategorySection supported={['server', 'serverless']}>
By default the SDK will try to read this value from the `SENTRY_RELEASE` environment variable.
</PlatformCategorySection>

<PlatformCategorySection supported={['browser']}>
By default the SDK will try to read this value from `window.SENTRY_RELEASE.id` if available.
</PlatformCategorySection>

<PlatformSection supported={["javascript.electron"]}>

By default the SDK will read properties from the Electron `app` module to create the release in the format `appName@version`.

</PlatformSection>

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="environment" notSupported={["javascript.electron"]}>

Sets the environment. This string is freeform and not set by default. A release can be associated with more than one environment to separate them in the UI (think `staging` vs `prod` or similar).

By default the SDK will try to read this value from the `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable (except for the browser SDK where this is not applicable).

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="environment" supported={["javascript.electron"]}>

Sets the environment. Defaults to `development` or `production` depending on whether the application is packaged.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="tunnel">

Sets the URL that will be used to transport captured events. This can be used to work around ad-blockers or to have more granular control over events sent to Sentry. Adding your DSN is still required when using this option so necessary attributes can be set on the generated Sentry data. This option **requires the implementation** of a custom server endpoint. Learn more and find examples in [Dealing with Ad-Blockers](/platforms/javascript/troubleshooting/#dealing-with-ad-blockers).

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="sample-rate">

Configures the sample rate for error events, in the range of `0.0` to `1.0`. The default is `1.0`, which means that 100% of error events will be sent. If set to `0.1`, only 10% of error events will be sent. Events are picked randomly.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="max-breadcrumbs">

This variable controls the total amount of breadcrumbs that should be captured. This defaults to `100`, but you can set this to any number. However, you should be aware that Sentry has a [maximum payload size](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/data-model/envelopes/#size-limits) and any events exceeding that payload size will be dropped.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="attach-stacktrace">

When enabled, stack traces are automatically attached to all messages logged. Stack traces are always attached to exceptions; however, when this option is set, stack traces are also sent with messages. This option, for instance, means that stack traces appear next to all log messages.

This option is turned off by default.

Grouping in Sentry is different for events with stack traces and without. As a result, you will get new groups as you enable or disable this flag for certain events.

</ConfigKey>

<PlatformCategorySection supported={['server', 'serverless']}>
<ConfigKey name="server-name">

  This option can be used to supply a "server name." When provided, the name of the server is sent along and persisted in the event. For many integrations, the server name actually corresponds to the device hostname, even in situations where the machine is not actually a server.

  Most SDKs will attempt to auto-discover this value.
</ConfigKey>

</PlatformCategorySection>

<ConfigKey name="ignore-errors">

<Include name="platforms/configuration/options/ignore-errors.mdx" />

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="ignore-transactions">

<Include name="platforms/configuration/options/ignore-transactions.mdx" />

</ConfigKey>

<PlatformCategorySection supported={['browser']}>

<ConfigKey name="deny-urls">

<Include name="platforms/configuration/options/deny-urls.mdx" />

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="allow-urls">

<Include name="platforms/configuration/options/allow-urls.mdx" />

</ConfigKey>

</PlatformCategorySection>

<ConfigKey name="auto-session-tracking" notSupported={["javascript.electron"]}>

When set to `true`, the SDK will send session events to Sentry. This is supported in all browser SDKs, emitting one session per pageload and page navigation to Sentry. In mobile SDKs, when the app goes to the background for longer than 30 seconds, sessions are ended.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="auto-session-tracking" supported={["javascript.electron"]} >

When not set to `false`, the SDK tracks sessions linked to the lifetime of the Electron main process.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="initial-scope">

Data to be set to the initial scope. Initial scope can be defined either as an object or a callback function, as shown below.

Object:


```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  debug: true,
  initialScope: {
    tags: { "my-tag": "my value" },
    user: { id: 42, email: "john.doe@example.com" },
  },
});
```

Callback function:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  debug: true,
  initialScope: (scope) => {
    scope.setTags({ a: "b" });
    return scope;
  },
});
```

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="max-value-length">

Maximum number of characters a single value can have before it will be truncated (defaults to `250`).

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="normalize-depth">

Sentry SDKs normalize any contextual data to a given depth. Any data beyond this depth will be trimmed and marked using its type instead (`[Object]` or `[Array]`), without walking the tree any further. By default, walking is performed three levels deep.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="normalize-max-breadth" notSupported={["javascript.electron"]}>

This is the maximum number of properties or entries that will be included in any given object or array when the SDK is normalizing contextual data. Any data beyond this depth will be dropped. (defaults to 1000)

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="ipcMode" supported={["javascript.electron"]}>

Inter-process communication mode to receive event and scope updates from renderer processes.

Available options are:

- `IPCMode.Classic` - Configures Electron IPC modules
- `IPCMode.Protocol` - Configures a custom protocol and `fetch`
- `IPCMode.Both` (default) - Configures both modes for maximum compatibility

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="getSessions" supported={["javascript.electron"]}>

A function that returns an array of Electron `session` objects. These sessions are used to configure communication between the Electron main and renderer processes.

Defaults to `() => [session.defaultSession]`

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="getRendererName" supported={["javascript.electron"]}>

Callback function that allows custom naming of renderer processes.

`(contents: WebContents) => string | undefined`

If the callback is not set, or it returns `undefined`, the default naming scheme is used.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="enabled">

Specifies whether this SDK should send events to Sentry. Defaults to `true`. Setting this to `enabled: false` doesn't prevent all overhead from Sentry instrumentation. To disable Sentry completely, depending on environment, call `Sentry.init` conditionally.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="send-client-reports">

Set this boolean to `false` to disable sending of client reports. Client reports are a protocol feature that let clients send status reports about themselves to Sentry. They are currently mainly used to emit outcomes for events that were never sent.

</ConfigKey>

<PlatformCategorySection supported={['server', 'serverless']}>
<ConfigKey name="include-local-variables">

Set this boolean to `true` to add stack local variables to stack traces.

<Alert level="warning">

Due to an [open Node.js issue](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/38439), we are currently unable to capture local variables for unhandled errors when using
JavaScript modules (ESM).

See the <PlatformLink to="/configuration/integrations/localvariables">integration options</PlatformLink> for a workaround.

</Alert>

</ConfigKey>
</PlatformCategorySection>

## Integration Configuration

For many platform SDKs integrations can be configured alongside it. On some platforms that happen as part of the `init()` call, in some others, different patterns apply.

<ConfigKey name="integrations">

In some SDKs, the integrations are configured through this parameter on library initialization. For more information, please see our documentation for a specific integration.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="default-integrations">

This can be used to disable integrations that are added by default. When set to `false`, no default integrations are added.

</ConfigKey>

## Hooks

These options can be used to hook the SDK in various ways to customize the reporting of events.

<ConfigKey name="before-send">

This function is called with an SDK-specific message or error event object, and can return a modified event object, or `null` to skip reporting the event. This can be used, for instance, for manual PII stripping before sending.

By the time <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send" /> is executed, all scope data has already been applied to the event. Further modification of the scope won't have any effect.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="before-send-transaction">

This function is called with an SDK-specific transaction event object, and can return a modified transaction event object, or `null` to skip reporting the event. One way this might be used is for manual PII stripping before sending.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="before-send-span">

This function is called with a serialized span object, and can return a modified span object, or `null` to skip sending the span. This might be useful for manually stripping PII from spans or to remove individual spans from the span tree.
This function is only called for child spans of the root span. If you want to modify or drop the root span, including all of its child spans, use [`beforeSendTransaction`](#before-send-transaction) instead.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="before-breadcrumb">

This function is called with an SDK-specific breadcrumb object before the breadcrumb is added to the scope. When nothing is returned from the function, the breadcrumb is dropped. To pass the breadcrumb through, return the first argument, which contains the breadcrumb object.
The callback typically gets a second argument (called a "hint") which contains the original object from which the breadcrumb was created to further customize what the breadcrumb should look like.

</ConfigKey>

## Transport Options

Transports are used to send events to Sentry. Transports can be customized to some degree to better support highly specific deployments.

<ConfigKey name="transport">

Switches out the transport used to send events. How this works depends on the SDK. It can, for instance, be used to capture events for unit-testing or to send it through some more complex setup that requires proxy authentication.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="transport-options">

Options used to configure the transport. This is an object with the following possible optional keys:

<PlatformCategorySection supported={['server', 'serverless']}>
- `headers`: An object containing headers to be sent with every request.
- `proxy`: A proxy used for outbound requests. Can be http or https.
- `caCerts`: A path or list of paths to a CA certificate, or a buffer of CA certificates.
- `httpModule`: A custom HTTP module to use for requests. Defaults to the the native `http` and `https` modules.
- `keepAlive`: Determines whether to keep the socket alive between requests. Defaults to `false`.
</PlatformCategorySection>

<PlatformCategorySection supported={['browser', 'desktop']}>
- `headers`: An object containing headers to be sent with every request. Used by the SDK's fetch and XHR transports.
- `fetchOptions`: An object containing options to be passed to the `fetch` call. Used by the SDK's fetch transport.
</PlatformCategorySection>

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="shutdown-timeout" supported={["javascript.capacitor", "javascript.node", "javascript.aws-lambda", "javascript.azure-functions", "javascript.connect", "javascript.express", "javascript.gcp-functions", "javascript.hapi", "javascript.koa", "javascript.fastify", "javascript.nestjs"]}>

Controls how many seconds to wait before shutting down. Sentry SDKs send events from a background queue. This queue is given a certain amount to drain pending events. The default is SDK specific but typically around two seconds. Setting this value too low may cause problems for sending events from command line applications. Setting the value too high will cause the application to block for a long time for users experiencing network connectivity problems.

</ConfigKey>

## Tracing Options

<ConfigKey name="enable-tracing">

A boolean value, if true, transactions and trace data will be generated and captured. This will set the `traces-sample-rate` to the recommended default of 1.0 if `traces-sample-rate` is not defined. Note that `traces-sample-rate` and `traces-sampler` take precedence over this option.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="traces-sample-rate">

A number between 0 and 1, controlling the percentage chance a given transaction will be sent to Sentry. (0 represents 0% while 1 represents 100%.) Applies equally to all transactions created in the app. Either this or <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> must be defined to enable tracing.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="traces-sampler">

A function responsible for determining the percentage chance a given transaction will be sent to Sentry. It will automatically be passed information about the transaction and the context in which it's being created, and must return a number between `0` (0% chance of being sent) and `1` (100% chance of being sent). Can also be used for filtering transactions, by returning 0 for those that are unwanted. Either this or <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> must be defined to enable tracing.

</ConfigKey>

<PlatformCategorySection supported={['server', 'serverless']}>
<ConfigKey name="trace-propagation-targets">

An optional property that controls which downstream services receive tracing data, in the form of a `sentry-trace` and a `baggage` header attached to any outgoing HTTP requests.

The option may contain a list of strings or regex against which the URLs of outgoing requests are matched.
If one of the entries in the list matches the URL of an outgoing request, trace data will be attached to that request.
String entries do not have to be full matches, meaning the URL of a request is matched when it _contains_ a string provided through the option.

If <PlatformIdentifier name="trace-propagation-targets" /> is not provided, trace data is attached to every outgoing request from the instrumented client.

</ConfigKey>
</PlatformCategorySection>

<PlatformSection supported={["javascript.cordova", "javascript.capacitor"]}>

## Experimental Features

<ConfigKey name="experimental">

An optional property that configures which features are in experimental mode. This property is either an `Object Type` with properties or a key/value `TypedDict`, depending the language. Experimental features are still in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.

</ConfigKey>

## Hybrid SDK Options

<ConfigKey name="enableNative">

Set this boolean to `false` to disable the native SDK. This will disable all native crash and error handling and, instead, the SDK will only capture errors on the upper layer.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="autoInitializeNativeSdk">

Set this boolean to `false` to disable the auto initialization of the native layer SDK. Doing so means you will need to initialize the native SDK manually. Do not use this to disable the native layer.

To disable the native layer, use [enableNative](#enableNative).

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="enableNativeCrashHandling" supported={["javascript.capacitor"]}>

Set this boolean to `false` to disable hard crash handling from the native layer. Doing so means that the SDK won't capture events for hard crashes on Android and iOS if the error was caused by native code.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="enableNativeNagger" supported={["javascript.capacitor"]}>

Set this boolean to `false` to disable the native nagger alert being shown.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="enableAutoSessionTracking">

Set this boolean to `false` to disable the [release health](/product/releases/health/) feature.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="sessionTrackingIntervalMillis">

Set this to change the default interval to end a session (release health) if the app goes to the background. Default is 30,000.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="enableNdkScopeSync">

Set this boolean to `false` to disable the scope sync from Java to NDK on Android.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="attachThreads">

Set this boolean to `true` to automatically attach all threads to all logged events on Android.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="enableOutOfMemoryTracking" supported={["javascript.capacitor"]}>

Set this boolean to `false` to disable [out of memory](/platforms/apple/guides/ios/configuration/out-of-memory/) tracking on iOS.

</ConfigKey>

</PlatformSection>
