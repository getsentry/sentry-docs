When you add Sentry to your app, you get a lot of valuable information about errors and performance. And lots of information is good -- as long as it's the right information, at a reasonable volume.

Sentry offers [Inbound Filters](/concepts/data-management/filtering/) that you can enable per project to filter out various events in sentry.io. You can use our pre-defined inbound filters (e.g. filtering known browser extensions), as well as add your own message-based filters.

However, we recommend filtering at the client-level, because it removes the overhead of sending events you don't actually want. The Sentry SDKs have several configuration options, which are described in this document, to help you filter out events. To learn more about the event fields you can use for filtering, see [Event Payloads](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/event-payloads/).

## Filtering Error Events

Configure your SDK to filter error events by using the <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send" /> callback method and configuring, enabling, or disabling integrations.

### Using <PlatformIdentifier name="ignore-errors" />

You can use the <PlatformIdentifier name="ignore-errors" /> option to filter out errors that match a certain pattern. This option receives a list of strings and regular expressions to match against the error message. When using strings, partial matches will be filtered out. If you need to filter by exact match, use regex patterns instead.

<PlatformContent includePath="configuration/ignore-errors" />

### Using <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send" />

You can configure a <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send" /> callback method to filter error events. Because it's called immediately before the event is sent to the server, this is your last chance to decide not to send data or to edit it. <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send" /> receives the event object as a parameter and, based on custom logic and the data available on the event, you can either modify the event’s data or drop it completely by returning `null`.

<PlatformContent includePath="configuration/before-send/" />

Note also that breadcrumbs can be filtered, as discussed in [our Breadcrumbs documentation](/product/error-monitoring/breadcrumbs/).

#### Event Hints

The <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send" /> callback is passed both the `event` and a second argument, `hint`, that holds one or more hints.

Typically, a `hint` holds the original exception so that additional data can be extracted or grouping is affected. In this example, the fingerprint is forced to a common value if an exception of a certain type has been caught:

<PlatformContent includePath="configuration/before-send-hint" />

When the SDK creates an event or breadcrumb for transmission, that transmission is typically created from some sort of source object. For instance, an error event is typically created from a log record or exception instance. For better customization, SDKs send these objects to certain callbacks (<PlatformIdentifier name="before-send" />, <PlatformIdentifier name="before-breadcrumb" /> or the event processor system in the SDK).

### Using Hints

Hints are available in two places:

1. <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send" /> / <PlatformIdentifier name="before-breadcrumb" />
2. `eventProcessors`

Event and breadcrumb `hints` are objects containing various information used to put together an event or a breadcrumb. Typically `hints` hold the original exception so that additional data can be extracted or grouping can be affected.

For events, hints contain properties such as `event_id`, `originalException`, `syntheticException` (used internally to generate cleaner stack trace), and any other arbitrary `data` that you attach.

For breadcrumbs, the use of `hints` is implementation dependent. For XHR requests, the hint contains the xhr object itself; for user interactions the hint contains the DOM element and event name and so forth.

<PlatformContent includePath="configuration/before-send-fingerprint">

In this example, the fingerprint is forced to a common value if an exception of a certain type has been caught:

</PlatformContent>

#### Hints for Events

`originalException`

The original exception that caused the Sentry SDK to create the event. This is useful for changing how the Sentry SDK groups events or to extract additional information.

`syntheticException`

When a string or a non-error object is raised, Sentry creates a synthetic exception so you can get a basic stack trace. This exception is stored here for further data extraction.

#### Hints for Breadcrumbs

<PlatformContent includePath="configuration/breadcrumb-hints" />

### Using `allowUrls` and `denyUrls`

You can construct an allowed list of domains which may raise exceptions that should be sent to Sentry. For example, if your scripts are loaded from `cdn.example.com` and your site is `example.com`, you can set `allowUrls` to:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  allowUrls: [/https?:\/\/((cdn|www)\.)?example\.com/],
});
```

You can also use `denyUrls` if you want to block specific URLs from sending exceptions to Sentry.

### Using `thirdPartyErrorFilterIntegration`

_Available in browser-based SDKs from version 8.10.0_

The `thirdPartyErrorFilterIntegration` allows you to filter out errors originating from third parties, such as browser extensions, code-injecting browsers, or widgets from third-party services that also use Sentry.
This integration can be very helpful in reducing noise that's not related to your own application code.

<Note>

**Prerequisite**: To use the `thirdPartyErrorFilterIntegration`, ensure you are using a bundler and one of [Sentry's bundler plugins](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript-bundler-plugins).

</Note>

This integration works by "marking" your JavaScript files with an "application key" during the build process.
At runtime, if an error occurs, the integration checks application keys for each stack frame in the stack trace.
This allows you to filter out errors with "unmarked" stack frames, which would indicate third-party code.

To set up the integration, first pass an `applicationKey` to your Sentry bundler plugin. This can be an arbitrary string that identifies your application code:

```ts {tabTitle:Vite} {8}
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import { sentryVitePlugin } from "@sentry/vite-plugin";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    sentryVitePlugin({
      applicationKey: "your-custom-application-key",
    }),
  ],
});
```

```js {tabTitle:Webpack} {7}
// webpack.config.js
const { sentryWebpackPlugin } = require("@sentry/webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    sentryWebpackPlugin({
      applicationKey: "your-custom-application-key",
    }),
  ],
};
```

```js {tabTitle:esbuild} {7}
// esbuild.config.js
const { sentryEsbuildPlugin } = require("@sentry/esbuild-plugin");

require("esbuild").build({
  plugins: [
    sentryEsbuildPlugin({
      applicationKey: "your-custom-application-key",
    }),
  ],
});
```

```js {tabTitle:Rollup} {7}
// rollup.config.mjs
import { sentryRollupPlugin } from "@sentry/rollup-plugin";

export default {
  plugins: [
    sentryRollupPlugin({
      applicationKey: "your-custom-application-key",
    }),
  ],
};
```

Next, add the `thirdPartyErrorFilterIntegration` to your Sentry initialization:

```js {3-14}
Sentry.init({
  integrations: [
    Sentry.thirdPartyErrorFilterIntegration({
      // Specify the application keys that you specified in the Sentry bundler plugin
      filterKeys: ["your-custom-application-key"],

      // Defines how to handle errors that contain third party stack frames.
      // Possible values are:
      // - 'drop-error-if-contains-third-party-frames'
      // - 'drop-error-if-exclusively-contains-third-party-frames'
      // - 'apply-tag-if-contains-third-party-frames'
      // - 'apply-tag-if-exclusively-contains-third-party-frames'
      behaviour: "drop-error-if-contains-third-party-frames",
    }),
  ],
});
```

The `filterKeys` option takes an array of strings that should be equal to the `applicationKey` value set in the bundler plugin options.
Unless your website hosts files from more than one of your build-processes, the array should only contain one item.

The `behaviour` option defines what should happen with errors that contain stack frames from third-party code.
There are four modes you can choose from:

- `"drop-error-if-contains-third-party-frames"`: Drop error events that contain at least one third-party stack frame.
- `"drop-error-if-exclusively-contains-third-party-frames"`: Drop error events that exclusively contain third-party stack frames.
- `"apply-tag-if-contains-third-party-frames"`: Keep all error events, but apply a `third_party_code: true` tag in case the error contains at least one third-party stack frame.
- `"apply-tag-if-exclusively-contains-third-party-frames"`: Keep all error events, but apply a `third_party_code: true` tag in case the error contains exclusively third-party stack frames.

If you choise a mode to only apply tags, the tags can then be used in Sentry to filter your issue stream with the `third_party_code` tag in the issue search bar.

## Filtering Transaction Events

To prevent certain transactions from being reported to Sentry, use the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> or <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send-transaction" /> configuration option, which allows you to provide a function to evaluate the current transaction and drop it if it's not one you want.

### Using <PlatformIdentifier name="ignore-transactions" />

You can use the <PlatformIdentifier name="ignore-transactions" /> option to filter out transactions that match a certain pattern. This option receives a list of strings and regular expressions to match against the transaction name. When using strings, partial matches will be filtered out. If you need to filter by exact match, use regex patterns instead.

<PlatformContent includePath="configuration/ignore-transactions" />

### Using <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" />

**Note:** The <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> and <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> config options are mutually exclusive. If you define a <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> to filter out certain transactions, you must also handle the case of non-filtered transactions by returning the rate at which you'd like them sampled.

In its simplest form, used just for filtering the transaction, it looks like this:

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/traces-sampler-as-filter" />

It also allows you to sample different transactions at different rates.

If the transaction currently being processed has a parent transaction (from an upstream service calling this service), the parent (upstream) sampling decision will always be included in the sampling context data, so that your <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> can choose whether and when to inherit that decision. In most cases, inheritance is the right choice, to avoid breaking distributed traces. A broken trace will not include all your services. See <PlatformLink to="/configuration/sampling/#inheritance">Inheriting the parent sampling decision</PlatformLink> to learn more.

### Using <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send-transaction" />

<PlatformContent includePath="configuration/before-send-transaction" />

## Filtering Spans

To prevent certain spans from being reported to Sentry, use the <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send-span" /> configuration option, which allows you to provide a function to evaluate the current span and drop it if it's not one you want.

<PlatformContent includePath="configuration/before-send-span" />
