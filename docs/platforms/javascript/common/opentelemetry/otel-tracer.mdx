title: Using an OpenTelemetry Tracer

We recommend using `Sentry.startSpan()` and related APIs to create spans. However, you can also use native OpenTelemetry APIs to create spans.

You can access the tracer Sentry uses via `client.tracer` and then create spans with OpenTelemetry APIs, as shown below:

```javascript
const Sentry = require("@sentry/node");

const tracer = Sentry.getClient()?.tracer;
// Now you can use native APIs on the tracer:
tracer.startActiveSpan("span name", () => {
  // measure something
});
```

You can also use any other tracer; all OpenTelemetry spans will be picked up by Sentry automatically.
