Sentry supports OpenTelemetry APIs out of the box. Any spans started using OpenTelemetry APIs will be automatically captured by Sentry, while any spans started using the Sentry SDK will be automatically propagated to OpenTelemetry.

## Adding Additional OpenTelemetry Instrumentation

While the Sentry SDK includes some OpenTelemetry instrumentation out of the box, you may want to add additional instrumentation to your application. This can be done by registering the instrumentation through OpenTelemetry like the example below:

```javascript
const Sentry = require("@sentry/node");
const {
  GenericPoolInstrumentation,
} = require("@opentelemetry/instrumentation-generic-pool");

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___DSN___",

  // The SentrySampler will use this to determine which traces to sample
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

// Afterwards, you can add additional instrumentation:
Sentry.addOpenTelemetryInstrumentation(new GenericPoolInstrumentation());
```

Any instrumentation added like this or via `registerInstrumentations()` from `@opentelemetry/instrumentation` will be picked up by Sentry.

## Using an OpenTelemetry Tracer

We recommend using `Sentry.startSpan()` and related APIs to create spans, but you can also create spans using native OpenTelemetry APIs.

You can access the tracer Sentry uses via `client.tracer` and then create spans with OpenTelemetry APIs, as shown below:

```javascript
const Sentry = require("@sentry/node");

const tracer = Sentry.getClient()?.tracer;
// Now you can use native APIs on the tracer:
tracer.startActiveSpan("span name", () => {
  // measure something
});
```

You can also use any other tracer. All OpenTelemetry spans will be picked up by Sentry automatically.

## Modifying the default OpenTelemetry TracerProvider

You can access the tracer provider set up by Sentry when using Sentry's default OpenTelemetry instrumentation. This enables you to easily add additional span processors, allowing you to export tracing data to various OTEL collectors or other backends.

```javascript
const Sentry = require("@sentry/node");

const provider = Sentry.getClient()?.traceProvider;
provider?.addSpanProcessor(new MySpanProcessor());
```
