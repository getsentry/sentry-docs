When using the default OpenTelemetry setup from Sentry, you can access the tracer provider that Sentry set up for you. This makes it easy to for example add additional span processors, if you want to send span data to another backend, or similar.

```javascript
const Sentry = require("@sentry/node");

const provider = Sentry.getClient()?.traceProvider;
provider?.addSpanProcessor(new MySpanProcessor());
```
