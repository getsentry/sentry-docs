title: Using a Custom OpenTelemetry Sampler
description: "Using a custom sampler with OpenTelemetry & Sentry"

We recommend using `SentrySampler` as this will ensure the correct subset of traces is sent to Sentry depending on your `tracesSampleRate`, as well as that all other Sentry features like trace propagation work as expected.
If you however need to use your own sampler then make sure to wrap your `SamplingResult` with our `wrapSamplingDecision` method:

```javascript
const { NodeTracerProvider } = require("@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node");
const Sentry = require("@sentry/node");
const {
  SentrySpanProcessor,
  SentryPropagator,
  SentrySampler,
  wrapSamplingDecision
} = require("@sentry/opentelemetry");

// implements Sampler from "@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node"
class CustomSampler {
  shouldSample(context, _traceId, _spanName, _spanKind, attributes, _links) {
    const decision = yourDecisionLogic();

    // wrap the result
    return wrapSamplingDecision({
      decision,
      context,
      spanAttributes: attributes,
    });
  }

  toString() {
    return CustomSampler.name;
  }
}

const sentryClient = Sentry.init({
  dsn: "__DSN__",
  skipOpenTelemetrySetup: true,

  // By defining any sample rate,
  // tracing intergations will be added by default
  // omit this if you do not want any performance integrations to be added
  tracesSampleRate: 0,
});

const provider = new NodeTracerProvider({
  sampler: new CustomSampler(),
});

// ...rest of your setup

// Validate that the setup is correct
Sentry.validateOpenTelemetrySetup();
```
