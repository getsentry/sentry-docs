<Alert>

Use this guide when you already have a completely custom OpenTelemetry setup or when you intend to add a custom OpenTelemetry setup next to the Sentry SDK.

If you are looking to simply add individual OpenTelemetry instrumentation to your Sentry setup, you should read <PlatformLink to="/opentelemetry/using-opentelemetry-apis/#adding-additional-opentelemetry-instrumentation">Adding Additional OpenTelemetry Instrumentation</PlatformLink> instead.

</Alert>

To use an existing OpenTelemetry setup, set `skipOpenTelemetrySetup: true` in your `init({})` config, then set up all the components that Sentry needs yourself. Finish by installing `@sentry/opentelemetry` and adding the following:

```javascript
const { NodeTracerProvider } = require("@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node");
const Sentry = require("@sentry/node");
const {
  SentrySpanProcessor,
  SentryPropagator,
  SentrySampler,
} = require("@sentry/opentelemetry");

const sentryClient = Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___DSN___",
  skipOpenTelemetrySetup: true,

  // The SentrySampler will use this to determine which traces to sample
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

// Note: This could be BasicTracerProvider or any other provider depending on
// how you are using the OpenTelemetry SDK
const provider = new NodeTracerProvider({
  // Ensure the correct subset of traces is sent to Sentry
  // This also ensures trace propagation works as expected
  sampler: sentryClient ? new SentrySampler(sentryClient) : undefined,
});

// Ensure spans are correctly linked & sent to Sentry
provider.addSpanProcessor(new SentrySpanProcessor());

provider.register({
  // Ensure trace propagation works
  // This relies on the SentrySampler for correct propagation
  propagator: new SentryPropagator(),
  // Ensure context & request isolation are correctly managed
  contextManager: new Sentry.SentryContextManager(),
});

// Validate that the setup is correct
Sentry.validateOpenTelemetrySetup();
```

Make sure that all [Required OpenTelemetry Instrumentation](./#required-instrumentation) is set up correctly. Otherwise, the Sentry SDK may not work as expected.

## Using Sentry for Error Monitoring Only

If you have a custom OpenTelemetry setup and only want to use Sentry for error monitoring, you can skip adding the `SentrySpanProcessor`. You'll still need to add the `SentryContextManager`, `SentryPropagator`, and `SentrySampler` to your setup even if you don't want to send any tracing data to Sentry. Read on to learn why this is needed.

In order for the Sentry SDK to work as expected, and for it to be in sync with OpenTelemetry, we need a few components to be in place.

**Components needed for Sentry to work correctly:**

- **SentryContextManager**: Ensures that the OpenTelemetry context is in sync with Sentry, for example to correctly isolate data between simultaneous requests.
- **SentrySampler**: Ensures that the Sentry `tracesSampleRate` is respected. Even if you don't use Sentry for tracing, you'll still need this in order for trace propagation to work as expected. Read [Using a Custom Sampler](./#using-a-custom-sampler) if you want to use a custom sampler.
- **SentryPropagator**: Ensures that trace propagation works correctly.
- [Required Instrumentation](./#required-instrumentation): Ensures that trace propagation works correctly.

**Additional components needed to also use Sentry for tracing:**

- **SentrySpanProcessor**: Ensures that spans are correctly sent to Sentry.

<Alert>
  Trace propagation is needed for Sentry to automatically connect services
  together. (For example, if you want to connect the frontend and backend, or
  different backend services.) This makes it possible to see related errors
  across services.{" "}

The following code snippet shows how to set up Sentry for error monitoring only:

```javascript
const { NodeTracerProvider } = require("@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node");
const Sentry = require("@sentry/node");
const { SentryPropagator, SentrySampler } = require("@sentry/opentelemetry");
const { registerInstrumentations } = require("@opentelemetry/instrumentation");

const sentryClient = Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___DSN___",
  skipOpenTelemetrySetup: true,

  // Important: We do not define a tracesSampleRate here at all!
  // This leads to tracing being disabled

  // Disable emitting of spans in the httpIntegration
  integrations: [Sentry.httpIntegration({ spans: false })],
});

// Create and configure e.g. NodeTracerProvider
const provider = new NodeTracerProvider({
  // This ensures trace propagation works as expected
  sampler: sentryClient ? new SentrySampler(sentryClient) : undefined,
});

provider.addSpanProcessor(
  new BatchSpanProcessor(
    new OTLPTraceExporter({
      url: "http://OTLP-ENDPOINT.com/api",
    })
  )
);

// Initialize the provider
provider.register({
  propagator: new SentryPropagator(),
  contextManager: new Sentry.SentryContextManager(),
});

registerInstrumentations({
  instrumentations: [
    // Add OTEL instrumentation here
  ],
});
```

## Required Instrumentation

By default, Sentry will register OpenTelemetry instrumentation to automatically capture spans for traces spanning incoming and outgoing HTTP requests, DB queries, and more.

If tracing is not enabled (no `tracesSampleRate` is defined in the SDK configuration), only a minimal amount of OpenTelemetry instrumentation will be registered. This includes the following:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}

- A Sentry-specific HTTP instrumentation that handles request isolation and trace propagation. This can work in parallel with [@opentelemetry/instrumentation-http](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@opentelemetry/instrumentation-http), if you register it.
- <PlatformLink to="/configuration/integrations/nodefetch/">nativeNodeFetchIntegration</PlatformLink> registers [opentelemetry-instrumentation-fetch-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/opentelemetry-instrumentation-fetch-node) which is needed for trace propagation.

{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

  <Alert>
    If tracing is not enabled, performance instrumentations will not be
    registered but they will still be included in the bundle. If you want to
    reduce the bundle size or used dependencies, you can also{" "}

      Set up Sentry without Performance Integrations
    </PlatformLink>
  </Alert>
</PlatformSection>

These are needed to make sure that trace propagation works correctly.

If you want to add your own http/node-fetch instrumentation, you have to follow the following steps:

### Custom HTTP Instrumentation

_Available since SDK version 8.35.0_

You can add your own `@opentelemetry/instrumentation-http` instance in your OpenTelemetry setup. However, in this case, you need to disable span creation in Sentry's `httpIntegration`:

```javascript
const sentryClient = Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___DSN___",
  skipOpenTelemetrySetup: true,
  integrations: [Sentry.httpIntegration({ spans: false })],
});
```

It's important that `httpIntegration` is still registered this way to ensure that the Sentry SDK can correctly isolate requests, for example when capturing errors.

### Custom Node Fetch Instrumentation

If tracing is disabled, the Node Fetch instrumentation will not emit any spans. In this scenario, it will only inject sentry-specific trace propagation headers. You are free to add your own Node Fetch instrumentation on top of this which may emit spans as you like.

## Using a Custom Sampler

While you can use your own sampler, we recommend that you use the `SentrySampler`. This will ensure that the correct subset of traces will be sent to Sentry, based on your `tracesSampleRate`. It will also ensure that all other Sentry features like trace propagation work as expected. If you do need to use your own sampler, make sure to wrap your `SamplingResult` with our `wrapSamplingDecision` method like in the example below:

```javascript
const { NodeTracerProvider } = require("@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node");
const Sentry = require("@sentry/node");
const {
  SentrySpanProcessor,
  SentryPropagator,
  SentrySampler,
  wrapSamplingDecision,
} = require("@sentry/opentelemetry");

// implements Sampler from "@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node"
class CustomSampler {
  shouldSample(context, _traceId, _spanName, _spanKind, attributes, _links) {
    const decision = yourDecisionLogic();

    // wrap the result
    return wrapSamplingDecision({
      decision,
      context,
      spanAttributes: attributes,
    });
  }

  toString() {
    return CustomSampler.name;
  }
}

const sentryClient = Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___DSN___",
  skipOpenTelemetrySetup: true,

  // By defining any sample rate,
  // tracing intergations will be added by default
  // omit this if you do not want any performance integrations to be added
  tracesSampleRate: 0,
});

const provider = new NodeTracerProvider({
  sampler: new CustomSampler(),
});

// ...rest of your setup

// Validate that the setup is correct
Sentry.validateOpenTelemetrySetup();
```

## ESM Loaders

If your application is running in ESM (`import`/`export` syntax), OpenTelemetry requires you to set up _ESM loader hooks_.

The Sentry SDK will automatically register ESM loader hooks by default.
However, if you have your own OpenTelemetry setup, it is recommended to configure the Sentry SDK to not register these hooks and instead register them yourself.
You can do so by setting `registerEsmLoaderHooks` to `false` and [setting up ESM loader hooks](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js/blob/main/doc/esm-support.md#instrumentation-hook-required-for-esm):

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___DSN___",
  skipOpenTelemetrySetup: true,
  registerEsmLoaderHooks: false,
});
```

<Alert title="Why is it recommended to register loader hooks yourself?">

It is recommended registering your own ESM loader hooks when you have a complete custom OpenTelemetry setup, first and foremost because it makes the most sense architecturally.
You likely went through the effort to set up OpenTelemetry by itself and now you want to add Sentry to your application without messing with your OpenTelemetry setup.

Additionally, there are a few pitfalls that can very simply be avoided by registering your own hooks:

- Registering loader hooks multiple times might result in duplicated spans being created. [More details.](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/14065#issuecomment-2435546961)
- OpenTelemetry instrumentation in ESM is very sensitive as to _when_ it is added relative to _when_ the loader hooks are registered.
  The control over this should stay with the owner of the OpenTelemetry setup and not the Sentry SDK.
