If you already have OpenTelemetry set up yourself, you can also use your existing setup.

In this case, you need to set `skipOpenTelemetrySetup: true` in your `init({})` config, and ensure you setup all the
components that Sentry needs yourself. In this case, you need to install `@sentry/opentelemetry`, and add the following:

```javascript
const { NodeTracerProvider } = require("@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node");
const Sentry = require("@sentry/node");
const {
  SentrySpanProcessor,
  SentryPropagator,
  SentrySampler,
} = require("@sentry/opentelemetry");

const sentryClient = Sentry.init({
  dsn: "__DSN__",
  skipOpenTelemetrySetup: true,

  // The SentrySampler will use this to determine which traces to sample
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

// Note: This could be BasicTracerProvider or any other provider depending on
// how you are using the OpenTelemetry SDK
const provider = new NodeTracerProvider({
  // Ensure the correct subset of traces is sent to Sentry
  // This also ensures trace propagation works as expected
  sampler: sentryClient ? new SentrySampler(sentryClient) : undefined,
});

// Ensure spans are correctly linked & sent to Sentry
provider.addSpanProcessor(new SentrySpanProcessor());

provider.register({
  // Ensure trace propagation works
  // This relies on the SentrySampler for correct propagation
  propagator: new SentryPropagator(),
  // Ensure context & request isolation are correctly managed
  contextManager: new Sentry.SentryContextManager(),
});

// Validate that the setup is correct
Sentry.validateOpenTelemetrySetup();
```

Make sure that all <PlatformLink to="/opentelemetry/required-instrumentation/">Required OpenTelemetry Instrumentation</PlatformLink> is set up correctly - otherwise, the Sentry SDK may not work as expected!

## Using Sentry for Error Monitoring only

If you have a custom OpenTelemetry setup and only want to use Sentry for error monitoring, you can skip adding the `SentrySpanProcessor`. You will still need to add the `SentryContextManager`, `SentryPropagator` and `SentrySampler` to your setup even if you do not want to sent any tracing data to Sentry. See below on an explanation of why this is needed.

## Why do I need to do this?

In order for the Sentry SDK to work as expected, and for it to be able to be in sync with OpenTelemetry, we need a few components to be in place. These are needed even if you only use Sentry for error monitoring:

- **SentryContextManager**: This is needed to ensure that the OpenTelemetry context is in sync with Sentry.
- **SentrySampler**: This is needed to ensure that the Sentry `tracesSampleRate` is respected. Even if you do not use Sentry for tracing, you still need this in order for trace propagation to work as expected. See <PlatformLink to='/opentelemetry/sampler'>Using a Custom OpenTelemetry Sampler</PlatformLink> if you want to use a custom sampler.
- **SentryPropagator**: This is needed to ensure that trace propagation works correctly.
- <PlatformLink to="/opentelemetry/required-instrumentation">Required Instrumentation</PlatformLink>: These are needed to ensure that trace propagation works correctly.

<Note>
  Trace propagation is needed for Sentry to automatically connect services (e.g.
  frontend and backend, or different backend services) together. This makes it
  possible to see related errors across services.

The following is only needed if you use Sentry for tracing:

- **SentrySpanProcessor**: This is needed to ensure spans are correctly sent to Sentry.
