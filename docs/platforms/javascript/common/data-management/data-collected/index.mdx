Sentry takes data privacy very seriously and has default settings in place that prioritize data safety, especially when it comes to personally identifiable information (PII) data. When you add the Sentry SDK to your application, you allow it to collect data and send it to Sentry during the runtime of your application.

The category types and amount of data collected vary, depending on the integrations you've enabled in the Sentry SDK. This page lists data categories that the Sentry Android SDK collects.

Many of the categories listed here require you to enable the <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#sendDefaultPii">sendDefaultPii option</PlatformLink>.

## HTTP Headers

By default, the Sentry SDK doesn't send any HTTP response or request headers.

To start sending HTTP headers, set <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#sendDefaultPii">`sendDefaultPii: true`</PlatformLink>.

## Cookies

By default, the Sentry SDK doesn't send cookies. Sentry tries to remove any cookies that contain sensitive information, such as the Session ID and CSRF Token cookies in Django.

If you want to send cookies, set `sendDefaultPii: true` in the `Sentry.init()` call. This will send the cookie headers `Cookie` and `Set-Cookie` from fetch and XHR requests.

## Information About Logged-in User

By default, the Sentry SDK doesn't send any information about the logged-in user, such as email address, user ID, or username. Even if enabled, the type of logged-in user information you'll be able to send depends on the integrations you enable in Sentry's SDK. Most integrations won't send any user information. Some will only set the user ID, but there are a few (e.g. <PlatformLink to="/user-feedback/">User Feedback</PlatformLink>) that will set the user ID, username, and email address.

To start sending logged-in user information, set <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#sendDefaultPii">`sendDefaultPii: true`</PlatformLink> in your `Sentry.init({})` config.

## Users' IP Address and Location

By default, the Sentry SDK doesn't send the user's IP address.

To enable sending the user's IP address and infer the location, set <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#sendDefaultPii">`sendDefaultPii: true`</PlatformLink>. In some integrations such as <PlatformLink to="/guides/astro/#customize-server-instrumentation">`handleRequest`</PlatformLink> in Astro, you can send the user's IP address by enabling `trackClientIp`.

If sending the IP address is enabled we will try to infer the IP address or use the IP address provided by `ip_address` in <PlatformLink to="/apis/#setUser">`Sentry.setUser()`</PlatformLink>. If you set `ip_address: null`, the IP address won't be inferred.

## Request URL

The full request URL of outgoing and incoming HTTP requests is **always sent to Sentry**. Depending on your application, this could contain PII data. For example, a URL like `/users/1234/details`, where `1234` is a user id (which may be considered PII).

## Request Query String

The full request query string of outgoing and incoming HTTP requests is **always sent to Sentry**. Depending on your application, this could contain PII data.

## Request Body

- **The type of the request body:**
  - JSON and HTML Form bodies are sent
- **The size of the request body:** There's a <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#max-request-body-size">maxRequestBodySize</PlatformLink> option that's set to `NONE` by default. This means by default no request body is sent to Sentry.

## Response Body

By default, the Sentry SDK doesn't send the content of response bodies. By default, the SDK will send the response body size based on the `content-length` header.

## Source Context

By default, using the Sentry CLI Wizard will enable uploading source maps to Sentry.

To disable source map upload, see <PlatformLink to="/sourcemaps">the Source Maps documentation</PlatformLink>.

## Local Variables In Stack Trace

By default, the Sentry SDK will not send local variables in the error stack trace in client-side JavaScript SDKs.

<PlatformSection notSupported={["javascript", "javascript.angular", "javascript.capacitor", "javascript.cordova", "javascript.ember", "javascript.gatsby", "javascript.react", "javascript.solid", "javascript.svelte", "javascript.vue", "javascript.wasm"]}>
  You can enable sending local variables by setting `includeLocalVariables: true` in the `Sentry.init()` call. This activates the <PlatformLink to="/configuration/integrations/localvariables">Local Variables Integration</PlatformLink>. The integration is added by default in Node.js-based runtimes.
</PlatformSection>

## Device, Browser, OS and Runtime Information

By default, the Sentry SDK sends information about the device and runtime to Sentry.

In browser environments, this information is obtained by the User Agent string. The User Agent string contains information about the browser, operating system, and device type.

In server-side environments, the Sentry SDK uses the `os` module to get information about the operating system and architecture.

<PlatformSection notSupported={["javascript.azure-functions", "javascript.bun", "javascript.deno", "javascript.node", "javascript.aws-lambda", "javascript.connect", "javascript.cloudflare", "javascript.express", "javascript.fastify", "javascript.gcp-functions", "javascript.hapi",  "javascript.hono", "javascript.koa", "javascript.nestjs", "javascript.wasm"]}>
  <PlatformSection notSupported={["javascript.cordova"]}>
    ## Session Replay

    By default, our Session Replay SDK masks all text content, images, web views, and user input. This helps ensure that no sensitive data is exposed. You can find <PlatformLink to="/session-replay/privacy/">more details in the Session Replay documentation</PlatformLink>.
  </PlatformSection>

  ## Referrer URL

  By default, the Sentry SDK sends the referrer URL to Sentry. This is the URL of the page that linked to the current page.

  ## Console Logs

  By default, the Sentry SDK sends JS console logs to Sentry which may contain PII data.

  To disable sending console messages, set `console: false` in your `Sentry.breadcrumbsIntegration` config, see <PlatformLink to="/configuration/integrations/breadcrumbs/">the Breadcrumbs documentation</PlatformLink>.

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection notSupported={["javascript", "javascript.angular", "javascript.capacitor", "javascript.cloudflare", "javascript.cordova", "javascript.ember", "javascript.gatsby", "javascript.react", "javascript.solid", "javascript.svelte", "javascript.vue", "javascript.wasm"]}>
  <PlatformSection notSupported={["javascript.fastify", "javascript.hono"]}>
    ## Stack Trace Context Lines

    By default, the <PlatformLink to="/configuration/integrations/contextlines/">Context Lines Integration</PlatformLink> is enabled. This integration sends the surrounding lines of code for each frame in the stack trace. This can include PII data if the code contains PII information.
  </PlatformSection>

  <PlatformSection notSupported={["javascript.deno"]}>
    ## LLM Inputs And Responses

    When using the <PlatformLink to="/configuration/integrations/vercelai/">Vercel AI Integration</PlatformLink>, the used prompt is sent to Sentry along with meta data like model ID and used tokens. Check out the full list of attributes [in the code](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/master/packages/node/src/integrations/tracing/vercelai/index.ts).

    ## Database Queries

    By default, the Sentry SDK sends SQL queries to Sentry. The SQL queries can include PII information if the statement is not parametrized.

    MongoDB queries are sent as well, but the Sentry SDK will not send the full MongoDB query. Instead, it will send a parameterized version of the query.

  </PlatformSection>

  ## tRPC Context

  By default, the Sentry SDK doesn't send tRPC input from the tRPC context.

  If you want to send the tRPC input you can enable it by setting `sendDefaultPii: true` in the `Sentry.init()` call or by setting `attachRpcInput: true` in the <PlatformLink to="/configuration/integrations/trpc/">`Sentry.trpcMiddleware()`</PlatformLink> options.
