## Setup Methods

Choose the method that matches your current setup:

* [UI Setup](ui-setup) - Create monitors in Sentry's web interface, then add instrumentation

### Automatic Integration

* [node-cron](node-cron) - Auto-instrument node-cron library
* [cron](cron-library) - Auto-instrument cron library
* [node-schedule](node-schedule) - Auto-instrument node-schedule library

If you're using one of these popular cron libraries, use the automatic integration for seamless monitoring.

### Manual Methods

* [Job Monitoring](job-monitoring) - Use withMonitor wrapper for automatic status tracking
* [Check-Ins](check-ins) - Full control with manual status updates
* [Heartbeat](heartbeat) - Simple success/failure notifications
* [Upserting Monitors](upserting-monitors) - Programmatic monitor creation and management

### Alternative Methods (Not Recommended)

These methods work but don't provide the full benefits of SDK integration like tracing and error context:

* [Sentry CLI](https://docs.sentry.io/cli/crons/) - Command-line tool for basic monitoring
* [HTTP API](https://docs.sentry.io/product/crons/getting-started/http/) - Direct API calls for check-ins

### Other Tools

If you have custom cron logic or use a different scheduling library, we recommend [Check-Ins](check-ins) which gives you full control over when and how status updates are sent.

For advanced use cases like CI/CD pipelines or managing many monitors, consider [Upserting Monitors](upserting-monitors) which lets you create monitors programmatically via code.

## Alerts

When your recurring job fails to check in (missed), runs beyond its configured maximum runtime (failed), or manually reports a failure, Sentry will create an error event with a tag to your monitor.

To receive alerts about these events:

1. Navigate to **Alerts** in the sidebar.
2. Create a new alert and select "Issues" under "Errors" as the alert type.
3. Configure your alert and define a filter match to use: `The event's tags match {key} {match} {value}`.

Example: `The event's tags match monitor.slug equals my-monitor-slug-here`

Learn more in [Issue Alert Configuration](/product/alerts/alert-types/#issue-alerts).

## Rate Limits

Crons imposes a rate limit on check-ins to prevent abuse and resource overuse. Specifically, you can only send a maximum of **6 check-ins per minute per existing monitor environment**. This limit is enforced on a per-project basis, meaning that the rate limit applies collectively to all monitor environments within a given project. You can check if any of your check-ins are being dropped in the [Usage Stats](/product/stats/) page.

To avoid dropped check-ins, it is crucial to manage and distribute your check-ins efficiently within the rate limits. This will help maintain accurate monitoring and ensure that all critical check-ins are captured and processed.
