Check-in monitoring allows you to track a job's progress by completing two check-ins: one at the start of your job and another at the end of your job. This two-step process allows Sentry to notify you if your job didn't start when expected (missed) or if it exceeded its maximum runtime (failed).

```javascript
// ðŸŸ¡ Notify Sentry your job is running:
const checkInId = Sentry.captureCheckIn({
  monitorSlug: "<monitor-slug>",
  status: "in_progress",
});

// Execute your scheduled task here...

// ðŸŸ¢ Notify Sentry your job has completed successfully:
Sentry.captureCheckIn({
  // Make sure this variable is named `checkInId`
  checkInId,
  monitorSlug: "<monitor-slug>",
  status: "ok",
});
```

If your job execution fails, you can notify Sentry about the failure:

```javascript
// ðŸ”´ Notify Sentry your job has failed:
Sentry.captureCheckIn({
  // Make sure this variable is named `checkInId`
  checkInId,
  monitorSlug: "<monitor-slug>",
  status: "error",
});
```
