Common issues and solutions for JavaScript cron monitoring setup.

<Expandable title="Why aren't recurring job errors showing up on my monitor details page?">

Errors that happen outside of job execution aren't linked to cron monitors. The most common situation is an error occurring in an external service, like a database or API call, that isn't directly part of the job function. In such cases, make sure the job function execution includes any external service calls. If you have a job that starts a service outside of the job function, you should execute the service call directly within the job function.

<Expandable title="Why am I not receiving alerts when my monitor fails?">

Alert notifications are based on notification settings. If you're not receiving alerts when a monitor fails or experiences an issue, make sure you've configured an alert rule for the monitor.

To configure an alert rule:

1. Go to **Alerts** and click "Create Alert Rule".
2. Set "Issues" as the alert type under **Errors**.
3. Set the conditions to: `The event's tags match monitor.slug equals your-monitor-slug-here`

Learn more about [Issue Alert Configuration](/product/alerts/alert-types/#issue-alerts).

<Expandable title="What is the crons data retention policy for check-ins?">

Check-in data is retained for **90 days**. After this period, check-in history is automatically removed.

</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Do you support a monitor schedule with a six-field crontab expression?">

Currently, Sentry only supports **five-field crontab expressions** (minute, hour, day, month, weekday). Six-field expressions with seconds are not supported.

**Supported**: `0 */2 * * *` (every 2 hours)  
**Not supported**: `0 0 */2 * * *` (every 2 hours with seconds field)
