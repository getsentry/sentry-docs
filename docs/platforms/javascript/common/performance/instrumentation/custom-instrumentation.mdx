<Note>

To capture transactions and spans customized to your organization's needs, you must first <PlatformLink to="/performance/">set up performance monitoring.</PlatformLink>

</Note>

To add custom performance data to your application, you need to add custom instrumentation in the form of spans. Spans are a way to measure the time it takes for a specific action to occur. For example, you can create a span to measure the time it takes for a function to execute.

To get started, import the SDK.

## Start Span

By default, spans you create are considered active, which means they are put on the Sentry scope. This allows child spans and Sentry errors to be associated with that span. This is the recommended way to create spans.

## Start Inactive Spans

To add spans that aren't active, you can create independent spans. This is useful for when you have work that is grouped together under a single parent span, but is independent from the current active span. However, in most cases you'll want to create and use the start span API from above.

## Adding Span operations

Spans can have an operation associated with them, which help activate Sentry identify additional context about the span. For example database related spans have the `db` span operation associated with them. The Sentry product offers additional controls, visualizations and filters for spans with known operations.

Sentry maintains a [list of well known span operations](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/performance/span-operations/#list-of-operations) and it is recommended that you use one of those operations if it is applicable to your span.
