When an event is captured and sent to Sentry, SDKs will merge that event data with extra
information from the current scope. SDKs will typically automatically manage the scopes
for you in the framework integrations and you don't need to think about them. However,
you should know what a scope is and how you can use it for your advantage.

## What's a Scope, What's a Hub

You can think of the hub as the central point that our SDKs use to route an
event to Sentry. When you call `init()` a hub is created and a client and a
blank scope are created on it. That hub is then associated with the current
thread and will internally hold a stack of scopes.

The scope will hold useful information that should be sent along with the
event. For instance [contexts](../context/) or
[breadcrumbs](../breadcrumbs/) are stored on
the scope. When a scope is pushed, it inherits all data from the parent scope
and when it pops all modifications are reverted.

The default SDK integrations will push and pop scopes intelligently. For
instance web framework integrations will create and destroy scopes around your
routes or controllers.

## How the Scope and Hub Work

As you start using an SDK, a scope and hub are automatically created for you out
of the box. It's unlikely that you'll interact with the hub directly unless you're
writing an integration or you want to create or destroy scopes. Scopes, on the
other hand are more user facing. You can call <PlatformIdentifier name="configure-scope" /> at any point in
time to modify data stored on the scope. This is useful for doing things like
[modifying the context](../context/).

When you call a global function such as <PlatformIdentifier name="capture-event" /> internally Sentry
discovers the current hub and asks it to capture an event. Internally the hub will
then merge the event with the topmost scope's data.

## Configuring the Scope

There are two main ways to interact with the scope. You can access the current scope via `Sentry.getCurrentScope()` and use setters on the resulting scope, or you can use global methods like `Sentry.setTag()` directly, which will set on the respective scope under the hood.

You'll first need to import the SDK, as usual:

<PlatformContent includePath="enriching-events/import" />

You can, for instance, add custom tags or inform Sentry about the currently authenticated user.

```javascript
const scope = Sentry.getCurrentScope();
scope.setTag("my-tag", "my value");
scope.setUser({
  id: 42,
  email: "john.doe@example.com",
});

// Or use the global methods
Sentry.setTag("my-tag", "my value");
Sentry.setUser({
  id: 42,
  email: "john.doe@example.com",
});
```

To learn what useful information can be associated with scopes see
[context](../context/), [tags](../tags), [users](../identify-user) and [breadcrumbs](../breadcrumbs/).

## Local Scopes

We also support pushing and configuring a scope within a single call. This is typically
called <PlatformIdentifier name="with-scope" />, <PlatformIdentifier name="push-scope" /> or implemented as a function parameter on the capture methods, depending on the SDK. It's very helpful if
you only want to send data for one specific event.

### Using <PlatformIdentifier name="with-scope" />

In the following example we use <PlatformIdentifier name="with-scope" /> to attach a `level` and a `tag` to only one specific error:

<PlatformContent includePath="enriching-events/scopes/with-scope" />

The scope inside the `withScope()` callback is only valid inside of the callback. Once the callback ends, the scope will be removed and no longer applied. The inner scope is only applied to events that are captured inside of the callback. `withScope()` will clone (or fork) the current scope, so that the current scope is not modified. This allows you to
more easily isolate pieces of context information to specific locations in your code or
even call <PlatformIdentifier name="clear" /> to briefly remove all context information.
