In server-side environments, the <PlatformLink to='/enriching-events/scopes'>isolation scope</PlatformLink> is automatically forked around request boundaries. This means that each request will have its own isolation scope, and data set on the isolation scope will only apply to events captured during that request. This is done automatically by the SDK.

However, tehre are also other cases where you may want to have isolation, for example in background jobs or when you want to isolate a specific part of your code. In these cases, you can use `Sentry.withIsolationScope()` to create a new isolation scope that is valid inside of the callback you pass to it - see [Using withIsolationScope](../scopes/#using-withisolationscope).

The following example shows how you can use `withIsolationScope` to attach data for a specific job run:

```javascript
async function job(jobId) {
  return Sentry.withIsolationScope(async () => {
    // Only valid for events in this callback
    Sentry.setTag("jobId", jobId);
    await doSomething();
  });
}
```
