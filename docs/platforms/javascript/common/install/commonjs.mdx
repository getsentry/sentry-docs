<Alert>
  Are you unsure if you should use this installation method? Review our
  [installation methods](../).
</Alert>

Most node applications today are either written in CommonJS (CJS), or compiled to CJS before running them.
CommonJS uses `require()` to load modules. Our recommended installation method when using CommonJS is to require the `instrument.js` file at the top of your application.

You need to create a file named `instrument.js` that imports and initializes Sentry:

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-config" />

You need to require or import the `instrument.js` file before requiring any other modules in your application. This is necessary to ensure that Sentry can automatically instrument all modules in your application:

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-use" />
