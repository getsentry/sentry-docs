When running your application in ESM mode, you can't use `require()` to load modules. Instead, you have to use the  `--import` command line options to load a module before the application starts:

Adjust the Node.js call for your application to use the [--import](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--importmodule) parameter and point it at `instrument.js`, which contains your `Sentry.init()` code:

```bash
# Note: This is only available for Node v18.19.0 onwards.
node --import ./instrument.mjs app.mjs
```

We do not support ESM in Node versions before 18.19.0.

## When to use this

Most node applications today are either written in CommonJS (CJS), or compiled to CJS before running them.
CommonJS uses `require()` to load modules. Our recommended installation method when using CommonJS is to require the `instrument.js` file at the top of your application. However, if your application is run in ESM mode, this will not work. In this case, you can follow the [ESM docs](./esm).

Note that even if your application is written in ESM (using `import`), it may still be _run_ in CJS. For example, almost all applications written in TypeScript are compiled to CJS before running them. In this case, you should follow the CommonJS instructions.
