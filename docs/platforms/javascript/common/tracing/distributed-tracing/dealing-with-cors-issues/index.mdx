If your frontend and backend are hosted on different domains (for example, your frontend is on `https://example.com` and your backend is on `https://api.example.com`), you may need to configure your backend [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Headers) headers to ensure distributed tracing works properly.

## Understanding Trace Propagation

Sentry doesn't attach the `sentry-trace` and `baggage` headers to every outgoing request. Instead, it only attaches these headers to requests whose URLs match the patterns specified in the `tracePropagationTargets` configuration option.

**By default**, `tracePropagationTargets` is set to `['localhost', /^\//]`, which means trace headers are only attached to:
- Requests containing `localhost` in their URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/api`)
- Requests whose URL starts with `/` (e.g., `/api/users`, `/graphql`)

This default behavior helps prevent sending trace data to third-party services and reduces potential CORS issues.

## Configuring Trace Propagation

To enable distributed tracing across different domains, you need to configure `tracePropagationTargets` to include the URLs of your backend services:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [Sentry.browserTracingIntegration()],
  tracePropagationTargets: [
    "localhost",           // For local development
    /^\/api\//,           // For same-origin API calls
    "https://api.example.com", // For your backend domain
    "https://auth.example.com" // For additional services
  ],
});
```

## Configuring CORS Headers

Once you've configured `tracePropagationTargets` to include your backend domains, you need to configure your backend to allow the trace headers:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: sentry-trace, baggage
```

Your server's exact configuration will depend on your setup, but the important part is allowing both the `sentry-trace` and `baggage` headers.

## Example Scenarios

### Single Backend Domain

If your frontend calls a single backend domain:

```javascript
// Frontend configuration
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  tracePropagationTargets: [
    "localhost",              // For development
    "https://api.example.com" // Your backend
  ],
});
```

```
# Backend CORS configuration
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: sentry-trace, baggage
```

### Multiple Services

If your frontend calls multiple backend services:

```javascript
// Frontend configuration
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  tracePropagationTargets: [
    "localhost",
    "https://api.example.com",
    "https://auth.example.com",
    "https://media.example.com"
  ],
});
```

Each backend service needs to allow the headers in their CORS configuration.

### Disabling Trace Propagation

If you want to disable distributed tracing entirely and ensure no trace headers are sent:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  // Empty array prevents all trace header propagation
  tracePropagationTargets: [],
});
```
