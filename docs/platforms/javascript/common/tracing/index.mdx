With [tracing](/product/performance/), Sentry tracks your software performance, measuring metrics like throughput and latency, and displaying the impact of errors across multiple systems. Sentry captures distributed traces consisting of transactions and spans, which measure individual services and individual operations within those services. Learn more about our model in [Distributed Tracing](/product/sentry-basics/tracing/distributed-tracing/).

<PlatformCategorySection supported={["server", "serverless"]}>
<Note>

If you’re adopting Tracing in a high-throughput environment, we recommend testing prior to deployment to ensure that your service’s performance characteristics maintain expectations.

</PlatformSection>

- Setting a uniform sample rate for all transactions using the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> option in your SDK config to a number between `0` and `1`. (For example, to send 20% of transactions, set <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> to `0.2`.)
- Controlling the sample rate based on the transaction itself and the context in which it's captured, by providing a function to the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> config option.

The two options are meant to be mutually exclusive. If you set both, <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> will take precedence.

## Verify

<PlatformSection supported={["javascript"]} notSupported={["javascript.cordova"]}>

Verify that tracing is working correctly by using our <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/">automatic instrumentation</PlatformLink> or by starting and finishing a transaction using <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation/">custom instrumentation</PlatformLink>.

</PlatformSection>

While you're testing, set <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> to `1.0`, as that ensures that every transaction will be sent to Sentry. Once testing is complete, you may want to set a lower <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> value, or switch to using <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> to selectively sample and filter your transactions, based on contextual data.

If you leave your sample rate at `1.0`, a transaction will be sent every time a user loads a page or navigates within your app. Depending on the amount of traffic your application gets, this may mean a lot of transactions. If you have a high-load, backend application, you may want to consider setting a lower <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> value, or switching to using <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> to selectively sample and filter your transactions, based on contextual data.
