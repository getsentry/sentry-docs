description: "Learn about the Issue types that Session Replay can detect."
---

A _[replay issue](/product/issues/issue-details/replay-issues/)_ is an issue detected using captured Session Replay data. If your application is configured with [Session Replay](/product/session-replay/) problems will be detected on the server side during replay ingest, and grouped into issues. We group similar events into issues based on a fingerprint. For replay issues, a fingerprint is primarily based on the problem type and the url or transaction name where the problem occurred.

You can configure which issue types are created by visiting Project Settings > Replay and toggling detection on or off for each issue types.
