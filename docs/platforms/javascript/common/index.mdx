## Prerequisites

You need:

- A Sentry [account](https://sentry.io/signup/) and [project](/product/projects/)
- Your application up and running

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection notSupported={["javascript.deno"]}>

<PlatformSection notSupported={["javascript", "javascript.astro", "javascript.cordova", "javascript.nextjs", "javascript.nuxt", "javascript.remix", "javascript.solidstart", "javascript.sveltekit", "javascript.bun", "javascript.cloudflare", "javascript.react-router"]}>

## Features

In addition to capturing errors, you can monitor interactions between multiple services or applications by [enabling tracing](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/). You can also get to the root of an error or performance issue faster, by watching a video-like reproduction of a user session with [session replay](/product/explore/session-replay/web/getting-started/).

## Configure

<PlatformSection notSupported={["javascript.nextjs", "javascript.astro", "javascript.react", "javascript.react-router"]}>

Configuration should happen as early as possible in your application's lifecycle.

</PlatformSection>
