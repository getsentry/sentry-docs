## Prerequisites

* You have the <PlatformLink to="/">Javascript SDK installed</PlatformLink> (version 8.41.0-beta.0 or higher).

## Enable Evaluation Tracking

Evaluation tracking requires enabling an SDK integration. Integrations are provider specific. Documentation for supported providers is listed below.

- [OpenFeature](/platforms/javascript/configuration/integrations/openfeature/)
- [LaunchDarkly](/platforms/javascript/configuration/integrations/launchdarkly/)

## Enable Change Tracking

Change tracking requires registering a Sentry webhook with your feature flag provider. Set up varies by provider and is documented in detail [here](/product/explore/feature-flags/#set-up-your-integration-specific-webhook).
