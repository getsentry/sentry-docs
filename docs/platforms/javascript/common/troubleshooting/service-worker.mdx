## Fixing invalid file hashes in `ngsw.json` after injecting debugIds

if `debugIds` are injected into the chunks of the build, the file hashes in `ngsw.json` become invalid and can no longer be cached by the serviceworker. To resolve this issue, regenerate `ngsw.json` after the `debugIds` have been injected using the following command:
```bash
node_modules/.bin/ngsw-config <dist> <config>
```

* `dist` Path to the built chunk files. The `ngsw.json` with the old hashes should be located there.
* `config` Location of `ngsw-config.json` (should be in project root)
