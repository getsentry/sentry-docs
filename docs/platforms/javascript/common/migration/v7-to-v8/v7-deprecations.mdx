To fix most of the deprecations on `7.x`, you can use the [`@sentry/migr8`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/migr8) codemod to automatically update your SDK usage. `@sentry/migr8` requires Node 18+.

```bash
npx @sentry/migr8@latest
```

Our migration tool will let you select which updates to run, and automatically update your code. In some cases, we cannot automatically change code for you. These will be marked with a `TODO(sentry)` comment instead. Make sure to review all code changes after running `@sentry/migr8`!

See our [detailed migration docs](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/develop/MIGRATION.md#deprecations-in-7x) on GitHub for more details.
