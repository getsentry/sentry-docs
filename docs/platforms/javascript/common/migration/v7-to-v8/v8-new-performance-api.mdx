The SDK `8.x` release introduces new APIs for performance monitoring. These APIs are designed to provide more control over how performance data is collected and reported to Sentry.

These APIs are also available in `7.x` so you can incrementally move over to the new APIs before upgrading to `8.x`.

Previously, there were two key APIs for adding manual performance instrumentation to your applications:

- `startTransaction()`
- `span.startChild()`

Those APIs were based on the original data model of Sentry. This model was based on a root Transaction that could contain a nested tree of Spans.

In the new model, transactions are conceptually gone. Now, operations are always performed on spans, regardless of their position in the tree. Note that spans may still be grouped into a transaction for the Sentry UI. However, this happens in the background and, from the SDK's point of view, all you need to be concerned about are spans.

The new model does not differentiate between a transaction or a span when manually starting or ending them. Instead, you always use the same APIs to start a new span. This will automatically create either a new Root Span (a regular span without a parent, conceptually similar to a transaction) or a Child Span, depending on what is the currently active span.

There are three key APIs available to start spans:

- `startSpan()`
- `startSpanManual()`
- `startInactiveSpan()`

All three span APIs take `StartSpanOptions` as a first argument, which has the following shape:

```TypeScript
interface StartSpanOptions {
  // The only required field - the name of the span
  name: string;
  attributes?: SpanAttributes;
  op?: string;
  scope?: Scope;
  forceTransaction?: boolean;
}
```

### `startSpan()`

This is the most common API that should be used in most circumstances. It will start a new span, making it the active span
for the duration of a given callback, and automatically ends it when the callback ends. You can use it like this:

```js
Sentry.startSpan(
  {
    name: "my-span",
    attributes: {
      attr1: "my-attribute",
      attr2: 123,
    },
  },
  (span) => {
    // do something that you want to measure
    // once this is done, the span is automatically ended
  }
);
```

You can also pass an async function:

```js
Sentry.startSpan(
  {
    name: "my-span",
    attributes: {},
  },
  async (span) => {
    // do something that you want to measure
    await waitOnSomething();
    // once this is done, the span is automatically ended
  }
);
```

Since `startSpan()` will make the created span the active span, any automatic or manual instrumentation that creates
spans inside of the callback will attach new spans as children of the span we just started.

Note that if an error is thrown inside of the callback, the span status will automatically be set to be errored.

### `startSpanManual()`

This is a variation of `startSpan()` with the only difference that it does not automatically end the span when the callback
ends. When using this, you have to call `span.end()` yourself:

```js
Sentry.startSpanManual(
  {
    name: "my-span",
  },
  (span) => {
    // do something that you want to measure

    // Now manually end the span ourselves
    span.end();
  }
);
```

In most cases, `startSpan()` should be all you need for manual instrumentation. But if you find yourself in a place
where the automatic ending of spans, for whatever reason, does not work for you, you can use `startSpanManual()`
instead.

This function will _also_ set the created span as the active span for the duration of the callback, and will _also_
update the span status to be errored if there is an error thrown inside of the callback.

### `startInactiveSpan()`

In contrast to the other two methods, this does not take a callback and this does not make the created span the active
span. You can use this method if you want to create loose spans that do not need to have any children:

```js
Sentry.startSpan({ name: "outer" }, () => {
  const inner1 = Sentry.startInactiveSpan({ name: "inner1" });
  const inner2 = Sentry.startInactiveSpan({ name: "inner2" });

  // do something

  // manually end the spans
  inner1.end();
  inner2.end();
});
```

No span will ever be created as a child span of an inactive span.

### Creating a child span of a specific span

You can use the `withActiveSpan` helper to create a span as a child of a specific span:

```js
Sentry.withActiveSpan(parentSpan, () => {
  Sentry.startSpan({ name: "my-span" }, (span) => {
    // span will be a direct child of parentSpan
  });
});
```

### Creating a transaction

While in most cases, you shouldn't have to think about creating a span vs. a transaction (just call `startSpan()` and
we'll do the appropriate thing under the hood), there may still be times where you _need_ to ensure you create a
transaction (for example, if you need to see it as a transaction in the Sentry UI). For these cases, you can pass
`forceTransaction: true` to the start-span APIs, e.g.:

```js
const transaction = Sentry.startInactiveSpan({
  name: "transaction",
  forceTransaction: true,
});
```

## The Span schema

Previously, spans & transactions had a bunch of properties and methods to be used. Most of these have been removed in
favor of a slimmer, more straightforward API, which is also aligned with OpenTelemetry Spans. You can refer to the table
below to see which things used to exist, and how they can/should be mapped going forward:

The `spanToJSON`, `getRootSpan`, `setHttpStatus`, `spanToTraceHeader`, and `spanToTraceContext` are all exported by the SDK to be used.

| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |

| `span.transaction`         | `getRootSpan(span)`                                         |
| `span.instrumenter`        | Removed                                                     |
| `span.finish()`            | `span.end()`                                                |
| `span.end()`               | Same                                                        |
| `span.setTag()`            | `span.setAttribute()`, or set tags on the scope             |

| `span.setStatus()`         | `span.setStatus` - note that this has a different signature |
| `span.setHttpStatus()`     | `setHttpStatus(span, status)`                               |
| `span.setName()`           | `span.updateName()`                                         |
| `span.startChild()`        | Call `Sentry.startSpan()` independently                     |
| `span.isSuccess()`         | `spanToJSON(span).status === 'ok'`                          |
| `span.toTraceparent()`     | `spanToTraceHeader(span)`                                   |

| `span.updateWithContext()` | Removed                                                     |
| `span.getTraceContext()`   | `spanToTraceContext(span)`                                  |

In addition, a transaction has this API:

| Old name                    | Replace with                                     |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `name`                      | `spanToJSON(span).description`                   |
| `trimEnd`                   | Removed                                          |
| `parentSampled`             | `spanIsSampled(span)` & `spanContext().isRemote` |
| `metadata`                  | Use attributes instead or set on scope           |
| `setContext()`              | Set context on scope instead                     |
| `setMeasurement()`          | `Sentry.setMeasurement()`                        |
| `setMetadata()`             | Use attributes instead or set on scope           |
| `getDynamicSamplingContext` | `getDynamicSamplingContextFromSpan(span)`        |

### Attributes vs. Data vs. Tags vs. Context

Previously, the model had the concepts of **Data**, **Tags**, and **Context**, which could be used for different things. However, this had two main downsides: Firstly, it was not always clear which concept should be used in a given situation. Secondly, these concepts were not displayed the same way for transactions or spans.

To address these issues, the new model only has **Attributes** that can be set on spans. Broadly speaking, they map to what was formerly known as Data.

If you still really _need_ to set tags or context, you can do so on the scope before starting a span:

```JavaScript
Sentry.withScope((scope) => {
  scope.setTag("my-tag", "tag-value");
  Sentry.startSpan({ name: "my-span" }, (span) => {
    // do something here
    // span will have the tags from the containing scope
  });
});
```

## Other Notable Changes

In addition to generally changing the performance APIs, there are also some smaller changes that this brings with it.

### Changed `SamplingContext` for `tracesSampler()`

Currently, `tracesSampler()` can receive an arbitrary `SamplingContext` passed as argument. While this is not defined
anywhere in detail, the shape of this context will change in v8. Going forward, this will mostly receive the attributes
of the span, as well as some other relevant data of the span. Some properties we used to (sometimes) pass there, like
`req` for node-based SDKs or `location` for browser tracing, will not be passed anymore.

### No more `undefined` spans

In v7, the performance APIs `startSpan()` / `startInactiveSpan()` / `startSpanManual()` would receive an `undefined`
span if tracing was disabled or the span was not sampled.

In v8, aligning with OpenTelemetry, these will _always_ return a span - _but_ the span may be a Noop-Span, meaning a
span that is never sent. This means you don't have to guard everywhere in your code anymore for the span to exist:

```TypeScript
Sentry.startSpan((span: Span | undefined) => {
  // previously, in order to be type safe, you had to use optional chaining or similar
  span?.setAttribute("attr", 1);
});

// In v8, the signature changes to:
Sentry.startSpan((span: Span) => {
  // no need to guard anymore!
  span.setAttribute("attr", 1);
});
```

### Forcing a sampling decision

Previously in v7, you could force a positive or negative sampling decision when calling `startTransaction` by setting the `sampled` option.
This would effectively override your <PlatformLink to="/configuration/sampling">sampling configuration</PlatformLink> for the specific transaction.
In v8, the `sampled` option was removed to align with OpenTelemetry. You can still force a decision by defining a
`tracesSampler` callback in `Sentry.init` and returning `1` or `0` for specific spans:

```JavaScript
// v7
Sentry.startTransition({op: 'function.myFunction', sampled: true});

// v8
// 1. define a tracesSampler
Sentry.init({
  tracesSampler: (samplingContext) => {
    // force a positive sampling decision for a specific span
    if (samplingContext.op === 'function.myFunction') {
      return 1;
    }
    // force a negative sampling decision for a specific span
    if (samplingContext.op === 'function.healthCheck') {
      return 0;
    }
    // return 0.1 as a default sample rate for all other spans
    return 0.1;
  }
});

// 2. start the span
Sentry.startSpan({op: 'function.myFunction'}, {/*...*/});
```
