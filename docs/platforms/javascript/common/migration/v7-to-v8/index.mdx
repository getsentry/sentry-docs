description: "Learn about migrating from Sentry JavaScript SDK 7.x to 8.x"
---

The main goal of version 8 is to improve our performance monitoring APIs, integrations API, and ESM support. This
version is breaking because we removed deprecated APIs, restructured npm package contents, and introduced new
dependencies on OpenTelemetry.

## Migration Codemod

Before updating to `8.x` of the SDK, we recommend upgrading to the latest version of `7.x`. To fix all deprecations on `7.x`, you can use the `@sentry/migr8` codemod to automatically update your SDK usage. `@sentry/migr8` requires Node 18+.

```bash
npx @sentry/migr8@latest
```

This will let you select which updates to run, and automatically update your code. Make sure to still review all code changes!

## Migration Guide

Please see our [detailed migration guide](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/develop/MIGRATION.md#upgrading-from-7x-to-8x) for more information on migrating from `7.x` to `8.x`.
