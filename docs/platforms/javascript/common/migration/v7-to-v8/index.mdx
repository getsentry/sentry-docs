The main goal of version 8 is to improve our performance monitoring APIs, integrations API, and ESM support. This
version is breaking because we removed deprecated APIs, restructured npm package contents, and introduced new
dependencies on OpenTelemetry.

## Migration Codemod

Before updating to `8.x` of the SDK, we recommend upgrading to the latest version of `7.x`. To fix most of the deprecations on `7.x`, you can use the [`@sentry/migr8`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/migr8) codemod to automatically update your SDK usage. `@sentry/migr8` requires Node 18+.

```bash
npx @sentry/migr8@latest
```

Our migration tool will let you select which updates to run, and automatically update your code. In some cases, we cannot automatically change code for you. These will be marked with a `TODO(sentry)` comment instead. Make sure to review all code changes after running `@sentry/migr8`! For more details on the deprecations, see our docs on [Deprecations in 7.x](./v7-deprecations).

## Migration Guide

Please see our [detailed migration guide](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/develop/MIGRATION.md#upgrading-from-7x-to-8x) for more information on migrating from `7.x` to `8.x`.

We recommend you read through all the [Important Changes](#important-changes) as they affect all Next.js SDK users. The [Other Changes](#other-changes) linked below only affect users who have more customized instrumentation. There is also a [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section for common issues.

### Deprecation of `Hub` and `getCurrentHub()`

The `Hub` has been a very important part of the Sentry SDK API up until now. Hubs were the SDK's "unit of concurrency" to keep track of data across threads and to scope data to certain parts of your code. Because it is overly complicated and confusing to power users, it is going to be replaced by a set of new APIs: the "new Scope API". For now `Hub` and `getCurrentHub` are still available, but it will be removed in the next major version.

As such, `@sentry/hub` has been removed and will no longer be published. All of the @sentry/hub exports have moved to `@sentry/core` or other related SDKs.
