The main goal of version 8 is to improve our performance monitoring APIs, integrations API, and ESM support. This
version is breaking because we removed deprecated APIs, restructured npm package contents, and introduced new
dependencies on OpenTelemetry.

## Migration Codemod

Before updating to `8.x` of the SDK, we recommend upgrading to the latest version of `7.x`. To fix most of the deprecations on `7.x`, you can use the [`@sentry/migr8`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/migr8) codemod to automatically update your SDK usage. `@sentry/migr8` requires Node 18+.

```bash
npx @sentry/migr8@latest
```

Our migration tool will let you select which updates to run, and automatically update your code. In some cases, we cannot automatically change code for you. These will be marked with a `TODO(sentry)` comment instead. Make sure to review all code changes after running `@sentry/migr8`! For more details on the deprecations, see our docs on [Deprecations in 7.x](./v7-deprecations). Despite having `@sentry/migr8`, we still recommend reading the migration guide, since `@sentry/migr8` does not cover all of the changes needed to migrate.

## Upgrading to `8.x`

We recommend you read through all the [Important Changes](#important-changes) as they affect all SDK users. The [Other Changes](#other-changes) linked below only affect users who have more customized instrumentation. There is also a [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section for common issues.

We also have a [detailed migration guide](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/develop/MIGRATION.md#upgrading-from-7x-to-8x) on GitHub, which has a comprehensive list of all changes alongside the source code of the SDK.

### New Performance Monitoring APIs

The Custom Instrumentation API for Performance Monitoring has been revamped in `8.x`. New methods have been introduced, and `startTransaction` and `span.startChild` has been removed. See the [new Performance Monitoring APIs docs](./v8-new-performance-api/) for more information.
