The main goal of version 8 is to improve our performance monitoring APIs, integrations API, and ESM support. This
version is breaking because we removed deprecated APIs, restructured npm package contents, and introduced new
dependencies on OpenTelemetry.

If you only use basic features of Sentry, or you simply copy & pasted the setup examples from our docs, here's what changed for you:

- If you installed additional Sentry packages, such as`@sentry/profiling-node` alongside your Sentry SDK (e.g. `@sentry/react` or `@sentry/node`), make sure to upgrade all of them to version 8. In addition, the `@sentry/hub`, `@sentry/tracing`, `@sentry/integrations`, `@sentry/serverless`, and `@sentry/replay` package have all been removed.

- Our SDKs now generate ES2018+ compatible code. This means we now only support Node 14.18 or higher and ES2018 compatible browsers. New minimum supported browsers:

  - Chrome 63
  - Edge 79
  - Safari/iOS Safari 12
  - Firefox 58
  - Opera 50
  - Samsung Internet 8.2

- Integrations are now functional instead of class based. For example, the import for session replay uses `Sentry.replayIntegration` instead of `new Sentry.Replay`.

- Initializing the Node SDK has been vastly simplified. You no longer need to use `autoDiscoverNodePerformanceMonitoringIntegrations` or use `Sentry.Handlers`, as these are now automatically included by the SDK without configuration. To make this work, you now have to ensure `Sentry.init` is initialized before any other code is imported and used.

```ts
// In v7, this was fine:
const Sentry = require("@sentry/node");
const express = require("express");

Sentry.init({
  // ...
});

const app = express();

// ...

// In v8, in order to ensure express is instrumented,
// you have to initialize before you import:
const Sentry = require("@sentry/node");
Sentry.init({
  // ...
});

const express = require("express");
const app = express();

Sentry.setupExpressErrorHandler(app);
```

Before updating to `8.x` of the SDK, we recommend upgrading to the latest version of `7.x`. To fix all deprecations on `7.x`, you can use the `@sentry/migr8` codemod to automatically update your SDK usage. `@sentry/migr8` requires Node 18+.

```bash
npx @sentry/migr8@latest
```

This will let you select which updates to run, and automatically update your code. Make sure to still review all code changes!
