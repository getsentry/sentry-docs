The v7 version of the JavaScript SDK requires a self-hosted version of Sentry `20.6.0` or higher.

The main goal of version 7 is to reduce bundle size. This version is breaking because we removed deprecated APIs,
upgraded our build tooling, and restructured npm package contents. Below we will outline all the breaking changes you
should consider when upgrading.

**TL;DR** If you only use basic features of Sentry, or you simply copy & pasted the setup examples from our docs, here's what changed for you:

- If you installed additional Sentry packages, such as `@sentry/tracing` alongside your Sentry SDK (e.g. `@sentry/react` or `@sentry/node`), make sure to upgrade all of them to version 7.
- Our CDN bundles are now ES6 - you will need to reconfigure your script tags if you want to
  keep supporting ES5 and IE11 on the new SDK version.
- Distributed CommonJS files will be ES6. Use a transpiler if you need to support old node versions.
- We bumped the TypeScript version we generate our types with to `3.8.3`. Please check if your TypeScript projects using TypeScript version `3.7` or lower still compile. Otherwise, upgrade your TypeScript version.
- `whitelistUrls` and `blacklistUrls` have been renamed to `allowUrls` and `denyUrls` in the `Sentry.init()` options.
- The `UserAgent` integration is now called `HttpContext`.
- If you are using Performance Monitoring and with tracing enabled, you might have to make adjustments to your server's CORS settings.

Please see our [detailed migration guide](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/develop/docs/migration/v6-to-v7.md) for more information on migrating from `6.x` to `7.x`.
