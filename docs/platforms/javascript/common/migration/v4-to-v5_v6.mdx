We recommend upgrading from `4.x` to `6.x` directly. Migrating from `5.x` to `6.x` has no breaking changes to the SDK's
API.

Please see our [detailed migration guide](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/develop/docs/migration/v4-to-v5_v6.md) for more information on migrating from `4.x` to `5.x`/`6.x`.
