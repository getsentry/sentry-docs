By default, Sentry error events will not get trace context unless you configure the scope with the transaction, as illustrated in the example below.

<Alert>

If you're adopting Profiling in a high-throughput environment, we recommend testing prior to deployment to ensure that your service's performance characteristics maintain expectations.

## Installation

Node profiling is available starting in `@sentry/profiling-node` version `0.3.0`.
You have to have the <PlatformSdkPackageName fallback="@sentry/node"/> (minimum version `7.44.1`) package installed.

## Enabling Profiling

To enable profiling, add `@sentry/profiling-node` to your imports and set up `nodeProfilingIntegration` in your Sentry config.

```javascript {diff}
const { nodeProfilingIntegration } = require("@sentry/profiling-node");

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    // Add our Profiling integration
+   nodeProfilingIntegration(),
  ],
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
+  // Set sampling rate for profiling - this is relative to tracesSampleRate
+  profilesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

// Profiling happens automatically after setting it up with `Sentry.init()`.
// All spans captured in your application will have profiling data attached to them.
// You can also manually capture spans with `startSpan`, as shown below:
Sentry.startSpan(
  {
    op: "rootSpan",
    name: "My root span",
  },
  () => {
    // Any code in this callback will be profiled.
  }
);
```

## How Does It Work?

Under the hood, the Sentry profiler uses V8's [CpuProfiler](https://v8docs.nodesource.com/node-18.2/d2/d34/classv8_1_1_cpu_profiler.html) to collect stack samples. This means that `sentry/profiling-node` is written as a [native add-on](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/addons.html) for Node and won't run in environments like Deno or Bun. Profiling enhances tracing by providing profiles for individual transactions. This allows you to look at higher level performance information like transaction and span durations before diving deeper and looking at profiles.

## Precompiled Binaries

Starting from version `0.1.0`, the `@sentry/profiling-node` package precompiles binaries for a number of common architectures. This minimizes the tooling required to run the package and avoids compiling the package from source in most cases, which speeds up installation. Currently, we ship prebuilt binaries for the following architectures and Node versions:

- macOS x64: Node v16, v18, v20, v22
- Linux ARM64 (musl): Node v16, v18, v20, v22
- Linux x64 (glibc): Node v16, v18, v20, v22
- Windows x64: Node v16, v18, v20, v22

The set of common architectures should cover a wide variety of use cases, but if you have feedback or experience different behavior, please open an issue in the [Sentry JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript) repository.
