You can use the Angular CLI together with our Sentry webpack plugin to automatically create releases and upload source maps to Sentry when building your app (with `ng build`, for example).
Due to Angular's closed build system, to register the webpack plugin, you'll first need to configure a custom builder.
In the end, you'll be able to automatically upload source maps whenever you're creating a production build of your app.

<Alert level="warning">

Before you start configuring the source maps upload, make sure that you're [generating source maps](../../.#generating-source-maps) in your Angular project.

  </Alert>

## Install

Install the custom webpack builder for Angular and the Sentry webpack plugin:

```shell {tabTitle:npm}
npm install @angular-builders/custom-webpack @sentry/webpack-plugin --save-dev
```

```shell {tabTitle:yarn}
yarn add @angular-builders/custom-webpack @sentry/webpack-plugin --dev
```

```shell {tabTitle:pnpm}
pnpm add @angular-builders/custom-webpack @sentry/webpack-plugin --save-dev
```

## Configure

With these packages installed, configure your app to upload source maps in three steps:

### 1. Set up custom Angular builder

In your `angular.json`, replace the default builder (`@angular-devkit/build-angular`) with `@angular-builders/custom-webpack`:

```javascript {filename:angular.json}
{
  "projects": {
    "my-project": {
      "architect": {
        "build": {
          "builder": "@angular-builders/custom-webpack:browser",
          "options": {
            "customWebpackConfig": {
              "path": "./webpack.config.js"
            },
            // ... other options
          },
          // ... other options
        },
        // ... other options
      },
      // ... other options
    }
  }
}
```

<Alert>

This configuration has no effect on your development server if you're running `ng serve`.
Only `ng build` is configured to use the custom builder and the Webpack plugin.
If you're using an Angular version below 13, only `ng build --prod` will leverage the custom builder.

</Alert>

### 2. Register the Sentry Webpack Plugin

<Note>

This guide assumes you are using a Sentry SDK on version `7.47.0` or higher.

If you are on an older version and you want to upload source maps we recommend upgrading your SDK to the newest version.

</Note>

To upload source maps you have to configure an auth token.
Auth tokens can be passed to the plugin explicitly with the `authToken` option, with a `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable, or with an `.env.sentry-build-plugin` file in the working directory when building your project.
We recommend you add the auth token to your CI/CD environment as an environment variable.

<OrgAuthTokenNote />

```bash {filename:.env.sentry-build-plugin}
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=___ORG_AUTH_TOKEN___
```

Register the Sentry Webpack plugin in your `webpack.config.js`:

<SignInNote />

```javascript {filename:webpack.config.js}
const { sentryWebpackPlugin } = require("@sentry/webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  // ... other config above ...

  devtool: "source-map", // Source map generation must be turned on
  plugins: [
    sentryWebpackPlugin({
      org: "___ORG_SLUG___",
      project: "___PROJECT_SLUG___",
      authToken: process.env.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN,
    }),
  ],
};
```

Learn more about configuring the plugin in our [Sentry webpack plugin documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/webpack-plugin).

### 3. Upload

To upload the source maps, build your Angular application:

```bash
ng build # add --prod for Angular versions below 13
```

<Note>

The Sentry webpack plugin doesn't upload source maps in watch-mode/development-mode.
We recommend running a production build to test your implementation.
