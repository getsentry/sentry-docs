<Note>

This guide assumes you're using a **Sentry SDK version `7.47.0` or higher**. If you're on an older version and you want to upload source maps, we recommend upgrading your SDK to the newest version.

</Note>

You can use the Sentry Rollup plugin to automatically create releases and upload source maps to Sentry when bundling your app.

## Automatic Setup

The easiest way to configure source map uploading with rollup is by using the Sentry Wizard:

<Include name="sourcemaps-wizard-instructions.mdx" />

If you'd rather manually configure source map uploading with the CLI, follow the steps below.

## Manual Setup

Install the Sentry Rollup plugin:

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install @sentry/rollup-plugin --save-dev
```

```bash {tabTitle:yarn}
yarn add @sentry/rollup-plugin --dev
```

```bash {tabTitle:pnpm}
pnpm add @sentry/rollup-plugin --save-dev
```

### Configuration

To upload source maps you have to configure an auth token.
Auth tokens can be passed to the plugin explicitly with the `authToken` option, with a `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable, or with an `.env.sentry-build-plugin` file in the working directory when building your project.
We recommend you add the auth token to your CI/CD environment as an environment variable.

Learn more about configuring the plugin in our [Sentry Rollup Plugin documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/rollup-plugin).

<OrgAuthTokenNote />

```bash {filename:.env.sentry-build-plugin}
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=___ORG_AUTH_TOKEN___
```

Example:

<SignInNote />

```javascript {filename:rollup.config.js}
import { sentryRollupPlugin } from "@sentry/rollup-plugin";

export default {
  output: {
    sourcemap: true, // Source map generation must be turned on
  },
  plugins: [
    // Put the Sentry rollup plugin after all other plugins
    sentryRollupPlugin({
      org: "___ORG_SLUG___",
      project: "___PROJECT_SLUG___",
      authToken: process.env.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN,
    }),
  ],
};
```

<Alert>
  Generating sourcemaps may expose them to the public, potentially causing your
  source code to be leaked. You can prevent this by configuring your server to deny access to `.js.map` files, or by
  using [Sentry Rollup Plugin's
  `sourcemaps.filesToDeleteAfterUpload`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/rollup-plugin#sourcemapsfilestodeleteafterupload)
  option to delete source maps after they've been uploaded to Sentry.
