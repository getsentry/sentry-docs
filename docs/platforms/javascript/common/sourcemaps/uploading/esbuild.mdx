<Alert>

This guide assumes you're using a Sentry **SDK version `7.47.0` or higher**. If you're on an older version and you want to upload source maps, we recommend upgrading your SDK to the newest version.

<Alert level="warning">

The Sentry esbuild plugin doesn't fully support esbuild configurations with `splitting: true`.
If you rely on code splitting, use the esbuild plugin with <PlatformLink to="/sourcemaps/troubleshooting_js/legacy-uploading-methods/#uploading-using-sentry-bundler-plugins-on-version-2x">legacy source maps upload</PlatformLink>
or <PlatformLink to="/sourcemaps/uploading/cli/">Sentry CLI</PlatformLink> to upload source maps instead.

You can use the Sentry esbuild plugin to automatically create releases and upload source maps to Sentry when bundling your app.

## Automatic Setup

The easiest way to configure source map uploading with esbuild is by using the Sentry Wizard:

<Include name="sourcemaps-wizard-instructions.mdx" />

If you want to configure source map uploading with esbuild manually, follow the steps below.

## Manual Setup

Install the Sentry esbuild plugin:

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install @sentry/esbuild-plugin --save-dev
```

```bash {tabTitle:yarn}
yarn add @sentry/esbuild-plugin --dev
```

```bash {tabTitle:pnpm}
pnpm add @sentry/esbuild-plugin --save-dev
```

### Configure

To upload source maps you have to configure an [Organization Auth Token](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/settings/auth-tokens/).

Alternatively, you can also use a [User Auth Token](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/), with the "Project: Read & Write" and "Release: Admin" permissions.

Auth tokens can be passed to the plugin explicitly with the `authToken` option, with a `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable, or with an `.env.sentry-build-plugin` file (don't forget to add it to your `.gitignore` file, as this is sensitive data) in the working directory when building your project.
We recommend you add the auth token to your CI/CD environment as an environment variable.

Learn more about configuring the plugin in our [Sentry esbuild Plugin documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/esbuild-plugin).

<OrgAuthTokenNote />

```bash {filename:.env.sentry-build-plugin}
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=___ORG_AUTH_TOKEN___
```

Example:

```javascript {filename:esbuild.config.js}
const { sentryEsbuildPlugin } = require("@sentry/esbuild-plugin");

require("esbuild").build({
  sourcemap: true, // Source map generation must be turned on
  plugins: [
    // Put the Sentry esbuild plugin after all other plugins
    sentryEsbuildPlugin({
      org: "___ORG_SLUG___",
      project: "___PROJECT_SLUG___",
      authToken: process.env.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN,
    }),
  ],
});
```

<Alert>
  Generating sourcemaps may expose them to the public, potentially causing your
  source code to be leaked. You can prevent this by configuring your server to
  deny access to `.js.map` files, or by using [Sentry Esbuild Plugin's
  `sourcemaps.filesToDeleteAfterUpload`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/esbuild-plugin#sourcemapsfilestodeleteafterupload)
  option to delete source maps after they've been uploaded to Sentry.
</Alert>

<Alert>

The Sentry esbuild plugin doesn't upload source maps in watch-mode/development-mode.
We recommend running a production build to test your configuration.
