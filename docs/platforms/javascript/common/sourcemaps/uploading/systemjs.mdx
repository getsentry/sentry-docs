In this guide, you'll learn how to successfully upload source maps for SystemJS using our `sentry-cli` tool.

### 1. Generate Source Maps

First, configure SystemJS to output source maps:

```
builder.bundle("src/app.js", "dist/app.min.js", {
  minify: true,
  sourceMaps: true,
  sourceMapContents: true,
});
```

<Alert>
Generating sourcemaps may expose them to the public, potentially causing your source code to be leaked. You can prevent this by configuring your server to deny access to `.js.map` files, or by deleting the sourcemaps before deploying your application.
