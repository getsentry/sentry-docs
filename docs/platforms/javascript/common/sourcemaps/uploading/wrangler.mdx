<Alert level="info">

This guide is specifically for Cloudflare Workers using Wrangler. For other build tools like Vite with Cloudflare, use the corresponding Vite guide instead.

We recommend using Vite to build your worker for an easier and more reliable setup. Learn more about [Cloudflare's Vite setup](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/vite-plugin/get-started/).

## Automatic Setup

The easiest way to configure source map uploading with Wrangler is by using the Sentry Wizard:

<Include name="sourcemaps-wizard-instructions.mdx" />

The wizard will guide you through the following steps:

- Logging into Sentry and selecting a project
- Installing the necessary Sentry packages
- Modifying your deploy command to access source maps and inject the `SENTRY_RELEASE` environment variable
- Creating a source map upload script
- Configuring your CI to upload source maps

If you'd rather configure source maps manually, follow the steps below.

## Manual Setup

### 1. Install Sentry CLI

First, install Sentry CLI as a dev dependency:

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install --save-dev @sentry/cli
```

```bash {tabTitle:yarn}
yarn add --dev @sentry/cli
```

```bash {tabTitle:pnpm}
pnpm add --save-dev @sentry/cli
```

### 2. Configure Sentry CLI

For more info on `sentry-cli` configuration visit the [Sentry CLI configuration docs](/cli/configuration/).

Make sure `sentry-cli` is configured for your project. For that you can use environment variables:

```bash {filename:.env.local}
SENTRY_ORG=example-org
SENTRY_PROJECT=example-project
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=sntrys_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

### 3. Modify Your Deploy Script

Update your Wrangler deploy script in `package.json` to include the necessary flags for source map generation and upload:

```json {filename:package.json}
{
  "scripts": {
    "deploy": "wrangler deploy --outdir dist --upload-source-maps --var SENTRY_RELEASE:$(sentry-cli releases propose-version)"
  }
}
```

The key flags are:

- `--outdir dist`: Specifies the output directory where source maps will be generated
- `--upload-source-maps`: Forces Wrangler to generate source maps
- `--var SENTRY_RELEASE:$(sentry-cli releases propose-version)`: Injects the release version as an environment variable

### 4. Create a Source Map Upload Script

Add a script to upload source maps to Sentry in your `package.json`:

```json {filename:package.json}
{
  "scripts": {
    "sentry:sourcemaps": "_SENTRY_RELEASE=$(sentry-cli releases propose-version) && sentry-cli releases new $_SENTRY_RELEASE --org=your-org --project=your-project && sentry-cli sourcemaps upload --org=your-org --project=your-project --release=$_SENTRY_RELEASE --strip-prefix 'dist/..' dist"
  }
}
```

Replace `your-org` and `your-project` with your actual Sentry organization and project slugs.

### 5. Add a Post-Deploy Hook

Create a post-deploy script that automatically uploads source maps after deployment:

```json {filename:package.json}
{
  "scripts": {
    "deploy": "wrangler deploy --outdir dist --upload-source-maps --var SENTRY_RELEASE:$(sentry-cli releases propose-version)",
    "postdeploy": "npm run sentry:sourcemaps"
  }
}
```

This ensures that source maps are uploaded to Sentry immediately after a successful deployment.

### 6. Configure Your Sentry SDK

Make sure your Sentry SDK configuration includes the release information:

```typescript {filename:index.ts}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/cloudflare";

export default Sentry.withSentry(
  (env: Env) => ({
    dsn: "YOUR_DSN_HERE",
    // The release name should match what's used during source map upload
    release: env.SENTRY_RELEASE,
    // other options...
  }),
  {
    async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
      // Your worker logic here
      return new Response("Hello World!");
    },
  } satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>
);
```

### 7. Deploy Your Application

Run your deploy command:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will:

1. Build your worker with source maps enabled
2. Deploy to Cloudflare with the release version injected
3. Automatically upload source maps to Sentry via the post-deploy hook

### 8. Verify Source Maps Upload

You can verify that your source maps were uploaded successfully by:

1. Going to **Project Settings > Source Maps** in Sentry
2. Checking for your release in the "Artifact Bundles" tab
3. Confirming that source maps are working by triggering an error and checking that the stack trace shows your original source code

## Troubleshooting

### Source Maps Not Working

If your source maps aren't working as expected:

1. Verify that the `SENTRY_RELEASE` environment variable is being set correctly in your worker
2. Check that the release name in your Sentry SDK configuration matches the one used during upload
3. Ensure that source maps are being generated in the specified `--outdir`

### Build Errors

If you encounter build errors when adding source map flags:

1. Make sure you're using a recent version of Wrangler
2. Verify that your project structure supports the `--outdir` flag
3. Consider switching to Vite for a more robust build pipeline
