In this guide, you'll learn how to successfully upload source maps for TypeScript using our `sentry-cli` tool.

<Include name="debug-id-requirement.mdx" />

<Alert>

This guide is only applicable if you're using the command `ionic capacitor build` to compile your project. If you use another command, you'll most likely want to follow that guide instead.

</Alert>

## Automatic Setup

You can use the Sentry Wizard to give you an initial setup, but manual changes will still be required in order to set up source maps
for this build setup.

<Include name="sourcemaps-wizard-instructions.mdx" />

## Manual Setup

### 1. Generate Source Maps

First, configure the TypeScript compiler to output source maps:

```json {filename:tsconfig.json}
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "sourceMap": true,
    "inlineSources": true,

    // Set `sourceRoot` to  "/" to strip the build path prefix from
    // generated source code references. This will improve issue grouping in Sentry.
    "sourceRoot": "/"
  }
}
```

<Alert>
Generating source maps may expose them to the public, potentially causing your source code to be leaked. You can prevent this by configuring your server to deny access to `.js.map` files, or by deleting the source maps before deploying your application.
</Alert>

### 2. Configure Sentry CLI

<Alert>

See the [installation instructions for Sentry CLI](/cli/installation/).

For more info on `sentry-cli` configuration visit the [Sentry CLI configuration docs](/cli/configuration/).

</Alert>

Make sure `sentry-cli` is configured for your project. For that you can use environment variables:

<OrgAuthTokenNote />

```bash {filename:.env.local}
SENTRY_ORG=___ORG_SLUG___
SENTRY_PROJECT=___PROJECT_SLUG___
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=___ORG_AUTH_TOKEN___
```

### 3. Inject Debug IDs Into Artifacts

Debug IDs are used to match the stack frame of an event with its corresponding minified source and source map file. Visit [What are Debug IDs](/platforms/javascript/sourcemaps/troubleshooting_js/debug-ids/) to learn more.

To inject Debug IDs, use the following command after you build your project:

```bash
// Paths can vary so check where your assets/public and App/public folder are.
sentry-cli sourcemaps inject /path/to/directory/android/app/src/main/assets/public
sentry-cli sourcemaps inject /path/to/directory/ios/App/public
```

#### Verify Debug IDs Were Injected in Artifacts

At the end of minified source files, you should include a comment named `debugId`, like this:

```javascript {filename:example_minified_file.js}
...
//# debugId=<debug_id>
//# sourceMappingURL=<sourcemap_url>
```

Source maps should also contain a field named `debug_id`:

```json {filename:example_source_map.js.map}
{
    ...
    "debug_id":"<debug_id>",
    ...
}
```

### 4. Upload Artifact Bundle

After you've injected Debug IDs into your artifacts, upload them using the following command:

```bash
// Paths can vary so check where your assets/public and App/public folder are.
sentry-cli sourcemaps upload /path/to/directory/android/app/src/main/assets/public
sentry-cli sourcemaps upload /path/to/directory/ios/App/public

```

#### Verify That Artifact Bundles Were Uploaded

Open up Sentry and navigate to **Project Settings > Source Maps**. If you choose “Artifact Bundles” in the tabbed navigation, you'll see all the artifact bundles that have been successfully uploaded to Sentry.

### 5. Deploy Your Application

If you're following this guide from your local machine, then you've successfully:

1. Generated minified source and source map files (artifacts) by running your application's build process
2. Injected Debug IDs into the artifacts you've just generated
3. Uploaded those artifacts to Sentry with our upload command

The last step is deploying a new version of your application using the generated artifacts you created in step one. **We strongly recommend that you integrate `sentry-cli` into your CI/CD Pipeline**, to ensure each subsequent deploy will automatically inject debug IDs into each artifact and upload them directly to Sentry.

### Optional Steps

<Alert title="Warning">

Only follow these optional steps if you have concluded that you absolutely need them.
Using `release` and `dist` values will make your artifact upload more specific, but will also make the entire process less forgiving, which may lead to your code not being unminified by Sentry.

</Alert>

#### Associating `release` With Artifact Bundle

Provide a `release` property in your SDK options.

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  // This value must be identical to the release name specified during upload
  // with the `sentry-cli`.
  release: "<release_name>",
});
```

Afterwards, run the `sourcemaps upload` command with the additional `--release` option. Please ensure that the value specified for `<release_name>` is the same value specified in your SDK options.

```bash
// Paths can vary so check where your assets/public and App/public folder are.
sentry-cli sourcemaps upload --release=<release_name> /path/to/directory/android/app/src/main/assets/public
sentry-cli sourcemaps upload --release=<release_name> /path/to/directory/ios/App/public
```

<Alert>

Running `upload` with `--release` **doesn't automatically create a release in Sentry**.
Either wait until the first event with the new release set in `Sentry.init` is sent to Sentry, or create a release with the same name in a separate step [with the CLI](/cli/releases).

</Alert>

#### Associating `dist` With Your Artifact Bundle

In addition to `release`, you can also add a `dist` to your uploaded artifacts to set the distribution identifier for uploaded files. To do so, run the `sourcemaps upload` command with the additional `--dist` option.

Provide `release` and `dist` properties in your SDK options.

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  // These values must be identical to the release and dist names specified during upload
  // with the `sentry-cli`.
  release: "<release_name>",
  dist: "<dist_name>",
});
```

The distribution identifier is used to distinguish between multiple files of the same name within a single release. `dist` can be used to disambiguate build or deployment variants.

```bash

// Paths can vary so check where your assets/public and App/public folder are.
sentry-cli sourcemaps upload --release=<release_name> --dist=<dist_name> /path/to/directory/android/app/src/main/assets/public
sentry-cli sourcemaps upload --release=<release_name> --dist=<dist_name> /path/to/directory/ios/App/public
```

## Dealing With TSLib

During compilation, TypeScript will inject some of its runtime dependencies into the output files it produces if needed. It can include things like polyfills for function generators or APIs that may not be available in all the environments. However, the fact that there aren't any original sources makes it impossible to map frames from compiled code to the original sources.

As a workaround, you'll need to tell the TypeScript compiler to use `tslib`, its own 3rd party package, (which is internally the part of a compiler) instead of injecting runtime dependencies. You'll only need to change what's inside the TypeScript config file, not your source code. Here's how:

1. Make sure that `tslib` is listed as a dependency in your `package.json` file.
2. Once that's done, add two entries in the `compilerOptions` section of your `tsconfig.json`:
- `"noEmitHelpers": true` and
-`"importHelpers": true`.

That's it! Now you should be able to correctly map the source maps for all your stack trace frames, including internal TypeScript compiler code snippets.
