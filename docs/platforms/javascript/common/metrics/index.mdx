With [Sentry Metrics](/product/explore/metrics/), you can send counters, gauges, and distributions from your applications to Sentry. Once in Sentry, these metrics can be viewed alongside relevant errors, and searched using their individual attributes.

  [GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/discussions/102275) if you have
