          {
            name: "level",
            type: '"fatal" | "error" | "warning" | "log" | "info" | "debug"',

          {
            name: "category",
            type: "string",
            description:
              "Typically it is a module name or a descriptive string. For instance, `ui.click` could be used to indicate that a click happened",
          },
          {
            name: "data",
            type: "Record<string, unknown>",
            description:
              "Additional data that should be sent with the breadcrumb.",
          },
        ],
      },
    },
    {
      name: "hint",
      type: "Record<string, unknown>",
      description:
        "A hint object containing additional information about the breadcrumb.",
    },
  ]}

  You can manually add breadcrumbs whenever something interesting happens. For
  example, you might manually record a breadcrumb if the user authenticates or
  another state change occurs.
