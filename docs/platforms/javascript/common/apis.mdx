This page shows all available top-level APIs of the SDK. You can use these APIs as the primary way to:

- Configure the SDK after initialization
- Manually capture different types of events
- Enrich events with additional data
- ... and more!

These APIs are functions that you can use as follows - they are all available on the top-level `Sentry` object:

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";

Sentry.setTag("tag", "value");
```

## Available APIs

<TableOfContents ignoreIds={["available-apis"]} />

## Core APIs

<SdkApi
  name="init"
  signature="function init(options: InitOptions): Client | undefined"
>
  Initialize the SDK with the given options. See{" "}
  <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/">Options</PlatformLink> for the
  options you can pass to `init`.
</SdkApi>

<SdkApi name="getClient" signature="function getClient(): Client | undefined">
  Returns the currently active client.
</SdkApi>

<SdkApi
  name="setCurrentClient"
  signature="function setCurrentClient(client: Client): void"
>
  Make the given client the current client. You do not need this if you use
  `init()`, this is only necessary if you are manually setting up a client.
</SdkApi>

<SdkApi
  name="lastEventId"
  signature="function lastEventId(): string | undefined"
>
  Returns the ID of the last sent error event. Note that this does not guarantee
  that this event ID exists, as it may have been dropped along the way.
</SdkApi>

<SdkApi
  name="flush"
  signature="function flush(timeout?: number): Promise<boolean>"
  parameters={[
    {
      name: "timeout",
      type: "number",
      description:
        "Maximum time in ms the client should wait to flush its event queue. Omitting this parameter will cause the client to wait until all events are sent before resolving the promise.",
    },
  ]}
>
  Flushes all pending events.
</SdkApi>

<SdkApi name="isEnabled" signature="function isEnabled(): boolean">
  Returns true if the SDK is initialized & enabled.
</SdkApi>

<SdkApi
  name="close"
  signature="function close(timeout?: number): Promise<boolean>"
  parameters={[
    {
      name: "timeout",
      type: "number",
      description:
        "Maximum time in ms the client should wait to flush its event queue. Omitting this parameter will cause the client to wait until all events are sent before resolving the promise.",
    },
  ]}
>
Flushes all pending events and disables the SDK. Note that this does not
remove any listeners the SDK may have set up. After a call to `close`, the current client cannot be used anymore. It's
important to only call `close` immediately before shutting down the application.

Alternatively, the [`flush`](#flush) method drains the event queue while keeping the
client enabled for continued use.

</SdkApi>

<SdkApi
  name="addEventProcessor"
  signature="function addEventProcessor(processor: EventProcessor): void"
  parameters={[
    {
      name: "processor",
      type: "(event: Event, hint: EventHint) => Event | null | Promise<Event | null>",
    },
  ]}
>
  Adds an event processor to the SDK. An event processor receives every event
  before it is sent to Sentry. It can either mutate the event (and return it) or
  return `null` to discard the event. Event processors can also return a
  promise, but it is recommended to use this only when necessary as it slows
  down event processing.

<PlatformCategorySection notSupported={["server", "serverless"]}>
  Event processors added via `Sentry.addEventProcessor()` will be applied to all
  events in your application. If you want to add an event processor that only
  applies to certain events, you can also add one to a scope as follows:
</PlatformCategorySection>

    <PlatformCategorySection supported={['server', 'serverless']}>
    Event processors added via `Sentry.addEventProcessor()` will be applied to all events in your current request.

If you want to add an event processor that only applies to certain events, you can also add one to a scope as follows:

  </PlatformCategorySection>

```javascript
Sentry.withScope((scope) => {
  scope.addEventProcessor((event) => {
    // this will only be applied to events captured within this scope
    return event;
  });

  Sentry.captureException(new Error("test"));
});
```

  <Expandable title='What is the difference to `beforeSend` / `beforeSendTransaction`?'>
    `beforeSend` and `beforeSendTransaction` are guaranteed to be run last, after all other event processors, (which means they get the final version of the event right before it's sent, hence the name). Event processors added with `addEventProcessor` are run in an undetermined order, which means changes to the event may still be made after the event processor runs.

    There can only be a single `beforeSend` / `beforeSendTransaction` processor, but you can add multiple event processors via `addEventProcessor()`.

  </Expandable>
</SdkApi>

<SdkApi
  name="addIntegration"
  signature="function addIntegration(integration: Integration): void"
>
Adds an integration to the SDK. This can be used to conditionally add
integrations after `Sentry.init()` has been called. Note that it is
recommended to pass integrations to `init` instead of calling this method,
where possible.

See <PlatformLink to="/configuration/integrations">Integrations</PlatformLink> for
more information on how to use integrations.

</SdkApi>

<SdkApi name="lazyLoadIntegration" signature="function lazyLoadIntegration(name: string, scriptNonce?: string): Promise<Integration>" categorySupported={['browser']}>
  Lazy load an integration. This expects the name to be e.g. `replayIntegration`. It will load the script from the CDN, and return a promise that resolves to the integration, which can then be added to the SDK using `addIntegration`:

```javascript
Sentry.lazyLoadIntegration("replayIntegration")
  .then((integration) => {
    Sentry.addIntegration(integration);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // Make sure to handle errors here!
    // This rejects e.g. if the CDN bundle cannot be loaded
  });
```

If you use a bundler, using e.g. `const { replayIntegration } = await import('@sentry/browser')` is recommended instead.

See <PlatformLink to="/configuration/integrations">Integrations</PlatformLink> for
more information on how to use integrations.

        name: "CaptureContext",
        properties: [
          {
            name: "user",
            type: {
              name: "User",

        ],
      },
      description: "Optional additional data to attach to the Sentry event.",
    },
  ]}
>
  Capture an exception event and send it to Sentry. Note that you can pass not
  only `Error` objects, but also other objects as `exception` - in that case,
  the SDK will attempt to serialize the object for you, and the stack trace will
  be generated by the SDK and may be less accurate.
</SdkApi>

<SdkApi

Capture a message event and send it to Sentry. Optionally, instead of a
`CaptureContext`, you can also pass a `SeverityLevel` as second argument, e.g.
`"error"` or `"warning"`.

Messages show up as issues on your issue stream, with the message as the issue name.

## Enriching Events

<SdkApi
  name="setTag"
  signature="function setTag(key: string, value: string): void"
  parameters={[]}
>
  Set a tag to be sent with Sentry events.
</SdkApi>

<SdkApi
  name="setTags"
  signature="function setTags(tags: Record<string, string>): void"
  parameters={[]}
>
  Set multiple tags to be sent with Sentry events.
</SdkApi>

<SdkApi
  name="setContext"
  signature="function setContext(name: string, context: Record<string, unknown>): void"
  parameters={[]}
>
  Set a context to be sent with Sentry events. Custom contexts allow you to attach arbitrary data to an event.
  You cannot search these, but they are viewable on the issue page - if you
  need to be able to filter for certain data, use [tags](./#setTag) instead.

  There are no restrictions on context name. In the context object, all keys are allowed except for `type`, which is used internally.

By default, Sentry SDKs normalize nested structured context data up to three levels deep.
Any data beyond this depth will be trimmed and marked using its type instead.
To adjust this default, use the <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options#normalize-depth">`normalizeDepth`</PlatformLink> SDK option.

Learn more about conventions for common contexts in the [contexts interface developer documentation](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/data-model/event-payloads/contexts/).

 <Expandable title='Example'>
  Context data is structured and can contain any data you want:

  ```javascript
  Sentry.setContext("character", {
    name: "Mighty Fighter",
    age: 19,
    attack_type: "melee",
  });
  ```
  </Expandable>

</SdkApi>

<SdkApi
  name="setExtra"
  signature="function setExtra(name: string, extra: unknown): void"
  parameters={[]}
>
  Set additional data to be sent with Sentry events.
</SdkApi>

<SdkApi
  name="setExtras"
  signature="function setExtras(extras: Record<string, unknown>): void"
  parameters={[]}
>
  Set multiple additional data entries to be sent with Sentry events.
</SdkApi>

<SdkApi
  name="setUser"
  signature="function setUser(user: User | null): void"
  parameters={[
    {
      name: "user",
      type: {
        name: "User",
        properties: [
          {
            name: "id",
            type: "string | number",
            description: "Your internal identifier for the user",
          },
          {
            name: "email",
            type: "string",
            description:
              "Sentry is aware of email addresses and can display things such as Gravatars and unlock messaging capabilities",
          },
          {
            name: "username",
            type: "string",
            description:
              "Typically used as a better label than the internal id",
          },
          {
            name: "ip_address",
            type: "string",
            description:
              "The user's IP address. If the user is unauthenticated, Sentry uses the IP address as a unique identifier for the user",
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  ]}
>
  Set a user to be sent with Sentry events. Set to `null` to unset the user. In
  addition to the specified properties of the `User` object, you can also add
  additional arbitrary key/value pairs.

  <Expandable title="Capturing User IP-Addresses">
    <PlatformCategorySection supported={['server', 'serverless']}>
    On the server, the IP address will be inferred from the incoming HTTP request, if available.
    This is automatically done if you have configured `sendDefaultPii: true` in your <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#sendDefaultPii">SDK configuration</PlatformLink>.
    </PlatformCategorySection>

    <PlatformCategorySection supported={["browser"]}>
    On the browser, if the users' `ip_address` is set to `"{{ auto }}"`, Sentry
    will infer the IP address from the connection between your app and Sentrys'
    server. `{{auto}}` is automatically set if you have configured `sendDefaultPii:
    true` in your <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#sendDefaultPii">SDK configuration</PlatformLink>.
    </PlatformCategorySection>

    To ensure your users' IP addresses are never stored in your event data, you can go to your project settings, click on "Security & Privacy", and enable "Prevent Storing of IP Addresses" or use Sentry's [server-side data scrubbing](/security-legal-pii/scrubbing/) to remove `$user.ip_address`. Adding such a rule ultimately overrules any other logic.

    <PlatformSection notSupported={['javascript.bun', 'javascript.cloudflare', 'javascript.deno', 'javascript.react-router', 'javascript.aws-lambda', 'javascript.azure-functions', 'javascript.gcp-functions']}>
    `Sentry.setUser()` will set the user for the currently active request - see <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/request-isolation">Request Isolation</PlatformLink> for more information. For example, if you want to set the user for a single request, you can do this like this:
    </PlatformSection>
    <PlatformContent includePath="enriching-events/set-user-request" />

    Or if you want to set the user for all requests, you could use a middleware like this:

  You can manually add breadcrumbs whenever something interesting happens. For
  example, you might manually record a breadcrumb if the user authenticates or
  another state change occurs.

  Start an pageload span that will be automatically ended when the page is

  automatically be ended first. In most cases, you do not need to call this, as
  the `browserTracingIntegration` will automatically do that for you. However,
  if you opt-out of pageload spans, you can use this method to manually start
  such a span. Please note that this function will do nothing if
  `browserTracingIntegration` has not been enabled.

## Tracing Utilities

These utilities can be used for more advanced tracing use cases.

<SdkApi name="spanToJSON" signature="function spanToJSON(span: Span): SpanJSON">
  Convert a span to a JSON object.
</SdkApi>

<SdkApi
  name="updateSpanName"
  signature="function updateSpanName(span: Span, name: string): void"
>
  Update the name of a span. Use this over `span.updateName(name)` to ensure
  that the span is updated in all backends.
</SdkApi>

<SdkApi
  name="getActiveSpan"
  signature="function getActiveSpan(): Span | undefined"
>
  Get the currently active span.
</SdkApi>

<SdkApi name="getRootSpan" signature="function getRootSpan(span: Span): Span">
  Get the root span of a span.
</SdkApi>

<SdkApi
  name="withActiveSpan"
  signature="function withActiveSpan<T>(span: Span | null, callback: () => T): T"
>
  Runs the provided callback with the given span as the active span. If `null`
  is provided, the callback will have no active span.
</SdkApi>

## Sessions

Sessions allow you to track the release health of your application.
See the <PlatformLink to="/configuration/releases/#sessions">Releases & Health</PlatformLink> page for more information.

<SdkApi name="startSession" signature="function startSession(): void">
  Starts a new session.
</SdkApi>

<SdkApi name="endSession" signature="function endSession(): void">
  Ends the current session (but does not send it to Sentry).
</SdkApi>

<SdkApi
  name="captureSession"
  signature="function captureSession(end = false): void"
>
  Sends the current session on the scope to Sentry. Pass `true` as argument to
  end the session first.
</SdkApi>

## Scopes

See <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/scopes/">Scopes</PlatformLink> for more information on how to use scopes,
as well as for an explanation of the different types of scopes (current scope, isolation scope, and global scope).

<SdkApi
  name="withScope"
  signature="function withScope(callback: (scope: Scope) => void): void"
>
  Forks the current scope and calls the callback with the forked scope.
</SdkApi>

<SdkApi
  name="withIsolationScope"
  signature="function withIsolationScope(callback: (scope: Scope) => void): void"
>
  Forks the current isolation scope and calls the callback with the forked
  scope.
</SdkApi>

<SdkApi name="getCurrentScope" signature="function getCurrentScope(): Scope">
  Returns the <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/scopes/#current-scope">current scope</PlatformLink>.

Note that in most cases you should not use this API, but instead use `withScope` to generate and access a local scope. There are no guarantees about the consistency of `getCurrentScope` across different parts of your application, as scope forking may happen under the hood at various points.

</SdkApi>

<SdkApi
  name="getIsolationScope"
  signature="function getIsolationScope(): Scope"
>
  Returns the current{" "}
  <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/scopes/#isolation-scope">
    isolation scope
  </PlatformLink>
  .
</SdkApi>

<SdkApi name="getGlobalScope" signature="function getGlobalScope(): Scope">
