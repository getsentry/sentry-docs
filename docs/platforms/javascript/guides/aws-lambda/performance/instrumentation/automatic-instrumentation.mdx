When performance is enabled through `tracesSampleRate`, `enableTracing` or a `tracesSampler` function, the Sentry SDK will automatically capture spans for the following:

- HTTP requests made with:
  - `http`
  - `https`
  - `fetch`

These are automatically set up for you without any further configuration.

The following instrumentation can be manually enabled by adding the corresponding integration to the `integrations` array in the `init` method:

- DB queries made with:
  - `mysql`
  - `mysql2`
  - `pg`
  - `graphql` (including Apollo Server)
  - `mongo`
  - `mongoose`
  - `ioredis`
  - `prisma`

You can add these as follows:

```javascript
const Sentry = require("@sentry/aws-serverless");

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  integrations: [
    Sentry.prismaIntegration(),
    Sentry.mysqlIntegration(),
    Sentry.mysql2Integration(),
    Sentry.pgIntegration(),
    Sentry.graphqlIntegration(),
    Sentry.mongoIntegration(),
    Sentry.mongooseIntegration(),
    Sentry.ioredisIntegration(),
  ],
});
```
