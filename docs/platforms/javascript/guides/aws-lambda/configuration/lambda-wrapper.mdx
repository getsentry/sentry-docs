On this page you'll learn about the options to configure the `Sentry.wrapHandler` wrapper for your Lambda function.

If you're using the AWS Lambda layer with environment variables (i.e. no Sentry code in your function), skip this guide or switch to the [initializing the SDK in code](../../install/cjs-layer#alternative-initialize-the-sdk-in-code).

## Flush Timeout

Sentry keeps the lambda function thread alive for up to 2 seconds to ensure reported errors are sent. You can change this flush time limit by defining a `flushTimeout` value in the handler options:

```javascript {filename:index.js} {2}
exports.handler = Sentry.wrapHandler(yourHandler, {
  flushTimeout: 1000,
});
```

## Timeout Warning

Sentry reports timeout warnings when the Lambda function is within 500ms of its execution time. You can turn off timeout warnings by setting `captureTimeoutWarning` to `false` in the handler options.

```javascript {filename:index.js} {2}
exports.handler = Sentry.wrapHandler(yourHandler, {
  captureTimeoutWarning: false,
});
```

To change the timeout warning limit, assign a numeric value (in ms) to `timeoutWarningLimit`:

```javascript {filename:index.js} {2}
exports.handler = Sentry.wrapHandler(yourHandler, {
  timeoutWarningLimit: 700,
});
```

## Capture Rejected Promises in `Promise.allSettled`

By default, Sentry captures errors raised by your handler.
However, your handler might return a `Promise.allSettled` result.
In this case, even if one of the messages has failed, Sentry won't capture any exception.

The `captureAllSettledReasons` (default: `false`) option captures all promise rejected results

```javascript {tabTitle:captureAllSettledReasons}
exports.handler = Sentry.wrapHandler(
  () => {
    return Promise.allSettled([
      Promise.rejected(new Error("first")),
      Promise.rejected(new Error("second")),
    ]);
  },
  { captureAllSettledReasons: true }
);
// `first` and `second` errors are captured
```
