<Note>

Looking for instructions on how to add Sentry without modifying your code? [Check out these docs instead](/organization/integrations/cloud-monitoring/aws-lambda/).

</Note>

Before you begin, note:

- The estimated time to configure the integration is 5 - 15 minutes.
- You need to have experience with AWS console and a basic understanding of Lambda.
- You'll need an AWS account and you have to create an [IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html).

<Note>This guide is for version 8.0.0 and up of `@sentry/aws-serverless`.</Note>

## Install

<OnboardingOptionButtons
  options={["error-monitoring", "performance", "profiling"]}
/>

Create a deployment package on your local machine and install the required dependencies in the deployment package. For more information, see [Building an AWS Lambda deployment package for Node.js](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/lambda-deployment-package-nodejs/).

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-install" />

We also support [installing Sentry as a Container Image](/platforms/javascript/guides/aws-lambda/container-image/) and [installing Sentry in Lambda Layer](/platforms/javascript/guides/aws-lambda/layer/).

## Configure

You can use the AWS Lambda integration for the Node like this:

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-config" />

## Enable Timeout Warning

Sentry reports timeout warning when the function is within 500ms of its execution time. You can turn off timeout warnings by setting `captureTimeoutWarning` to `false` in the handler options. To change timeout warning limit, assign a numeric value (in ms) to `timeoutWarningLimit`

```javascript {tabTitle:captureTimeoutWarning}
exports.handler = Sentry.wrapHandler(yourHandler, {
  captureTimeoutWarning: false,
});
```

```javascript {tabTitle:timeoutWarning}
exports.handler = Sentry.wrapHandler(yourHandler, {
  timeoutWarningLimit: 50,
});
```

## Capture Rejected Promises in `Promise.allSettled`

By default, Sentry captures errors raised by your handler.
However, your handler might return a `Promise.allSettled` result.
In this case, even if one of the messages has failed, Sentry won't capture any exception.

The `captureAllSettledReasons` (default: `false`) option captures all promise rejected results

```javascript {tabTitle:captureAllSettledReasons}
exports.handler = Sentry.wrapHandler(
  () => {
    return Promise.allSettled([
      Promise.rejected(new Error("first")),
      Promise.rejected(new Error("second")),
    ]);
  },
  { captureAllSettledReasons: true }
);
// `first` and `second` errors are captured
```

## Behavior

With the AWS Lambda integration enabled, the Node SDK will:

- Automatically report all events from your Lambda Functions.
- Allows you to <PlatformLink to="/configuration/sampling/#configuring-the-transaction-sample-rate">modify the transaction sample rate</PlatformLink> using <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" />.
- Issue reports automatically include:
  - A link to the cloudwatch logs
  - Function details
  - sys.argv for the function
  - AWS Request ID
  - Function execution time
  - Function version
- Sentry holds the thread for up to 2 seconds to report errors. You can change flush time limit by defining a `flushTimeout` value in the handler options
