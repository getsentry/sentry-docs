Based on whether your Lambda function runs in CommonJS or ESM, you need to follow the instructions for the corresponding module system.

## My Lambda function is written in TypeScript

If you're using TypeScript, your lambda function is likely transpiled to CommonJS before running it. In this case, follow the [CommonJS instructions](./cjs-npm__v9.x).
Note that TypeScript can also be configured to output ESM, in which case you should follow the [ESM instructions](./esm-npm__v9.x).

## My Lambda function uses `require`

If you are using `require()` in your function, follow the [CommonJS instructions](./cjs-npm__v9.x).

## My Lambda function uses `import`

If you're using `import` syntax in your function and you're _not_ transpiling the code to CommonJS, follow the [ESM instructions](./esm-npm__v9.x).
