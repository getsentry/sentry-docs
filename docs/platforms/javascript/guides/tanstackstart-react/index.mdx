<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-prerequisites" />

## Step 1: Install

Choose the features you want to configure, and this guide will show you how:

<OnboardingOptionButtons
  options={["error-monitoring", "performance", "session-replay"]}
/>

<Expandable title="Want to learn more about these features?">

- [**Issues**](/product/issues) (always enabled): Sentry's core error monitoring product that automatically reports errors,
  uncaught exceptions, and unhandled rejections. If you have something that
  looks like an exception, Sentry can capture it.
- [**Tracing**](/product/tracing): Track software performance while seeing the
  impact of errors across multiple systems. For example, distributed tracing
  allows you to follow a request from the frontend to the backend and back.
- [**Session Replay**](/product/explore/session-replay/web):
  Get to the root cause of an issue faster by viewing a video-like reproduction
  of what was happening in the user's browser before, during, and after the
  problem.

Run the command for your preferred package manager to add the SDK package to your application:

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install @sentry/tanstackstart-react --save
```

```bash {tabTitle:yarn}
yarn add @sentry/tanstackstart-react
```

```bash {tabTitle:pnpm}
pnpm add @sentry/tanstackstart-react
```

## Step 2: Configure

Extend your app's default TanStack Start configuration by adding `wrapVinxiConfigWithSentry` to your `app.config.ts` file:

```TypeScript {filename:app.config.ts}
import { defineConfig } from "@tanstack/react-start/config";
import { wrapVinxiConfigWithSentry } from "@sentry/tanstackstart-react";

const config = defineConfig({
    // ... your other TanStack Start config
})

export default wrapVinxiConfigWithSentry(config, {
  org: "___ORG_SLUG___",
  project: "___PROJECT_SLUG___",
  authToken: process.env.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN,

  // Only print logs for uploading source maps in CI
  // Set to `true` to suppress logs
  silent: !process.env.CI,
});
```

{/* TODO(lforst): Remove "in future versions of this SDK," */}

In future versions of this SDK, setting the `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable will upload sourcemaps for you to see unminified errors in Sentry:

```sh {filename:.env}
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=___ORG_AUTH_TOKEN___
```

<Alert level="warning" title="Important">

Make sure to keep your auth token secret and out of version control.

</Alert>

Add the following initialization code to your `app/client.tsx` file to initialize Sentry on the client:

```tsx {filename:app/client.tsx} {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "12, 15-20", "session-replay": "13,21-26"}}
import { hydrateRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import { StartClient } from "@tanstack/react-start";
import { createRouter } from "./router";

import * as Sentry from "@sentry/tanstackstart-react";

const router = createRouter();

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    Sentry.tanstackRouterBrowserTracingIntegration(router),
    Sentry.replayIntegration(),
  ],

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for tracing.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production.
  // Learn more at https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/options/#traces-sample-rate
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,

  // Capture Replay for 10% of all sessions,
  // plus for 100% of sessions with an error.
  // Learn more at https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/session-replay/configuration/#general-integration-configuration
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,
});

hydrateRoot(document, <StartClient router={router} />);
```

Add the following initialization code anywhere in your `app/ssr.tsx` file to initialize Sentry on the server:

```tsx {filename:app/ssr.tsx} {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "5-11"}}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/tanstackstart-react";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for tracing.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  // Learn more at
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/options/#traces-sample-rate
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

Wrap TanStack Start's `createRootRoute` function using `wrapCreateRootRouteWithSentry` to apply tracing to Server-Side Rendering (SSR):

```tsx {filename:app/routes/__root.tsx} {5}
import type { ReactNode } from "react";
import { createRootRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

// (Wrap `createRootRoute`, not its return value!)
export const Route = wrapCreateRootRouteWithSentry(createRootRoute)({
  // ...
});
```

Wrap TanStack Start's `defaultStreamHandler` function using `wrapStreamHandlerWithSentry` to instrument requests to your server:

```tsx {filename:app/ssr.tsx} {12}
import {
  createStartHandler,
  defaultStreamHandler,
} from "@tanstack/react-start/server";
import { getRouterManifest } from "@tanstack/react-start/router-manifest";
import { createRouter } from "./router";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/tanstackstart-react";

export default createStartHandler({
  createRouter,
  getRouterManifest,
})(Sentry.wrapStreamHandlerWithSentry(defaultStreamHandler));
```

Add the `sentryGlobalServerMiddlewareHandler` to your global middlewares to instrument your server function invocations:

<Alert level="info">

If you haven't done so, create a `app/global-middleware.ts` file as outlined in the [TanStack Start Docs for Global Middleware](https://tanstack.com/start/latest/docs/framework/react/middleware#global-middleware).

</Alert>

```ts {filename:app/global-middleware.ts}
import {
  createMiddleware,
  registerGlobalMiddleware,
} from "@tanstack/react-start";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/tanstackstart-react";

registerGlobalMiddleware({
  middleware: [
    createMiddleware().server(Sentry.sentryGlobalServerMiddlewareHandler()),
  ],
});
```

### Capture Errors in your Error Boundaries and Components

The Sentry SDK cannot capture errors that you manually caught yourself with error boundaries.

If you have React error boundaries in your app and you want to report errors that these boundaries catch to Sentry, apply the [`withErrorBoundary` wrapper](/platforms/javascript/guides/react/features/error-boundary/) to your `ErrorBoundary`:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/tanstackstart-react";

class MyErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  // ...
}

export const MySentryWrappedErrorBoundary = withErrorBoundary(MyErrorBoundary, {
  // ... sentry error wrapper options
});
```

If you defined `errorComponent`s in your Code-Based TanStack Router routes, capture the `error` argument with `captureException` inside a `useEffect` hook:

```tsx {2,6-8}
import { createRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/tanstackstart-react";

const route = createRoute({
  errorComponent: ({ error }) => {
    useEffect(() => {
      Sentry.captureException(error)
    }, [error])

    return (
      // ...
    )
  }
})
```

## Step 3: Verify

Let's test your setup and confirm that Sentry is working correctly and sending data to your Sentry project.

### Issues

To verify that Sentry captures errors and creates issues in your Sentry project, add a test button to an existing page or create a new one:

```tsx
<button
  type="button"
  onClick={() => {
    throw new Error("Sentry Test Error");
  }}
>
  Break the world
</button>
```

<OnboardingOption optionId="performance" hideForThisOption>
  Open the page in a browser and click the button to trigger a frontend error.
</OnboardingOption>

<Alert level="warning" title="Important">

Errors triggered from within your browser's developer tools (like the browser console) are sandboxed, so they will not trigger Sentry's error monitoring.

</Alert>

<OnboardingOption optionId="performance">
### Tracing

To test tracing, create a test API route like `/api/sentry-example-api`:

```typescript {filename:app/routes/api/sentry-example-api.ts}
import { json } from "@tanstack/react-start";
import { createAPIFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-start/api";

// A faulty API route to test Sentry's error monitoring
export const APIRoute = createAPIFileRoute("/api/sentry-example-api")({
  GET: ({ request, params }) => {
    throw new Error("Sentry Example API Route Error");
    return json({ message: "Testing Sentry Error..." });
  },
});
```

Next, update your test button to call this route and throw an error if the response isn't `ok`:

```tsx
<button
  type="button"
  onClick={async () => {
    await Sentry.startSpan(
      {
        name: "Example Frontend Span",
        op: "test",
      },
      async () => {
        const res = await fetch("/api/sentry-example-api");
        if (!res.ok) {
          throw new Error("Sentry Example Frontend Error");
        }
      }
    );
  }}
>
  Break the world
</button>
```

Open the page in a browser and click the button to trigger two errors:

- a frontend error
- an error within the API route

Additionally, this starts a performance trace to measure the time it takes for the API request to complete.

</OnboardingOption>

### View Captured Data in Sentry

Now, head over to your project on [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io) to view the collected data (it takes a couple of moments for the data to appear).

<Expandable title="Need help locating the captured errors in your Sentry project?">

1. Open the [**Issues**](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/issues) page and select an error from the issues list to view the full details and context of this error. For an interactive UI walkthrough, click [here](/product/sentry-basics/integrate-frontend/generate-first-error/#ui-walkthrough).
2. Open the [**Traces**](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/traces) page and select a trace to reveal more information about each span, its duration, and any errors. For an interactive UI walkthrough, click [here](/product/sentry-basics/distributed-tracing/generate-first-error/#ui-walkthrough).
3. Open the [**Replays**](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/replays) page and select an entry from the list to get a detailed view where you can replay the interaction and get more information to help you troubleshoot.

## Next Steps

At this point, you should have integrated Sentry into your TanStack Start application and should already be sending data to your Sentry project.

Now's a good time to customize your setup and look into more advanced topics.
Our next recommended steps for you are:

- Learn how to [manually capture errors](/platforms/javascript/guides/tanstackstart-react/usage/)
- Continue to [customize your configuration](/platforms/javascript/guides/tanstackstart-react/configuration/)
