The TanStack Router integration is included in the `@sentry/tanstackstart-react` package and is compatible with version `1.64.0` of `@tanstack/react-router` and above.

<Alert title="Note">

The TanStack Router integration is designed to work with Sentry Tracing. Please see <PlatformLink to="/tracing/#enable-tracing">Getting Started with TanStack Start React Performance</PlatformLink> for more details on how to set up and install the SDK.

</Alert>

The TanStack Router instrumentation uses your TanStack Router routes to create `pageload/navigation` transactions to ensure you collect meaningful performance data about the health of your page loads and associated requests.

## Usage

To use the TanStack Router integration, pass the `Sentry.tanstackRouterBrowserTracingIntegration` inside your `integrations` option:

```tsx {diff} {filename:src/router.tsx}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/tanstackstart-react";
import { createRouter } from '@tanstack/react-router'

// Create a new router instance
export const getRouter = () => {
  const router = createRouter();

  if (!router.isServer) {
    Sentry.init({
      dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
      integrations: [Sentry.tanstackRouterBrowserTracingIntegration(router)]

      // Setting a sample rate is required for sending performance data.
      // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
      // for finer control.
      tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
    });
  }
  
  return router;
}
```
