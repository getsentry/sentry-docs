The Sentry Next.js SDK supports Next.js applications deployed on Cloudflare Workers, enabling you to capture errors and performance data in your edge environment.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A Sentry [account](https://sentry.io/signup/) and [project](/product/projects/)
- A [Cloudflare Workers project](https://dash.cloudflare.com/workers/overview)
- A Next.js application configured for Cloudflare Workers with [OpenNext](https://opennext.js.org/cloudflare)
- The Sentry SDK [installed and configured](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/) in your Next.js application

<Alert type="info">
  If you haven't deployed a Next.js app to Cloudflare Workers before, follow
  Cloudflare's [Next.js deployment
  guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/nextjs/)
  to get started.
</Alert>

## Configure Wrangler

Once you've set up Sentry in your Next.js application following the [installation guide](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/), you'll need to configure Wrangler with the required compatibility settings.

Add the `nodejs_compat` compatibility flag and set the `compatibility_date` to `2025-08-16` in your Wrangler configuration file:

```json {tabTitle:wrangler.jsonc}
{
  "compatibility_date": "2025-08-16",
  "compatibility_flags": ["nodejs_compat"]
}
```

```toml {tabTitle:wrangler.toml}
compatibility_date = "2025-08-16"
compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]
```

After adding these settings, build and deploy your Next.js application to Cloudflare Workers. You should start seeing error events, traces, and logs appear in Sentry.

## Known Limitations

### Server-Side Span Durations

Server-side spans will display `0ms` for their durations due to a security measure Cloudflare Workers implements to prevent timing attacks. This is expected behavior in the Cloudflare Workers environment.

For more information about this limitation, see the [Cloudflare Workers documentation on Performance APIs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/performance/).
