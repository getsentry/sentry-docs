## Features

In addition to capturing errors, you can monitor interactions between multiple services or applications by [enabling tracing](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/). You can also get to the root of an error or performance issue faster, by watching a video-like reproduction of a user session with [session replay](/product/explore/session-replay/web/getting-started/).

Select which Sentry features you'd like to install in addition to Error Monitoring to get the corresponding installation and configuration instructions below.

  options={[
    "error-monitoring",
    "performance",
    "session-replay",
    "user-feedback",
    "logs",
  ]}
/>

## Step 1: Install

To install Sentry using the installation wizard, run the following command within your project:

```bash
npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i nextjs
```

The wizard then guides you through the setup process, asking you to enable additional (optional) Sentry features for your application beyond error monitoring.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-features-expandable" />

This guide assumes that you enable all features and allow the wizard to create an example page and route. You can add or remove features at any time, but setting them up now will save you the effort of configuring them manually later.

<Expandable title="What does the installation wizard change inside your application?">

- Creates config files with the default `Sentry.init()` calls for all runtimes (Node.js, Browser, and Edge)
- Adds a Next.js instrumentation hook to your project (`instrumentation.ts`)
- Creates or updates your Next.js config with the default Sentry settings
- Creates error handling components (`global-error.(jsx|tsx)` and `_error.jsx` for the Pages Router) if they don't already exist
- Creates `.sentryclirc` with an auth token to upload source maps (this file is automatically added to `.gitignore`)
- Adds an example page and route to your application to help verify your Sentry setup

## Step 2: Configure

If you prefer to configure Sentry manually, here are the configuration files the wizard would create:

### Client-Side Configuration

```javascript {tabTitle:Client} {filename:instrumentation-client.(js|ts)}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // Adds request headers and IP for users, for more info visit:
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/configuration/options/#sendDefaultPii
  sendDefaultPii: true,

  integrations: [
    // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ session-replay
    // Replay may only be enabled for the client-side
    Sentry.replayIntegration(),
    // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ session-replay
    // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ user-feedback
    Sentry.feedbackIntegration({
      // Additional SDK configuration goes in here, for example:
      colorScheme: "system",
    }),
    // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ user-feedback
  ],
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ logs

  // Enable logs to be sent to Sentry
  enableLogs: true,
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ logs

  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ performance
  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for tracing.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  // Learn more at
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/options/#traces-sample-rate
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ performance
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ session-replay
  // Capture Replay for 10% of all
  // plus for 100% of sessions with an error
  // Learn more at
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/session-replay/configuration/#general-integration-configuration
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ session-replay
});

// ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ performance
export const onRouterTransitionStart = Sentry.captureRouterTransitionStart;
// ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ performance
```

### Server-Side Configuration

```javascript {tabTitle:Server} {filename:sentry.server.config.(js|ts)}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // Adds request headers and IP for users, for more info visit:
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/configuration/options/#sendDefaultPii
  sendDefaultPii: true,
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ logs

  // Enable logs to be sent to Sentry
  enableLogs: true,
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ logs

  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ performance
  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for tracing.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  // Learn more at
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/options/#traces-sample-rate
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ performance
});
```

For detailed manual setup instructions, see our [manual setup guide](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/manual-setup/).

## Step 3: Verify Your Setup

<Include name="nextjs-turbopack-warning-expandable.mdx" />

If you haven't tested your Sentry configuration yet, let's do it now. You can confirm that Sentry is working properly and sending data to your Sentry project by using the example page and route created by the installation wizard:

1. Open the example page `/sentry-example-page` in your browser. For most Next.js applications, this will be at localhost.
2. Click the "Throw error" button. This triggers two errors:

- a frontend error
- an error within the API route

Sentry captures both of these errors for you. Additionally, the button click starts a performance trace to measure the time it takes for the API request to complete.

<Alert level="success" title="Tip">

Don't forget to explore the example files' code in your project to understand what's happening after your button click.

### View Captured Data in Sentry

Now, head over to your project on [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io) to view the collected data (it takes a couple of moments for the data to appear).

## Next Steps

At this point, you should have integrated Sentry into your Next.js application and should already be sending error and performance data to your Sentry project.

Now's a good time to customize your setup and look into more advanced topics.
Our next recommended steps for you are:

- Learn about [instrumenting Next.js server actions](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/apis/#server-actions)
- Learn how to [manually capture errors](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/usage/)
- Continue to [customize your configuration](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/configuration/)
- Get familiar with [Sentry's product features](/product) like tracing, insights, and alerts
- Learn more about our [Vercel integration](/organization/integrations/deployment/vercel/)
