## Features

In addition to capturing errors, you can monitor interactions between multiple services or applications by [enabling tracing](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/). You can also get to the root of an error or performance issue faster, by watching a video-like reproduction of a user session with [session replay](/product/explore/session-replay/web/getting-started/).

Send <PlatformLink to="/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/logs/">structured logs</PlatformLink> to Sentry and correlate them with errors and traces.

Select which Sentry features you'd like to configure to get the corresponding setup instructions below.

### Use the Installation Wizard (Recommended)

The wizard will guide you through the setup process, asking you to enable additional (optional) Sentry features for your application beyond error monitoring.

During this setup process, you'll be prompted to either create your project or select an existing project within Sentry.

<Expandable title="What does the installation wizard change inside your application?">

- Creates config files with the default `Sentry.init()` calls for all runtimes (Node.js, Browser, and Edge)
- Adds a Next.js instrumentation hook to your project (`instrumentation.ts`)
- Creates or updates your Next.js config with the default Sentry settings
- Creates error handling components (`global-error.(jsx|tsx)` and `_error.jsx` for the Pages Router) if they don't already exist
- Creates `.sentryclirc` with an auth token to upload source maps (this file is automatically added to `.gitignore`)
- Adds an example page and route to your application to help verify your Sentry setup

## Configure

If you want to expand on your Sentry configuration by adding additional functionality, or manually instrument your application, here are the configuration files the wizard would create. This configuration assumes you enabled all of the functionality the wizard proposed including replays, logs, and tracing.

### Client-Side Configuration

Configure Sentry for client-side error monitoring, performance tracking, and session replay. This configuration is loaded in the browser and includes integrations specific to the client environment.

Key features:
- **Browser Tracing**: Automatically tracks page loads and navigation
- **Session Replay**: Records user sessions for debugging
- **Structured Logs**: Sends client-side logs to Sentry
- **Performance Monitoring**: Captures 100% of transactions (adjust in production)

</SplitSectionText>
<SplitSectionCode>

```javascript {tabTitle:Client} {filename:instrumentation-client.(js|ts)}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // Adds request headers and IP for users, for more info visit:
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/configuration/options/#sendDefaultPii
  sendDefaultPii: true,

  integrations: [
    // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ performance
    Sentry.browserTracingIntegration(),
    // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ performance
    // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ session-replay
    // Replay may only be enabled for the client-side
    Sentry.replayIntegration(),
    // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ session-replay
    // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ user-feedback
    Sentry.feedbackIntegration({
      // Additional SDK configuration goes in here, for example:
      colorScheme: "system",
    }),
    // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ user-feedback
  ],
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ logs

  // Enable logs to be sent to Sentry
  enableLogs: true,
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ logs

  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ performance
  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%

### Server-Side Configuration

Configure Sentry for server-side error monitoring and performance tracking. This runs in Node.js and handles API routes, server components, and server actions.

Key features:
- **Error Monitoring**: Captures server-side exceptions automatically
- **Structured Logs**: Sends server logs to Sentry
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks server-side operations and database queries

For detailed manual setup instructions, see our [manual setup guide](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/manual-setup/).

<SplitSectionCode>

```javascript {tabTitle:Server} {filename:sentry.server.config.(js|ts)}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // Adds request headers and IP for users, for more info visit:
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/configuration/options/#sendDefaultPii
  sendDefaultPii: true,
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ logs

  enableLogs: true,
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ logs

  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ performance
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ performance
});

## Capture Next.js Errors

Make sure runtime errors are surfaced to Sentry using Next.js error components.

<StepConnector selector="h3" showNumbers={false}>
<SplitLayout>

<SplitSection>
<SplitSectionText>

### App Router

Create or update the `global-error.(tsx|jsx)` file to define a custom Next.js GlobalError component. This component will automatically capture errors that occur anywhere in your App Router application and send them to Sentry.

The `useEffect` hook ensures the error is captured when the component mounts, while the `NextError` component provides a user-friendly error UI.

<Alert level="info">
  The installation wizard will scaffold this file for you if it's missing.
</Alert>

</SplitSectionCode>
</SplitSection>

<SplitSection>
<SplitSectionText>

#### Errors from Nested React Server Components

To capture errors from nested React Server Components, use the `onRequestError` hook in your `instrumentation.(js|ts)` file. This ensures that errors occurring deep within your server component tree are properly captured by Sentry.

<Alert type="info">
  Requires `@sentry/nextjs` version `8.28.0` or higher and Next.js 15.
</Alert>

<SplitSectionCode>

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-capture-errors/nextjs/nested-server-components" />

</SplitSectionCode>
</SplitSection>

<SplitSection>
<SplitSectionText>

### Pages Router

For applications using the Pages Router, create or update the `_error.(tsx|jsx)` file to define a custom Next.js error page. This captures errors that occur during server-side rendering or in page components.

The `getInitialProps` method captures the error asynchronously, ensuring Sentry has time to send the error before serverless functions terminate.

## Send Structured Logs

<StepConnector selector="h3" showNumbers={false}>
<SplitLayout>

<SplitSection>
<SplitSectionText>

### Structured Logging

[Structured logging](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/logs/) lets users send text-based log information from their applications to Sentry. Once in Sentry, these logs can be viewed alongside relevant errors, searched by text-string, or searched using their individual attributes.

Use Sentry's logger to capture structured logs with meaningful attributes that help you debug issues and understand user behavior.

</SplitSectionText>
<SplitSectionCode>

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

const { logger } = Sentry;

logger.info("User completed checkout", {
  userId: 123,
  orderId: "order_456",
  amount: 99.99,
});

logger.error("Payment processing failed", {
  errorCode: "CARD_DECLINED",
  userId: 123,
  attemptCount: 3,
});

logger.warn(logger.fmt`Rate limit exceeded for user: ${123}`);
```

## Customize Session Replay

<StepConnector selector="h3" showNumbers={false}>
<SplitLayout>

<SplitSection>
<SplitSectionText>

### Session Replay Configuration

[Replays](/product/explore/session-replay/web/getting-started/) allow you to see video-like reproductions of user sessions. 

By default, Session Replay masks sensitive data to protect privacy and PII data. If needed, you can modify the replay configurations in your client-side Sentry initialization to show (unmask) specific content that's safe to display.

<Alert level="warning">
  Use caution when choosing what content to unmask within your application. This content displays in Replays may contain sensitive information or PII data. 
</Alert>

</SplitSectionText>
<SplitSectionCode>

```javascript {filename:instrumentation-client.(js|ts)}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    Sentry.replayIntegration({
      // This will show the content of the div with the class "reveal-content" and the span with the data-safe-to-show attribute
      unmask: [".reveal-content", "[data-safe-to-show]"],
      // This will show all text content in replays. Use with caution.
      maskAllText: false,
      // This will show all media content in replays. Use with caution.
      blockAllMedia: false,
    }),
  ],
  // Only capture replays for 10% of sessions
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
  // Capture replays for 100% of sessions with an error
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

```jsx
<div className="reveal-content">This content will be visible in replays</div>

<SplitSectionText>

### Custom Tracing

[Tracing](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/tracing/) allows you to monitor interactions between multiple services or applications. Create custom spans to measure specific operations and add meaningful attributes. This helps you understand performance bottlenecks and debug issues with detailed context.

</SplitSectionText>
<SplitSectionCode>

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

async function processUserData(userId) {
  return await Sentry.startSpan(
    {
      name: "Process User Data",
      op: "function",
      attributes: {
        userId: userId,
        operation: "data_processing",
        version: "2.1",
      },
    },
    async () => {
      const userData = await fetch(`/api/user?id=${userId}`).then((r) => r.json());

      return await Sentry.startSpan(
        {
          name: "Transform Data",
          op: "transform",
          attributes: { recordCount: userData.length, transformType: "normalize" },
        },
        () => transformUserData(userData)
      );
    }
  );
}

const span = Sentry.getActiveSpan();
if (span) {
  span.setAttributes({ cacheHit: true, region: "us-west-2", performanceScore: 0.95 });
}
```

## Verify Your Setup

<Include name="nextjs-turbopack-warning-expandable.mdx" />

If you haven't tested your Sentry configuration yet, let's do it now. You can confirm that Sentry is working properly and sending data to your Sentry project by using the example page and route created by the installation wizard:

1. Open the example page `/sentry-example-page` in your browser. For most Next.js applications, this will be at localhost.
2. Click the "Throw error" button. This triggers two errors:

- a frontend error
- an error within the API route

Sentry captures both of these errors for you. Additionally, the button click starts a performance trace to measure the time it takes for the API request to complete.

### View Captured Data in Sentry

Now, head over to your project on [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io) to view the collected data (it takes a couple of moments for the data to appear).

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-browser-sandbox-warning" />

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-verify-locate-data" />

## Next Steps

At this point, you should have integrated Sentry into your Next.js application and should already be sending error and performance data to your Sentry project.

Now's a good time to customize your setup and look into more advanced topics.
Our next recommended steps for you are:

- Learn more about [enriching the data (events) you send to Sentry](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/enriching-events/)
- Explore more about configuring [Structured Logs](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/logs/) in your application
- See advanced configurations for [Replays](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/session-replay)
- Setup and configure [Distributed Tracing](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/tracing/) between the different tiers and services for your application
- Learn how to use the [insights](/product/insights/) views in Sentry to explore performance related information about your application (including the Next.js specific view)
