## Features

In addition to capturing errors, you can monitor interactions between multiple services or applications by [enabling tracing](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/). You can also get to the root of an error or performance issue faster, by watching a video-like reproduction of a user session with [session replay](/product/explore/session-replay/web/getting-started/).

Select which Sentry features you'd like to install in addition to Error Monitoring to get the corresponding installation and configuration instructions below.

    {id: "error-monitoring", checked: true},
    {id: "performance", checked: true},
    {id: "session-replay", checked: true},
    {id: "user-feedback", checked: true},
    {id: "logs", checked: true},
  ]}
/>

## Step 1: Install

To install Sentry using the installation wizard, run the following command within your project:

```bash
npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i nextjs
```

The wizard then guides you through the setup process, asking you to enable additional (optional) Sentry features for your application beyond error monitoring.

This guide assumes that you enable all features and allow the wizard to create an example page and route. You can add or remove features at any time, but setting them up now will save you the effort of configuring them manually later.

### Configure Source Maps (Optional)

For readable stack traces in production, configure source map uploads by adding your Sentry auth token to your environment:

```bash
# Add to your .env.local file
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token_here
```

You can get your auth token from [Sentry Settings > Auth Tokens](https://sentry.io/settings/auth-tokens/). The wizard automatically configures source map upload in your `next.config.js`, but requires this token to work in production.

<Alert level="warning" title="Important">

Make sure to keep your auth token secret and add `.env.local` to your `.gitignore` file to avoid committing it to version control.

</Alert>

<Expandable title="What does the installation wizard change inside your application?">

- Creates config files with the default `Sentry.init()` calls for all runtimes (Node.js, Browser, and Edge)
- Adds a Next.js instrumentation hook to your project (`instrumentation.ts`)
- Creates or updates your Next.js config with the default Sentry settings
- Creates error handling components (`global-error.(jsx|tsx)` and `_error.jsx` for the Pages Router) if they don't already exist
- Creates `.sentryclirc` with an auth token to upload source maps (this file is automatically added to `.gitignore`)
- Adds an example page and route to your application to help verify your Sentry setup

## Step 2: Verify Your Setup

<Include name="nextjs-turbopack-warning-expandable.mdx" />

The installation wizard creates configuration files in your application. Here are the key files that were created:

### Client-Side Configuration

```javascript {tabTitle:Client} {filename:instrumentation-client.(js|ts)}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // Adds request headers and IP for users, for more info visit:
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/configuration/options/#sendDefaultPii
  sendDefaultPii: true,

  integrations: [
    // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ session-replay
    // Replay may only be enabled for the client-side
    Sentry.replayIntegration(),
    // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ session-replay
    // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ user-feedback
    Sentry.feedbackIntegration({
      // Additional SDK configuration goes in here, for example:
      colorScheme: "system",
    }),
    // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ user-feedback
  ],
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ logs

  // Enable logs to be sent to Sentry
  enableLogs: true,
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ logs

  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ performance
  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for tracing.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  // Learn more at
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/options/#traces-sample-rate
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ performance
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ session-replay
  // Capture Replay for 10% of all
  // plus for 100% of sessions with an error
  // Learn more at
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/session-replay/configuration/#general-integration-configuration
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ session-replay
});

// ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ performance
export const onRouterTransitionStart = Sentry.captureRouterTransitionStart;
// ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ performance
```

### Server-Side Configuration

```javascript {tabTitle:Server} {filename:sentry.server.config.(js|ts)}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // Adds request headers and IP for users, for more info visit:
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/configuration/options/#sendDefaultPii
  sendDefaultPii: true,
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ logs

  // Enable logs to be sent to Sentry
  enableLogs: true,
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ logs

  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ performance
  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for tracing.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  // Learn more at
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/options/#traces-sample-rate
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ performance
});
```


<OnboardingOption optionId="logs">

## Step 3: Sending Logs

Now let's add structured logging to capture application insights. Logs are enabled in your configuration files created by the wizard.

Use Sentry's logger to capture structured logs with meaningful attributes that help you debug issues and understand user behavior.

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

const { logger } = Sentry;

// Send structured logs with attributes
logger.info("User completed checkout", { 
  userId: 123, 
  orderId: "order_456", 
  amount: 99.99 
});

logger.error("Payment processing failed", {
  errorCode: "CARD_DECLINED",
  userId: 123,
  attemptCount: 3
});

// Using template literals for dynamic data
logger.warn(logger.fmt`Rate limit exceeded for user: ${userId}`);
```

</OnboardingOption>

<OnboardingOption optionId="session-replay">

## Step 4: Customizing Replays

By default, Session Replay masks sensitive data for privacy. Let's customize this to show specific content that's safe to display.

You can unmask specific elements while keeping sensitive data protected. Add CSS classes or data attributes to elements you want to reveal in replays.

```javascript {tabTitle:Client} {filename:instrumentation-client.(js|ts)}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    Sentry.replayIntegration({
      // Unmask specific elements to show actual content
      unmask: ['.reveal-content', '[data-safe-to-show]'],
      // Optionally disable blanket masking for non-sensitive apps
      maskAllText: false,
      blockAllMedia: false,
    }),
  ],
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,
  // ... your existing config
});
```

```html
<div className="reveal-content">This content will be visible in replays</div>
<span data-safe-to-show>Safe user data: {username}</span>
```

</OnboardingOption>

<OnboardingOption optionId="performance">

## Step 5: Distributed Tracing Configuration

Enable trace propagation to connect performance data across your services. This allows you to follow requests as they move between your frontend, backend, and external APIs.

Configure `tracePropagationTargets` to specify which services should be connected in your traces.

```javascript {tabTitle:Client} {filename:instrumentation-client.(js|ts)}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [Sentry.browserTracingIntegration()],
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  // Configure trace propagation for your backend services
  tracePropagationTargets: [
    'https://api.yourapp.com',
    'https://auth.yourapp.com', 
    /^\\/api\\//  // Local API routes
  ],
  // ... your existing config
});
```

```typescript {filename:app/layout.tsx}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";
import type { Metadata } from "next";

export function generateMetadata(): Metadata {
  return {
    // ... your existing metadata
    other: {
      ...Sentry.getTraceData(),
    },
  };
}
```

## Step 6: Custom Traces with Attributes

Create custom spans to measure specific operations and add meaningful attributes. This helps you understand performance bottlenecks and debug issues with detailed context.

Use nested spans to break down complex operations and add attributes that provide business context.

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

// Create custom spans to measure specific operations
async function processUserData(userId: string) {
  return await Sentry.startSpan(
    {
      name: "Process User Data",
      op: "function",
      attributes: {
        userId: userId,
        operation: "data_processing",
        version: "2.1"
      }
    },
    async () => {
      // Your business logic here
      const userData = await fetchUserData(userId);
      
      // Nested span for specific operations
      return await Sentry.startSpan(
        { 
          name: "Transform Data", 
          op: "transform",
          attributes: { 
            recordCount: userData.length,
            transformType: "normalize" 
          }
        },
        () => {
          return transformUserData(userData);
        }
      );
    }
  );
}

// Add attributes to existing spans
const span = Sentry.getActiveSpan();
if (span) {
  span.setAttributes({
    cacheHit: true,
    region: "us-west-2",
    performanceScore: 0.95
  });
}
```

</OnboardingOption>

## Verify Your Setup

If you haven't tested your Sentry configuration yet, let's do it now. You can confirm that Sentry is working properly and sending data to your Sentry project by using the example page and route created by the installation wizard:

1. Open the example page `/sentry-example-page` in your browser. For most Next.js applications, this will be at localhost.
2. Click the "Throw error" button. This triggers two errors:

- a frontend error
- an error within the API route

Sentry captures both of these errors for you. Additionally, the button click starts a performance trace to measure the time it takes for the API request to complete.

<Alert level="success" title="Tip">

Don't forget to explore the example files' code in your project to understand what's happening after your button click.

</Alert>

### View Captured Data in Sentry

Now, head over to your project on [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io) to view the collected data (it takes a couple of moments for the data to appear).

## Next Steps

At this point, you should have integrated Sentry into your Next.js application and should already be sending error and performance data to your Sentry project.

Now's a good time to customize your setup and look into more advanced topics:

- Learn about [instrumenting Next.js server actions](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/apis/#server-actions)
- Learn how to [manually capture errors](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/usage/)
- Continue to [customize your configuration](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/configuration/)
- Get familiar with [Sentry's product features](/product) like tracing, insights, and alerts
