## Install

Run the Sentry wizard to automatically configure Sentry in your Next.js application:

```bash
npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i nextjs
```

<Alert level="success" title="Tip">

We recommend enabling all features during setup: [Tracing](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/tracing/), [Session Replay](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/session-replay/), and [Logs](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/logs/). You can always adjust them later.

</Alert>

<Expandable title="What does the installation wizard do?">

The wizard will guide you through:

- Selecting or creating your Sentry project
- Installing the `@sentry/nextjs` package
- Enabling optional features ([Tracing](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/tracing/), [Session Replay](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/session-replay/), [Logs](/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/logs/))

It automatically creates and configures the following files:

- `sentry.server.config.ts` - Server-side SDK initialization
- `sentry.edge.config.ts` - Edge runtime SDK initialization
- `instrumentation-client.ts` - Client-side SDK initialization
- `instrumentation.ts` - Next.js instrumentation hook
- `next.config.ts` - Updated with Sentry configuration
- `global-error.tsx` - App Router error boundary
- `app/sentry-example-page/` - Example page to test your setup
- `app/api/sentry-example-api/` - Example API route
- `.env.sentry-build-plugin` - Auth token for source map uploads (added to `.gitignore`)

## Verify

After the wizard completes, verify that Sentry is working correctly by going through this checklist:
