The Sentry Next.js SDK supports automatic code injection and source map upload during your app's build process using the `withSentryConfig` wrapper in your Next.js configuration file (`next.config.js` or `next.config.mjs`). For information on updating the configuration, see [Extend Next.js Configuration](../../manual-setup/#extend-your-nextjs-configuration).

## Available Options

<TableOfContents ignoreIds={["available-options"]} />

## Core Options

<SdkOption name="org" type="string" envVar="SENTRY_ORG">

The slug of the Sentry organization associated with the app.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="project" type="string" envVar="SENTRY_PROJECT">

The slug of the Sentry project associated with the app.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="authToken" type="string" envVar="SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN">

The authentication token to use for all communication with Sentry. Can be obtained from https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/settings/auth-tokens/.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="sentryUrl" type="string" envVar="SENTRY_URL" defaultValue="https://sentry.io/">

The base URL of your Sentry instance. Use this if you are using a self-hosted or Sentry instance other than sentry.io.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="headers" type="Record<string, string>">

Headers added to every outgoing network request.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="telemetry" type="boolean" defaultValue="true">

If set to true, internal plugin errors and performance data will be sent to Sentry.

At Sentry we like to use Sentry ourselves to deliver faster and more stable products. We're very careful of what we're sending. We won't collect anything other than error and high-level performance data. We will never collect your code or any details of the projects in which you're using this plugin.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="silent" type="boolean" defaultValue="false">

Suppresses all Sentry SDK build logs.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="debug" type="boolean" defaultValue="false">

Prints additional debug information about the SDK and uploading source maps when building the application.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="errorHandler" type="(error: Error) => void">

A callback function that will be invoked when errors occur during the Sentry build process. This is particularly useful for preventing CI/CD pipeline failures when Sentry services are experiencing downtime or connectivity issues.

By default, build errors will cause the build to fail. You can use this option to handle errors gracefully:

```javascript
withSentryConfig(nextConfig, {
  // ... other options
  errorHandler: (error) => {
    console.warn('Sentry build error occurred:', error);
    // Optionally, you can still fail the build for specific errors
    // if (error.message.includes('critical')) {
    //   throw error;
    // }
  }
});
```

This allows your builds to continue even when Sentry-related operations fail, ensuring that temporary Sentry outages don't block your deployments.

</SdkOption>

## Source Maps Options

<SdkOption name="sourcemaps.disable" type="boolean">

Disable any functionality related to source maps.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="sourcemaps.assets" type="string | string[]">

A glob or an array of globs that specifies the build artifacts that should be uploaded to Sentry. If not specified, the plugin will try to upload all JavaScript files and source map files created during build.

The globbing patterns follow the implementation of the `glob` package.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="sourcemaps.ignore" type="string | string[]" defaultValue="[]">

A glob or an array of globs that specifies which build artifacts should not be uploaded to Sentry.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="sourcemaps.deleteSourcemapsAfterUpload" type="boolean" defaultValue="false">

Toggle whether generated source maps within your Next.js build folder should be automatically deleted after being uploaded to Sentry.

</SdkOption>

## Release Options

<SdkOption name="release.name" type="string" envVar="SENTRY_RELEASE">

Unique identifier for the release you want to create. Defaults to automatically detecting a value for your environment.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="release.create" type="boolean" defaultValue="true">

Whether the plugin should create a release on Sentry during the build.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="release.finalize" type="boolean" defaultValue="true">

Whether the Sentry release should be automatically finalized after the build ends.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="release.dist" type="string">

Unique identifier for the distribution, used to further segment your release. Usually your build number.

</SdkOption>

## Bundle Size Optimizations

<SdkOption name="bundleSizeOptimizations.excludeDebugStatements" type="boolean">

If set to `true`, the Sentry SDK will attempt to tree-shake any debugging code within itself during the build.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="bundleSizeOptimizations.excludeTracing" type="boolean">

If set to `true`, the Sentry SDK will attempt to tree-shake code related to tracing and performance monitoring.

**Notice:** Do not enable this when using any performance monitoring-related SDK features.

</SdkOption>

## Next.js Specific Options

<SdkOption name="widenClientFileUpload" type="boolean" defaultValue="false">

Include Next.js-internal code and code from dependencies when uploading source maps.

<Expandable type="note" title="When and why to widen the upload scope.">
  If you find that there are some frames in your client-side stack traces that
  aren't getting source-mapped even when most others are, the issue might be
  that those frames are from files in `static/chunks/` rather than
  `static/chunks/pages/`. By default, such files aren't uploaded because the
  majority of the files in `static/chunks/` only contain Next.js or third-party
  code. To upload all of the files and source maps, including ones from
  third-party packages, set the `widenClientFileUpload` option to `true`.
</Expandable>

Note: Enabling this option can lead to longer build times.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="autoInstrumentServerFunctions" type="boolean" defaultValue="true">

Automatically instrument Next.js data fetching methods and Next.js API routes with error and performance monitoring.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="autoInstrumentMiddleware" type="boolean" defaultValue="true">

Automatically instrument Next.js middleware with error and performance monitoring.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="autoInstrumentAppDirectory" type="boolean" defaultValue="true">

Automatically instrument components in the `app` directory with error monitoring.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="excludeServerRoutes" type="Array<RegExp | string>">
Exclude specific server-side API routes or pages from automatic Sentry instrumentation during build time.
This option takes an array of strings or regular expressions and affects pages in the `pages` and `app` directories.

When defining routes, note the following:

- Specify pages as routes and not as file system paths. For example, write `/animals` instead of `pages/animals/index.js`.
- Make sure that any provided string matches the route exactly, has a leading slash, and doesn't have a trailing slash.

```javascript
excludeServerRoutes: [
  "/some/excluded/route",
  "/excluded/route/with/[parameter]",
  /^\/route\/beginning\/with\/some\/prefix/,
  /\/routeContainingASpecificPathSegment\/?/,
];
```

<Alert level="info">
  If you're building your Next.js application with Turbopack, this option will
  have no effect. The Sentry SDK will no longer apply build-time instrumentation
  and will rely purely on Next.js telemetry features.
</Alert>

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="tunnelRoute" type="string">
<Alert level="info">
This feature requires **Next.js version 11+** and doesn't currently work with self-hosted Sentry instances.
</Alert>

Tunnel Sentry requests through this route on your Next.js server to prevent ad-blockers from blocking Sentry events from being sent.
This route should be a path, like `/error-monitoring`, as it adds an API endpoint within your application.

Learn more about tunneling in the <PlatformLink to="/troubleshooting/#dealing-with-ad-blockers">troubleshooting section</PlatformLink>.

<Expandable level="warning" title="Complications with Next.js middleware">
  Client-side event recording will fail if your Next.js middleware intercepts
  the configured route. To prevent this, exclude the tunnel route by adding a
  negative matcher to your middleware like `(?!monitoring-tunnel)`.
</Expandable>

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="automaticVercelMonitors" type="boolean" defaultValue="false">

Automatically create cron monitors in Sentry for your Vercel Cron Jobs if configured via `vercel.json`.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption
  name="unstable_sentryWebpackPluginOptions"
  type="SentryWebpackPluginOptions"
>
  Pass configuration options directly to the [Sentry Webpack
  Plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/webpack-plugin) that ships with
  the Sentry Next.js SDK. If `withSentryConfig` doesn't provide the option you
  need to modify, you may override the `sentryWebpackPluginOptions` using this
  option.
  <Alert level="warning" title="Important">
    This option is considered unstable, and its API may change in a breaking way
    in any release.
  </Alert>
</SdkOption>
