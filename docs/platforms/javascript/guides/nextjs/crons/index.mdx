Monitor the uptime and performance of your scheduled jobs in Next.js. Get alerts when jobs fail, timeout, or don't run as expected.

## Setup Methods

Choose the method that matches your current setup:

* [UI Setup](/platforms/javascript/common/crons/ui-setup) - Create monitors in Sentry's web interface, then add instrumentation

### Automatic Integration

* [Vercel Automatic Integration](vercel-automatic) - Auto-instrument Vercel Cron Jobs (Pages Router only)
* [node-cron](/platforms/javascript/common/crons/node-cron) - Auto-instrument node-cron library
* [cron](/platforms/javascript/common/crons/cron-library) - Auto-instrument cron library  
* [node-schedule](/platforms/javascript/common/crons/node-schedule) - Auto-instrument node-schedule library

If you're using one of these popular cron libraries, use the automatic integration for seamless monitoring.

#### Manual Methods

* [Job Monitoring](/platforms/javascript/common/crons/job-monitoring) - Use withMonitor wrapper for automatic status tracking
* [Check-Ins](/platforms/javascript/common/crons/check-ins) - Full control with manual status updates
* [Heartbeat](/platforms/javascript/common/crons/heartbeat) - Simple success/failure notifications
* [Upserting Monitors](/platforms/javascript/common/crons/upserting-monitors) - Programmatic monitor creation and management

### Alternative Methods (Not Recommended)

These methods work but don't provide the full benefits of SDK integration like tracing and error context:

* [Sentry CLI](https://docs.sentry.io/cli/crons/) - Command-line tool for basic monitoring
* [HTTP API](https://docs.sentry.io/product/crons/getting-started/http/) - Direct API calls for check-ins

## Next.js-Specific Considerations

### Server and Edge Runtimes

Cron monitoring is only supported in **Server and Edge runtimes** for Next.js. Client-side monitoring is not available.

### App Router vs Pages Router

- **Vercel Automatic Integration**: Only works with Pages Router
- **All other methods**: Work with both App Router and Pages Router

### API Routes Example

For App Router route handlers:

```typescript {filename:app/api/cron/route.ts}
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/nextjs';

export async function GET() {
  return Sentry.withMonitor('daily-report', async () => {
    // Your cron job logic here
    await generateDailyReport();
    return new Response('Report generated', { status: 200 });
  });
}
```

For Pages Router API routes:

```typescript {filename:pages/api/cron.ts}
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/nextjs';
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';

export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  return Sentry.withMonitor('daily-report', async () => {
    // Your cron job logic here
    await generateDailyReport();
    res.status(200).json({ message: 'Report generated' });
  });
}
```

## Alerts

When your recurring job fails to check in (missed), runs beyond its configured maximum runtime (failed), or manually reports a failure, Sentry will create an error event with a tag to your monitor.

To receive alerts about these events:

1. Navigate to **Alerts** in the sidebar.
2. Create a new alert and select "Issues" under "Errors" as the alert type.
3. Configure your alert and define a filter match to use: `The event's tags match {key} {match} {value}`.

Example: `The event's tags match monitor.slug equals my-monitor-slug-here`

Learn more in [Issue Alert Configuration](/product/alerts/alert-types/#issue-alerts).

## Rate Limits

Crons imposes a rate limit on check-ins to prevent abuse and resource overuse. Specifically, you can only send a maximum of **6 check-ins per minute per existing monitor environment**. This limit is enforced on a per-project basis, meaning that the rate limit applies collectively to all monitor environments within a given project. You can check if any of your check-ins are being dropped in the [Usage Stats](/product/stats/) page.

To avoid dropped check-ins, it is crucial to manage and distribute your check-ins efficiently within the rate limits. This will help maintain accurate monitoring and ensure that all critical check-ins are captured and processed.
