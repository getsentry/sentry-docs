Sentry's Wasm integration enhances the Browser SDK, and allows it to provide more detailed debug information not only for the error itself, but also for the entire module it was executed from. It includes things like Debug IDs, Debug Files, Code IDs, Code Files and memory addresses.

## Install

Install `@sentry/browser` and `@sentry/wasm` using your package manager:


```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install @sentry/browser @sentry/wasm --save
```

```bash {tabTitle:yarn}
yarn add @sentry/browser @sentry/wasm
```

```bash {tabTitle:pnpm}
pnpm add @sentry/browser @sentry/wasm
```

## Configure

<SignInNote />

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";
import { wasmIntegration } from "@sentry/wasm";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    wasmIntegration()
  ],
});
```

## Verify

Now, whenever any code from WebAssembly module will throw an error, it'll get captured, and it'll contain all the necessary information.

```javascript
function executeInternalWasmStuff() {
  throw new Error("whoops");
}

const { instance } = await WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(
  fetch("very-complex-module.wasm"), {
    env: {
      external_func: executeInternalWasmStuff,
    }
  }
);

instance.exports.internal_func();
```

If you are curious how Wasm modules look from the inside, here's a quick example written in Rust:

```rust
#![no_std]

#[panic_handler]
fn panic(_info: &core::panic::PanicInfo) -> ! {
    loop {}
}

extern "C" {
    pub fn external_func();
}

#[no_mangle]
pub fn internal_func() {
    unsafe {
        external_func();
    }
}
```
