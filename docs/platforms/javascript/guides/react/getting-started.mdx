<PlatformContent includePath="llm-rules-platform" />

This guide covers the full getting started pocess for the React SDK and assumes you want to utilize Error Monitoring, Logs, Tracing and Spans, and Replays. For the basic quickstart, the [React Quickstart](/platforms/javascript/guides/react/) guide is a better starting point.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-prerequisites" />

<StepConnector>

## Install

Run the command for your preferred package manager to add the Sentry SDK to your application:

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install @sentry/react --save
```

### Add Readable Stack Traces With Source Maps (Optional)

## Configure

### Initialize the Sentry SDK

To import and initialize Sentry, create a file in your project's root directory, for example, `instrument.js`, and add the following code:

```javascript {filename:instrument.js}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  
  // Adds request headers and IP for users, for more info visit:
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/react/configuration/options/#sendDefaultPii
  sendDefaultPii: true,
  
  integrations: [
    // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ performance
    Sentry.browserTracingIntegration(),
    // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ performance
    // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ session-replay
    Sentry.replayIntegration(),
    // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ session-replay
    // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ user-feedback
    Sentry.feedbackIntegration({
      // Additional SDK configuration goes in here, for example:
      colorScheme: "system",
    }),
    // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ user-feedback
    // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ logs
    Sentry.consoleLoggingIntegration({ levels: ["log", "warn", "error"] }),
    // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ logs
  ],
  
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ logs
    // For help logging, see: https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/react/logging/
    enableLogs: true,
    // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ logs

  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ performance
  // Set sample rate for performance monitoring
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ performance

  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ session-replay
  // For session replay
  // See: https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/session-replay/
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1, // Sample 10% of sessions
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0, // Sample 100% of sessions with an error
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ session-replay

  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ logs
  // For help logging, see: https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/react/logging/
  extraErrorDataIntegration: false,
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ logs
});
```

### Import & Use the Instrument file

Import the `instrument.js` file in your application's entry point _before all other imports_ to initialize the SDK:

```javascript {filename:index.jsx} {1}
import "./instrument.js";
import { StrictMode } from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";

const container = document.getElementById("root");
const root = createRoot(container);
root.render(<App />);
```

## Capture React Errors

To make sure Sentry captures all your app's errors, configure error handling based on your React version.

### React 19+

Starting with React 19, use the `onCaughtError` and `onUncaughtError` root options to capture React errors:

```javascript {9-15} {filename:index.jsx}
import "./instrument.js";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";

const container = document.getElementById("root");
const root = createRoot(container, {
  // Callback for errors caught by React error boundaries
  onCaughtError: Sentry.reactErrorHandler((error, errorInfo) => {
    console.error("Caught error:", error, errorInfo.componentStack);
  }),
  // Callback for errors not caught by React error boundaries  
  onUncaughtError: Sentry.reactErrorHandler(),
});
root.render(<App />);
```

<Expandable title="React 16â€“18">

### React 16 - 18

Use the Sentry Error Boundary to wrap your application:

```javascript {filename:index.jsx}
import React from "react";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";

<Sentry.ErrorBoundary fallback={<p>An error has occurred</p>} showDialog>
  <App />
</Sentry.ErrorBoundary>;
```

<Alert>
  Alternatively, if you're using a class component, you can wrap your application
  with `Sentry.withErrorBoundary`. Find out more
  [here](features/error-boundary/#manually-capturing-errors).
 </Alert>

</Expandable>

## Sending Logs

[Structured logging](/platforms/javascript/guides/react/logs/) lets users send text-based log information from their applications to Sentry. Once in Sentry, these logs can be viewed alongside relevant errors, searched by text-string, or searched using their individual attributes.

Use Sentry's logger to capture structured logs with meaningful attributes that help you debug issues and understand user behavior.

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";

const { logger } = Sentry;

// Send structured logs with attributes
logger.info("User completed checkout", { 
  userId: 123, 
  orderId: "order_456", 
  amount: 99.99 
});

logger.error("Payment processing failed", {
  errorCode: "CARD_DECLINED",
  userId: 123,
  attemptCount: 3
});

// Using template literals for dynamic data
logger.warn(logger.fmt`Rate limit exceeded for user: ${userId}`);
```

## Customizing Replays (Optional) 

[Replays](/product/explore/session-replay/web/getting-started/) allow you to see video-like reproductions of user sessions. 

By default, Session Replay masks sensitive data for privacy and to protect PII data. You can modify the replay configurations in your client-side Sentry initialization to show (unmask) specific content that's safe to display.

```javascript {filename:instrument.js}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    Sentry.replayIntegration({
      // This will show the content of the div with the class "reveal-content" and the span with the data-safe-to-show attribute
      unmask: [".reveal-content", "[data-safe-to-show]"],
      // This will show all text content in replays. Use with caution.
      maskAllText: false,
      // This will show all media content in replays. Use with caution.
      blockAllMedia: false,
    }),
  ],
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,
  // ... your existing config
});
```

```jsx
<div className="reveal-content">This content will be visible in replays</div>
<span data-safe-to-show>Safe user data: {username}</span>
```

## Custom Traces with Attributes (Optional) 

[Tracing](/platforms/javascript/guides/react/tracing/) allows you to monitor interactions between multiple services or applications. Create custom spans to measure specific operations and add meaningful attributes. This helps you understand performance bottlenecks and debug issues with detailed context.

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";

// Create custom spans to measure specific operations
async function processUserData(userId) {
  return await Sentry.startSpan(
    {
      name: "Process User Data",
      op: "function",
      attributes: {
        userId: userId,
        operation: "data_processing",
        version: "2.1"
      }
    },
    async () => {
      // Your business logic here
      const userData = await fetchUserData(userId);
      
      // Nested span for specific operations
      return await Sentry.startSpan(
        { 
          name: "Transform Data", 
          op: "transform",
          attributes: { 
            recordCount: userData.length,
            transformType: "normalize" 
          }
        },
        () => {
          return transformUserData(userData);
        }
      );
    }
  );
}

// Add attributes to existing spans
const span = Sentry.getActiveSpan();
if (span) {
  span.setAttributes({
    cacheHit: true,
    region: "us-west-2",
    performanceScore: 0.95
  });
}
```

## Avoid Ad Blockers With Tunneling (Optional)

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-tunneling" />

## Verify Your Setup

Let's test your setup and confirm that Sentry is working correctly and sending data to your Sentry project.

### Test Error Capturing

Add the following test button to one of your pages, which will trigger an error that Sentry will capture when you click it:

```javascript
<button
  type="button"
  onClick={() => {
    throw new Error("Sentry Test Error");
  }}
>
  Break the world
</button>
```

Open the page in a browser (for most React applications, this will be at localhost) and click the button to trigger a frontend error.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-browser-sandbox-warning" />

### View Captured Data in Sentry

Now, head over to your project on [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io/) to view the collected data (it takes a couple of moments for the data to appear).

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-verify-locate-data" />

</StepConnector>

## Next Steps

At this point, you should have integrated Sentry into your React application and should already be sending error and performance data to your Sentry project.

Now's a good time to customize your setup and look into more advanced topics:

- Extend Sentry to your backend using one of our [SDKs](/)
- Continue to <PlatformLink to="/configuration">customize your configuration</PlatformLink>
- <PlatformLink to="/features/error-boundary">Learn more about the React Error Boundary</PlatformLink>
- Learn how to <PlatformLink to="/usage">manually capture errors</PlatformLink>
- Avoid ad-blockers with <PlatformLink to="/troubleshooting/#using-the-tunnel-option">tunneling</PlatformLink>

## Additional Resources

<Expandable title="Set Up React Router (Optional)">

If you're using `react-router` in your application, you need to set up the Sentry integration for your specific React Router version to trace `navigation` events.

Select your React Router version to start instrumenting your routing:

- [React Router v7 (library mode)](features/react-router/v7)
- [React Router v6](features/react-router/v6)
- [Older React Router versions](features/react-router)
- [TanStack Router](features/tanstack-router)
