Sentry offers the ability to track your React components to unlock additional insights in your application.

## Component Name Tracking

You can track the names of React components in your application via a [Babel plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/babel-plugin-component-annotate), which can unlock powerful workflows. For example, you can search for replays where a certain React component was clicked on. You can also see the name of the component that was clicked on in breadcrumbs, and spans in Performance. This considerably decreases the level of ambiguity regarding the specific element on the page that was interacted with, as you would normally see just the element's CSS selector (which is also subject to further ambiguity during the minification process).

There will be more features released down the line that will leverage component name tracking, so it is highly recommended to configure your project to use it.

### How to Install

<Alert>

Please note that your Sentry browser SDK must be at version `7.91.0` or higher before you can use these features.
Only React components in `.jsx` or `.tsx` files can be tracked.

</Alert>

There are two different ways you can setup React component name tracking in your application:

1. Install [Sentry's bundler plugins](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/bundler-plugin-core)
2. Directly install [@sentry/babel-plugin-component-annotate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/babel-plugin-component-annotate)

It's recommended that you use the first option, as the Sentry bundler plugins come packed with additional useful features to enrich your Sentry workflows, such as automatic sourcemap upload,
release creation, automatic release name discovery, and release injection. However, you have the option of installing the standalone Babel plugin as well.

**Setup via bundler plugins**:

Follow the instructions in the npm page for the bundler that your project uses:
- [Rollup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/rollup-plugin)
- [Vite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/vite-plugin)
- [Webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/webpack-plugin)

Please note that although there is a Sentry bundler plugin for **esbuild**, React component name tracking is not currently supported by it.

Once you've followed the instructions to install the bundler plugin and added it to your bundler's config, enable component name tracking by setting the flag
to enable it to `true`:


```javascript
// Example specific to Vite, see documentation for other bundlers
sentryVitePlugin({
    // ... other options above
    reactComponentAnnotation: { enabled: true }
}),
```

<Alert>

**Important Note**: If you are using **Rollup** as your bundler, ensure that you place `sentryRollupPlugin` before any other plugins that transform your JSX

</Alert>

Now, you will be able to see your component names in breadcrumbs, spans, and search for replays by component names like so:

### How It Works

The Babel plugin parses your application's JSX source code at build-time, and applies additional `data` attributes onto it.
These attributes will appear on the DOM nodes of your application's built HTML, indicating the React component and file that each node is sourced from. For example, if you had a component named
`MyAwesomeComponent` in the file `myAwesomeComponent.jsx`:

```javascript
function MyAwesomeComponent() {
  return <div>This is a really cool and awesome component!</div>
}
```

After your bundler applies the plugin and builds your project, the resulting DOM node would look like this:

```html
<div data-sentry-component="MyAwesomeComponent" data-sentry-source-file="myAwesomeComponent.jsx">This is a really cool and awesome component!</div>
```

The Sentry browser SDK will pick off the value from these `data` attributes and collect them when your components are interacted with.

## Component Performance Monitoring

Sentry's React SDK offers a feature to monitor the performance of your React components: component tracking. The SDK exports a `withProfiler` higher-order component that attaches React related spans to the current active transaction on the scope. This allows you to get a drilled-down view into how your components are behaving so you can do things like identify slow mounts or frequent updates, which might have an impact on your app's performance.

<Alert>

To set up component tracking, you need to configure performance monitoring. For details on how to do this, check out our [Performance documentation](/platforms/javascript/guides/react/performance/).

</Alert>

In the example below, the `withProfiler` higher-order component is used to instrument an app component.

```javascript
import React from "react";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <FancyComponent>
        <NestedComponent someProp={2} />
        <AnotherComponent />
      </FancyComponent>
    );
  }
}

export default Sentry.withProfiler(App);
```

The React Profiler currently generates spans with three different kinds of op-codes: `ui.react.mount`, `ui.react.render`, and `ui.react.update`.

`ui.react.mount`

The span that represents how long it took for the profiled component to mount.

`ui.react.render`

The span that represents how long the profiled component was on a page. This span is only generated if the profiled component mounts and unmounts while a transaction is occurring.

`ui.react.update`

The span that represents when the profiled component updated. This span is only generated if the profiled component has mounted.

<Alert>

In [React Strict Mode](https://reactjs.org/docs/strict-mode.html), certain component methods will be [invoked twice](https://reactjs.org/docs/strict-mode.html#detecting-unexpected-side-effects). This may lead to duplicate `ui.react.mount` spans appearing in a transaction. React Strict Mode only runs in development mode, so this will have no impact on your production traces.

</Alert>

### Profiler Options

The `withProfiler` higher-order component has a variety of options for further customization. They can be passed in as the second argument to the `withProfiler` function.

```javascript
export default Sentry.withProfiler(App, { name: "CustomAppName" });
```

`name` (string)

The name of the component being profiled. By default, the name is taken from the component `displayName` property or the component `name` property.

`includeRender` (boolean)

If a `ui.react.render` span should be created by the Profiler. Set as true by default.

`includeUpdates` (boolean)

If `react.update` spans should be created by the Profiler. Set as true by default. We recommend setting this prop as false for components that will experience many rerenders, such as text input components, as the resulting spans can be very noisy.
