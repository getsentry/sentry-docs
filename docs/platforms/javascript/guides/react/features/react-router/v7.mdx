<Alert level="info">
- React Router v7 (library mode) support is included in the `@sentry/react` package since version `8.42.0`.
- React Router v7 (framework mode) is not yet supported.
</Alert>

Update your `Sentry.browserTracingIntegration` to `Sentry.reactRouterV7BrowserTracingIntegration` and provide the required React hooks and router functions:

    - `useEffect` hook from `react`
    - `useLocation` and `useNavigationType` hooks from `react-router`
    - `createRoutesFromChildren` and `matchRoutes` functions from `react-router`

<Alert level="warning">

Make sure you call `Sentry.init`, **before** you wrap your `<Routes />` component or the `useRoutes` hook. Otherwise, the routing instrumentation may not work properly.

</Alert>

### Usage with `createBrowserRouter`

If you choose to create your router instance with [`createBrowserRouter`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/routers/create-browser-router) from the `react-router` package, you can use `Sentry.wrapCreateBrowserRouterV7` to wrap it with the instrumentation:


```javascript {2-8, 15-21, 26-33}
import React from "react";
import {
  createBrowserRouter,
  createRoutesFromChildren,
  matchRoutes,
  useLocation,
  useNavigationType,
} from "react-router";

import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    Sentry.reactRouterV7BrowserTracingIntegration({
      useEffect: React.useEffect,
      useLocation,
      useNavigationType,
      createRoutesFromChildren,
      matchRoutes,
    }),
  ],
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

const sentryCreateBrowserRouter =
  Sentry.wrapCreateBrowserRouterV7(createBrowserRouter);

const router = sentryCreateBrowserRouter([
  // your routes...
]);
```

<Alert level="warning" title="Note">

You can instrument [`createMemoryRouter`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/routers/create-memory-router) and [`createHashRouter`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/routers/create-hash-router) using the `wrapCreateBrowserRouter` function.

</Alert>


### Usage With `<Routes />` Component

If you're using the `<Routes />` component to define your routes, wrap [`Routes`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/components/routes) using `Sentry.withSentryReactRouterV7Routing`. This creates a higher order component, which will enable Sentry to reach your router context. You can also use `Sentry.withSentryReactRouterV7Routing` for `Routes` inside `BrowserRouter`. `MemoryRouter`, and `HashRouter` components:


```javascript {3-11, 18-24, 29, 33-35}
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import {
  Routes,
  Route,
  BrowserRouter,
  useLocation,
  useNavigationType,
  createRoutesFromChildren,
  matchRoutes,
} from "react-router";

import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    Sentry.reactRouterV7BrowserTracingIntegration({
      useEffect: React.useEffect,
      useLocation,
      useNavigationType,
      createRoutesFromChildren,
      matchRoutes,
    }),
  ],
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

const SentryRoutes = Sentry.withSentryReactRouterV7Routing(Routes);

ReactDOM.render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <SentryRoutes>
      <Route path="/" element={<div>Home</div>} />
    </SentryRoutes>
  </BrowserRouter>
);
```

This is only needed at the top level of your app, rather than how v4/v5 required wrapping every `<Route/>` you wanted parametrized.

### Usage With `useRoutes` Hook

If you specify your route definitions as an object to the [`useRoutes` hook](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/hooks/use-routes), use `Sentry.wrapUseRoutesV7` to create a patched `useRoutes` hook that instruments your routes with Sentry.

<Alert level="warning">

`wrapUseRoutesV7` should be called outside of a React component, as in the example below. It's also recommended that you assign the wrapped hook to a variable name starting with `use`, as per the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html#extracting-a-custom-hook).

</Alert>


```javascript {2-10, 15-21, 26, 29-31}
import React from "react";
import {
  createRoutesFromChildren,
  matchRoutes,
  useLocation,
  useNavigationType,
  useRoutes,
} from "react-router";

import { wrapUseRoutes } from "@sentry/react";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    Sentry.reactRouterV7BrowserTracingIntegration({
      useEffect: React.useEffect,
      useLocation,
      useNavigationType,
      createRoutesFromChildren,
      matchRoutes,
    }),
  ],
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

const useSentryRoutes = wrapUseRoutesV7(useRoutes);

function App() {
  return useSentryRoutes([
    // your routes...
  ]);
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <App />
  </BrowserRouter>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

Now, Sentry should generate `pageload`/`navigation` transactions with parameterized transaction names (for example, `/teams/:teamid/user/:userid`), where applicable. This is only needed at the top level of your app, rather than how v4/v5 required wrapping every `<Route/>` you wanted parametrized.


### Custom Error Boundaries

When using `react-router`, errors thrown inside route elements will only be re-thrown in **development mode** while using [`strict mode`](https://react.dev/reference/react/StrictMode). In production, these errors won't be surfaced unless manually captured. If you **don't** have a custom error boundary in place, `react-router` will create a default one that "swallows" all errors.

<Note>
Note, that this only applies to render method and lifecycle errors since React doesn't need error boundaries to handle errors in event handlers.
</Note>

To send errors to Sentry while using a custom error boundary, use the `Sentry.captureException` method:


```jsx {11, 28}
// router setup
const sentryCreateBrowserRouter = wrapCreateBrowserRouterV7(createBrowserRouter);
const router = sentryCreateBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <YourLayout />,
    children: [
      {
        path: "",
        element: <Outlet />,
        errorElement: <YourCustomRootErrorBoundary />,
        children: [
          // other routes ... 
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
]);

// error boundary
import { useRouteError } from "react-router-dom";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";

export function YourCustomRootErrorBoundary() {
  const error = useRouteError() as Error;

  React.useEffect(() => {
    Sentry.captureException(error);
  }, [error]);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Ouch!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

```
