<Alert level="info" title="Looking for framework mode?">
  React Router v7 (framework mode) is currently in experimental Alpha, check out
  the docs [here](/platforms/javascript/guides/react-router/).
</Alert>
Apply the following setup steps based on your routing method and create a
[custom error boundary](#set-up-a-custom-error-boundary) to make sure Sentry
automatically captures rendering errors:

<TableOfContents ignoreIds={["set-up-a-custom-error-boundary", "next-steps"]} />

## Usage with `createBrowserRouter` or `createMemoryRouter`

To instrument your React Router, update your `Sentry.browserTracingIntegration` to `Sentry.reactRouterV7BrowserTracingIntegration` within `Sentry.init` and provide the required React hooks and router functions. Then, wrap the router instance created by `createBrowserRouter` or `createMemoryRouter` with one of the following functions:

- Use `Sentry.wrapCreateBrowserRouterV7` for [`createBrowserRouter`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/routers/create-browser-router) and [`createHashRouter`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/routers/create-hash-router)
- Use `Sentry.wrapCreateMemoryRouterV7` for [`createMemoryRouter`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/routers/create-memory-router) (introduced in SDK version `8.50.0`)

```javascript {2-8, 15-21, 26-33}
import React from "react";
import {
  createBrowserRouter,
  createRoutesFromChildren,
  matchRoutes,
  useLocation,
  useNavigationType,
} from "react-router";

import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    Sentry.reactRouterV7BrowserTracingIntegration({
      useEffect: React.useEffect,
      useLocation,
      useNavigationType,
      createRoutesFromChildren,
      matchRoutes,
    }),
  ],
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

const sentryCreateBrowserRouter =
  Sentry.wrapCreateBrowserRouterV7(createBrowserRouter);

const router = sentryCreateBrowserRouter([
  // your routes...
]);
```

## Usage With `<Routes />` Component

If you're using the `<Routes />` component to define your routes, update your `Sentry.browserTracingIntegration` to `Sentry.reactRouterV7BrowserTracingIntegration` inside `Sentry.init` and provide the required React hooks and router functions. Then, wrap `<Routes />` using `Sentry.withSentryReactRouterV7Routing`. This creates a higher order component, which will enable Sentry to reach your router context. You can also use `Sentry.withSentryReactRouterV7Routing` for routes inside `BrowserRouter`, `MemoryRouter`, and `HashRouter` components.

```javascript {3-11, 18-24, 29, 33-35}
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import {
  Routes,
  Route,
  BrowserRouter,
  useLocation,
  useNavigationType,
  createRoutesFromChildren,
  matchRoutes,
} from "react-router";

import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    Sentry.reactRouterV7BrowserTracingIntegration({
      useEffect: React.useEffect,
      useLocation,
      useNavigationType,
      createRoutesFromChildren,
      matchRoutes,
    }),
  ],
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

const SentryRoutes = Sentry.withSentryReactRouterV7Routing(Routes);

ReactDOM.render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <SentryRoutes>
      <Route path="/" element={<div>Home</div>} />
    </SentryRoutes>
  </BrowserRouter>
);
```

This wrapper is only needed at the top level of your app, unlike React Router v4/v5, which required wrapping every `<Route />` you wanted parametrized.

## Usage With `useRoutes` Hook

If you specify your route definitions as an object to the [`useRoutes` hook](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/hooks/use-routes), update your `Sentry.browserTracingIntegration` to `Sentry.reactRouterV7BrowserTracingIntegration` inside `Sentry.init` and provide the required React hooks and router functions. Then, use `Sentry.wrapUseRoutesV7` to create a patched `useRoutes` hook that instruments your routes with Sentry.

<Alert level="warning" title="Important">
Call `wrapUseRoutesV7` outside of a React component, as in the example below. We also recommend that you assign the wrapped hook to a variable starting with `use`, as per [React's documentation](https://react.dev/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks#hook-names-always-start-with-use).

</Alert>

```javascript {2-10, 15-21, 26, 29-31}
import React from "react";
import {
  createRoutesFromChildren,
  matchRoutes,
  useLocation,
  useNavigationType,
  useRoutes,
} from "react-router";

import { wrapUseRoutes } from "@sentry/react";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    Sentry.reactRouterV7BrowserTracingIntegration({
      useEffect: React.useEffect,
      useLocation,
      useNavigationType,
      createRoutesFromChildren,
      matchRoutes,
    }),
  ],
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

const useSentryRoutes = wrapUseRoutesV7(useRoutes);

function App() {
  return useSentryRoutes([
    // your routes...
  ]);
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <App />
  </BrowserRouter>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

Now, Sentry should generate `pageload`/`navigation` transactions with parameterized transaction names (for example, `/teams/:teamid/user/:userid`), where applicable. This is only needed at the top level of your app, unlike React Router v4/v5, which required wrapping every `<Route />` you wanted parametrized.

## Set Up a Custom Error Boundary

When using `react-router`, errors thrown inside route elements will only be re-thrown in **development mode** while using [`strict mode`](https://react.dev/reference/react/StrictMode).\
In production, these errors won't surface unless captured manually. If you **don't** have a custom error boundary in place, `react-router` will create a default one that "swallows" all errors.\
Hence, to capture these errors with Sentry in production, we strongly recommend to implement a custom error boundary.

To send errors to Sentry while using a custom error boundary, use the `Sentry.captureException` method:

```jsx {11, 28}
// router setup
const sentryCreateBrowserRouter = wrapCreateBrowserRouterV7(createBrowserRouter);
const router = sentryCreateBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: <YourLayout />,
    children: [
      {
        path: "",
        element: <Outlet />,
        errorElement: <YourCustomRootErrorBoundary />,
        children: [
          // other routes ...
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
]);

// error boundary
import { useRouteError } from "react-router-dom";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";

export function YourCustomRootErrorBoundary() {
  const error = useRouteError() as Error;

  React.useEffect(() => {
    Sentry.captureException(error);
  }, [error]);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Ouch!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

```
