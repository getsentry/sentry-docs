_(Available in version 5.21.0 and above)_

React Router support is included in the `@sentry/react` package since version `5.21.0`.

<Alert level="info" title="Note">

The React Router integration is designed to work with Sentry Tracing. Please see [Set Up Tracing with React](/platforms/javascript/guides/react/tracing/) for more details on how to set up and install the SDK.

</Alert>

The React Router instrumentation uses the React Router library to create `pageload/navigation` transactions to ensure you collect meaningful performance data about the health of your page loads and associated requests.

We support integrations for React Router 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.
