_(Available in version 5.21.0 and above)_

React Router support is included in the `@sentry/react` package since version `5.21.0`.

<Alert level="info" title="Note">

The React Router integration is designed to work with Sentry Tracing. Please see [Set Up Tracing with React](/platforms/javascript/guides/react/tracing/) for more details on how to set up and install the SDK.

</Alert>

The React Router instrumentation uses the React Router library to create `pageload/navigation` transactions to ensure you collect meaningful performance data about the health of your page loads and associated requests.

We support integrations for React Router 3, 4, 5, and 6.

## React Router v6

_(Available in version 7 and above)_

To use React Router v6 with Sentry:

Add `Sentry.reactRouterV6BrowserTracingIntegration` instead of the regular `Sentry.browserTracingIntegration` and provide the functions it needs to enable performance tracing:

    - `useEffect` hook from `react`
    - `useLocation` and `useNavigationType` hooks from `react-router-dom`
    - `createRoutesFromChildren` and `matchRoutes` functions from `react-router-dom` or `react-router` packages.

<Alert level="warning">

Make sure `Sentry.reactRouterV6BrowserTracingIntegration` is initialized by your `Sentry.init` call, before you wrap `<Routes />` component or `useRoutes` hook. Otherwise, the routing instrumentation may not work properly.

</Alert>

### Usage with React Router 6.4 Data API

_(Available in version 7.21.0 and above)_

If you choose to create your router instance with [`createBrowserRouter`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/routers/create-browser-router) from the `react-router-dom` package, you can use `Sentry.wrapCreateBrowserRouter` to wrap it with the instrumentation:

<SignInNote />

```javascript
import { createBrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    Sentry.reactRouterV6BrowserTracingIntegration({
      useEffect: React.useEffect,
      useLocation,
      useNavigationType,
      createRoutesFromChildren,
      matchRoutes,
    }),
  ],
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

const sentryCreateBrowserRouter =
  Sentry.wrapCreateBrowserRouter(createBrowserRouter);

const router = sentryCreateBrowserRouter([
  // ...
]);
```

<Alert level="warning" title="Note">

You can instrument [`createMemoryRouter`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/routers/create-memory-router) and [`createHashRouter`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/routers/create-hash-router) using the `wrapCreateBrowserRouter` function.

</Alert>

### Usage With `<Routes />` Component

If you're using the `<Routes />` component from `react-router-dom` to define your routes, wrap [`Routes`](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/api#routes-and-route) using `Sentry.withSentryReactRouterV6Routing`. This creates a higher order component, which will enable Sentry to reach your router context. You can also use `Sentry.withSentryReactRouterV6Routing` for `Routes` inside `BrowserRouter`. `MemoryRouter`, and `HashRouter` components:

<SignInNote />

```javascript
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import {
  Routes,
  Route,
  BrowserRouter,
  useLocation,
  useNavigationType,
  createRoutesFromChildren,
  matchRoutes,
} from "react-router-dom";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    Sentry.reactRouterV6BrowserTracingIntegration({
      useEffect: React.useEffect,
      useLocation,
      useNavigationType,
      createRoutesFromChildren,
      matchRoutes,
    }),
  ],
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

const SentryRoutes = Sentry.withSentryReactRouterV6Routing(Routes);

ReactDOM.render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <SentryRoutes>
      <Route path="/" element={<div>Home</div>} />
    </SentryRoutes>
  </BrowserRouter>
);
```

This is only needed at the top level of your app, rather than how v4/v5 required wrapping every `<Route/>` you wanted parametrized.

### Usage With `useRoutes` Hook

_(Available in version 7.12.1 and above)_

If you specify your route definitions as an object to the [`useRoutes` hook](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/hooks/use-routes), use `Sentry.wrapUseRoutes` to create a patched `useRoutes` hook that instruments your routes with Sentry.

<Alert level="warning">

`wrapUseRoutes` should be called outside of a React component, as in the example below. It's also recommended that you assign the wrapped hook to a variable name starting with `use`, as per the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html#extracting-a-custom-hook).

</Alert>

<SignInNote />

```javascript
import {
  createRoutesFromChildren,
  matchRoutes,
  useLocation,
  useNavigationType,
  useRoutes,
} from "react-router-dom";
import { wrapUseRoutes } from "@sentry/react";
import { useEffect } from "react";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    Sentry.reactRouterV6BrowserTracingIntegration({
      useEffect,
      useLocation,
      useNavigationType,
      createRoutesFromChildren,
      matchRoutes,
    }),
  ],
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

const useSentryRoutes = wrapUseRoutes(useRoutes);

function App() {
  return useSentryRoutes([
    // ...
  ]);
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <App />
  </BrowserRouter>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

Now, Sentry should generate `pageload`/`navigation` transactions with parameterized transaction names (for example, `/teams/:teamid/user/:userid`), where applicable. This is only needed at the top level of your app, rather than how v4/v5 required wrapping every `<Route/>` you wanted parametrized.

## React Router v4/v5

Make sure you use a `Router` component combined with `createBrowserHistory` (or equivalent).

### Parameterized Transaction Names

To get parameterized transaction names (for example, `/teams/:teamid/user/:userid` instead of `/teams/123/user/345`), you must explicitly set the routes you want parameterized. That's because there is no static route config that the SDK can use in React Router v4/v5.

We recommend you use the `withSentryRouting` higher order component to create a `SentryRoute` component that will update the match path on render.

<SignInNote />

```javascript
import {Route, Router, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
import { createBrowserHistory } from 'history';

import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react';

// Create Custom Sentry Route component
const SentryRoute = Sentry.withSentryRouting(Route);

const history = createBrowserHistory();

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    Sentry.reactRouterV5BrowserTracingIntegration({ history }),
    // or
    Sentry.reactRouterV4BrowserTracingIntegration({ history }),
  ],

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

render() {
  return (
    <Router history={history}>
      <Switch>
        <SentryRoute path="/users/:userid" component={() => <div>UserId</div>} />
        <SentryRoute path="/users" component={() => <div>Users</div>} />
        <SentryRoute path="/" component={() => <div>Home</div>} />
      </Switch>
    </Router>
  );
}
```

If you don't want to wrap individual routes, you can still specify parameterized routes manually by passing an array of route config objects, per [react-router-config](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/master/packages/react-router-config), to the instrumentation function call. You'll also need to provide the `matchPath` function exported from the `react-router-dom` or `react-router` packages.

<SignInNote />

```javascript
import { Route, Router, Switch, matchPath } from 'react-router-dom';
import { createBrowserHistory } from 'history';

import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react';

const history = createBrowserHistory();

// Array of Route Config Objects
// Make sure the order of the routes is correct. The longest url under the same parent should be placed first and in decreasing order.
const routes = [{ path: '/users/:userid' }, { path: '/users' }, { path: '/' }];

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    Sentry.reactRouterV5BrowserTracingIntegration({
      history,
      routes,
      matchPath
    }),
  ],

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

// In your App render:
render() {
  return (
    <Router history={history}>
      <Switch>
         <Route path="/users/:userid" component={() => <div>UserId</div>} />
         <Route path="/users" component={() => <div>Users</div>} />
         <Route path="/" component={() => <div>Home</div>} />
      </Switch>
    </Router>
  );
}
```

## React Router v3

To use the router integration, import and set a custom routing instrumentation and pass it the history, your routes and a match function. React Router v3 support is maintained for React Router >= 3.2.0 and < 4.0.0.

<SignInNote />

```javascript
import * as Router from "react-router";

import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";

// Routes looks like this:
const routes = (
  <Route path="/">
    <Route path="organizations/">
      <Route path=":orgid" component={() => <div>OrgId</div>} />
      <Route path=":orgid/v1/:teamid" component={() => <div>Team</div>} />
    </Route>
  </Route>
);

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    Sentry.reactRouterV3BrowserTracingIntegration({
      history: Router.browserHistory,
      // Must be Plain Routes.
      routes: Router.createRoutes(routes),
      match: Router.match,
    }),
  ],

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```
