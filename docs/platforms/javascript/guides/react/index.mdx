<Alert>

Sentry's React SDK enables automatic reporting of errors and exceptions. The SDK is a wrapper around @sentry/browser, with added functionality related to React. All methods available in @sentry/browser can be imported from @sentry/react.

## Features

In addition to capturing errors, you can monitor interactions between multiple services or applications by [enabling tracing](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/). You can also get to the root of an error or performance issue faster, by watching a video-like reproduction of a user session with [session replay](/product/explore/session-replay/web/getting-started/).

Select which Sentry features you'd like to install in addition to Error Monitoring to get the corresponding installation and configuration instructions below.

## Install

<OnboardingOptionButtons options={["error-monitoring", "performance", "session-replay"]} />

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your application’s runtime.

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install @sentry/react --save
```

```bash {tabTitle:yarn}
yarn add @sentry/react
```

```bash {tabTitle:pnpm}
pnpm add @sentry/react
```

## Configure

Sentry supports multiple versions of React Router. To learn how to configure them, read the <PlatformLink to="/configuration/integrations/react-router/">React Router Integration</PlatformLink> docs.

Sentry should be initialized as early as possible in your application. We recommend putting the Sentry initialization code into its own file and including that file as the first import in your application entry point as shown in the example below:


```javascript {filename:instrument.js} {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "3-8, 13-21, 24-30", "session-replay": "22, 33-39"}}
import { useEffect } from "react";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";
import {
  createRoutesFromChildren,
  matchRoutes,
  useLocation,
  useNavigationType,
} from "react-router-dom";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    // See docs for support of different versions of variation of react router
    // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/react/configuration/integrations/react-router/
    Sentry.reactRouterV6BrowserTracingIntegration({
      useEffect,
      useLocation,
      useNavigationType,
      createRoutesFromChildren,
      matchRoutes,
    }),
    Sentry.replayIntegration(),
  ],

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for tracing.
  // Learn more at
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/options/#traces-sample-rate
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,

  // Set `tracePropagationTargets` to control for which URLs trace propagation should be enabled
  tracePropagationTargets: [/^\//, /^https:\/\/yourserver\.io\/api/],

  // Capture Replay for 10% of all sessions,
  // plus for 100% of sessions with an error
  // Learn more at
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/session-replay/configuration/#general-integration-configuration
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

Include the Sentry initialization file as the first import statement:

```javascript
// Sentry initialization should be imported first!
import "./instrument";
import App from "./App";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

const container = document.getElementById(“app”);
const root = createRoot(container);
root.render(<App />);
```

Once this is done, all unhandled exceptions will be automatically captured by Sentry.

### React 19 Error Reporting

Starting with React 19, the `createRoot` and `hydrateRoot` methods from `react-dom` will expose error hooks that are used to capture errors automatically. To customize how errors are handled in specific error hooks, use the `Sentry.reactErrorHandler` function.

```javascript
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

const container = document.getElementById(“app”);
const root = createRoot(container, {
  // Callback called when an error is thrown and not caught by an ErrorBoundary.
  onUncaughtError: Sentry.reactErrorHandler((error, errorInfo) => {
    console.warn('Uncaught error', error, errorInfo.componentStack);
  }),
  // Callback called when React catches an error in an ErrorBoundary.
  onCaughtError: Sentry.reactErrorHandler(),
  // Callback called when React automatically recovers from errors.
  onRecoverableError: Sentry.reactErrorHandler(),
});
root.render();
```

These hooks apply to all React components that are mounted to the container which is passed onto `createRoot`/`hydrateRoot`. For more precise control over error handling, we recommend adding an `ErrorBoundary` component to your application.

### Add Error Boundary

If you're using React 16 or above, you can use the [Error Boundary](features/error-boundary/) component to automatically send JavaScript errors from inside a component tree to Sentry, and set a fallback UI.

### Set Up React Router

The React Router integration is designed to work with our tracing package. Learn more about set up for our [React Router Integration](configuration/integrations/react-router/).

### Apply Redux

To apply Sentry to Redux, learn more about the [Redux Integration](configuration/integrations/redux/) and its options.

## Verify

This snippet includes an intentional error, so you can test that everything is working as soon as you set it up.

```javascript
<button
  type="button"
  onClick={() => {
    throw new Error("Sentry Test Error");
  }}
>
  Break the world
</button>
```

<Alert>

Learn more about manually capturing an error or message in our <PlatformLink to="/usage/">Usage documentation</PlatformLink>.

</Alert>

To view and resolve the recorded error, log into [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and select your project. Clicking on the error's title will open a page where you can see detailed information and mark it as resolved.
