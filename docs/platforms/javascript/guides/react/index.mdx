## Step 1: Install

Choose the features you want to configure, and this guide will show you how:

<OnboardingOptionButtons
  options={["error-monitoring", "performance", "session-replay"]}
/>

<Expandable title="Want to learn more about these features?">

- [**Issues**](/product/issues) (always enabled): Sentry's core error monitoring product that automatically reports errors,
  uncaught exceptions, and unhandled rejections. If you have something that
  looks like an exception, Sentry can capture it.
- [**Tracing**](/product/tracing): Track software performance while seeing the
  impact of errors across multiple systems. For example, distributed tracing
  allows you to follow a request from the frontend to the backend and back.
- [**Session Replay**](/product/explore/session-replay/web):
  Get to the root cause of an issue faster by viewing a video-like reproduction
  of what was happening in the user's browser before, during, and after the
  problem.

### Install the Sentry SDK

Run the command for your preferred package manager to add the Sentry SDK to your application:

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install @sentry/react --save
```

```bash {tabTitle:yarn}
yarn add @sentry/react
```

```bash {tabTitle:pnpm}
pnpm add @sentry/react
```

## Step 2: Configure

Sentry supports multiple versions of React Router. To learn how to configure them, read the <PlatformLink to="/configuration/integrations/react-router/">React Router Integration</PlatformLink> docs.

### Initialize the Sentry SDK

To import and initialize Sentry, create a file in your project's root directory, for example, `instrument.js`, and add the following code:

```javascript {filename:instrument.js} {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "3-8, 13-21, 24-30", "session-replay": "22, 33-39"}}
import { useEffect } from "react";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";
import {
  createRoutesFromChildren,
  matchRoutes,
  useLocation,
  useNavigationType,
} from "react-router-dom";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    // See docs for support of different versions of variation of react router
    // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/react/configuration/integrations/react-router/
    Sentry.reactRouterV6BrowserTracingIntegration({
      useEffect,
      useLocation,
      useNavigationType,
      createRoutesFromChildren,
      matchRoutes,
    }),
    Sentry.replayIntegration(),
  ],

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for tracing.
  // Learn more at
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/options/#traces-sample-rate
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,

  // Set `tracePropagationTargets` to control for which URLs trace propagation should be enabled
  tracePropagationTargets: [/^\//, /^https:\/\/yourserver\.io\/api/],

  // Capture Replay for 10% of all sessions,
  // plus for 100% of sessions with an error
  // Learn more at
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/session-replay/configuration/#general-integration-configuration
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

### Apply Instrumentation to Your App

Initialize Sentry as early as possible in your application. We recommend putting the import of your initialization code as the first import in your app's entry point:

```javascript
// Sentry initialization should be imported first!
import "./instrument";
import App from "./App";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

const container = document.getElementById(“app”);
const root = createRoot(container);
root.render(<App />);
```

## Step 3: Capture React Errors

To make sure Sentry captures all your app's errors, configure error handling based on your React version.

### Configure Error Hooks (React 19+)

The `createRoot` and `hydrateRoot` methods provide error hooks to capture errors automatically. These hooks apply to all React components mounted to the root container.
Integrate Sentry with these hooks and customize error handling:

```javascript
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";

const container = document.getElementById(“app”);
const root = createRoot(container, {
  // Callback called when an error is thrown and not caught by an ErrorBoundary.
  onUncaughtError: Sentry.reactErrorHandler((error, errorInfo) => {
    console.warn('Uncaught error', error, errorInfo.componentStack);
  }),
  // Callback called when React catches an error in an ErrorBoundary.
  onCaughtError: Sentry.reactErrorHandler(),
  // Callback called when React automatically recovers from errors.
  onRecoverableError: Sentry.reactErrorHandler(),
});
root.render();
```

### Add Error Boundary Components (React \<19)

Use the [`ErrorBoundary`](features/error-boundary/) component to automatically send errors from specific component trees to Sentry and provide a fallback UI:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react";

<Sentry.ErrorBoundary fallback={<p>An error has occurred</p>}>
  <Example />
</Sentry.ErrorBoundary>;
```

<Alert level="info">
  To capture errors manually with your own error boundary, use the
  `captureReactException` function as described
  [here](features/error-boundary/#manually-capturing-errors).
</Alert>

## Step 4: Set Up React Router

The React Router integration is designed to work with our tracing package. Learn more about set up for our [React Router Integration](configuration/integrations/react-router/).

To capture Redux state data, use `Sentry.createReduxEnhancer` when initializing your Redux store.

  ## Step 6: Verify Your Setup
</OnboardingOption>

Let's test your setup and confirm that Sentry is working correctly and sending data to your Sentry project.

Add the following test button to one of your pages, which will trigger an error that Sentry will capture when you click it:

```javascript
<button
  type="button"
  onClick={() => {
    throw new Error("Sentry Test Error");
  }}
>
  Break the world
</button>
```

Open the page in a browser (for most React applications, this will be at localhost) and click the button to trigger a frontend error.

### View Captured Data in Sentry

Now, head over to your project on [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io/) to view the collected data (it takes a couple of moments for the data to appear).

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-verify-locate-data" />

## Next Steps

At this point, you should have integrated Sentry into your React application and should already be sending data to your Sentry project.

Now's a good time to customize your setup and look into more advanced topics. Our next recommended steps for you are:

- Extend Sentry to your backend using one of our [SDKs](/)
- Continue to <PlatformLink to="/configuration">customize your configuration</PlatformLink>
- Make use of <PlatformLink to="/features/redux">React-specific features</PlatformLink>
- Learn how to <PlatformLink to="/usage">manually capture errors</PlatformLink>
- Avoid ad-blockers with <PlatformLink to="/troubleshooting/#using-the-tunnel-option">tunneling</PlatformLink>
