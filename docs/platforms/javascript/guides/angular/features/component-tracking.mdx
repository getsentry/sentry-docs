title: Track Angular Components
description: "Learn how Sentry's Angular SDK allows you to monitor the rendering performance of your application and its components."

Sentry's Angular SDK offers a feature to monitor the performance of your Angular components: Component Tracking. Enabling this feature provides you with spans in your transactions that show the initialization and update cycles of your Angular components. This allows you to drill down into how your components are behaving so you can identify slow initializations or frequent updates, which might have an impact on your app's performance.

<Alert>

To set up component tracking, you need to configure performance monitoring. For details on how to do this, check out our [Performance documentation](/platforms/javascript/guides/angular/performance/).

</Alert>

To track your components as part of your transactions, use any (or a combination) of the following options.

## Using the `trace` directive

Our `TraceDirective` tracks a duration between the `OnInit` and `AfterViewInit` lifecycle hooks in your component template. It adds spans called **`ui.angular.init`** to the currently active transaction that allows you to track specific individual instances of your components. If you want to track all instances instead, use [`TraceClass`](#using-traceclass).

Import `TraceModule` either globally in your application's `app.module.ts` file or in the module(s) in which
you want to track your components:

```typescript {filename:app.module.ts} {1,5}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/angular";

@NgModule({
  // ...
  imports: [Sentry.TraceModule],
  // ...
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Then, in your component's template, add the directive to all components you want to track. Remember to give the `trace` attribute a name, which will be shown in the span's description:

```html {filename:app.component.(ts|html)}
<app-header trace="header"></app-header>
<articles-list trace="articles-list"></articles-list>
<app-footer trace="footer"></app-footer>
```

## Using `TraceClass`

The `TraceClass` decorator tracks the duration between the `OnInit` and `AfterViewInit` lifecycle hooks in components. It adds spans called **`ui.angular.init`** to the currently active transaction. In contrast to the [`trace` directive](#using-the-trace-directive), `TraceClassDecorator` tracks all instances of the component(s) you add it to, creating spans for each component instance.

Just add `TraceClass` decorator with a component name to the components you want to track:

```typescript {filename:header.component.ts} {2,8}
import { Component } from "@angular/core";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/angular";

@Component({
  selector: "app-header",
  templateUrl: "./header.component.html",
})
@Sentry.TraceClass({ name: "Header" })
export class HeaderComponent {
  // ...
}
```

Note: Due to code minification in production builds, you need to pass a `name` property to the `TraceClass` decorator. Otherwise, spans will refer to the component as `<unnamed>`.

## Using `TraceMethod`

The `TraceMethod` decorator tracks specific component lifecycle hooks as point-in-time spans. The added spans are called **`ui.angular.[methodname]`** (like, `ui.angular.ngOnChanges`). For example, you can use this decorator to track how often component changes are detected:

```typescript {filename:login.component.ts} {2,9}
import { Component, OnInit } from "@angular/core";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/angular";

@Component({
  selector: "app-login",
  templateUrl: "./login.component.html",
})
export class LoginComponent implements OnChanges {
  @Sentry.TraceMethod({ name: "Login.ngOnChanges" })
  ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges) {
    // ...
  }
}
```

Note: Due to code minification in production builds, you need to pass a `name` property to the `TraceMethod` decorator. Otherwise, created spans will refer to the component as `<unnamed>`.

## Advanced Usage

You can combine our component tracking utilities and track the bootstrapping duration of your app.

### Combining Component Tracking Utilities

To get the best insights into your components' performance, you can combine `TraceDirective`, `TraceClassDecorator`, and `TraceMethodDecorator`. This allows you to track component initialization durations as well as arbitrary lifecycle events, such as change and destroy events:

```typescript {filename:user-card.component.ts} {2,8,10,13}
import { Component, OnInit } from "@angular/core";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/angular";

@Component({
  selector: "app-user-card",
  templateUrl: "./user-card.component.html",
})
@Sentry.TraceClass()
export class UserCardComponent implements OnChanges, OnDestroy {
  @Sentry.TraceMethod()
  ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges) {}

  @Sentry.TraceMethod()
  ngOnDestroy() {}
}
```

Use the `trace` directive if you only want to track components in certain instances or locations:

```html {filename: user-card.component.html} {2,5}
<div>
  <app-icon trace="user-icon">user</app-icon>
  <label>{{ user.name }}</label>
  <!--...-->
  <app-button trace="save-user">Save</app-button>
</div>
```

### Track Angular Bootstrapping

You can add your own custom spans using `startSpan()`. For example, you can track the duration of the Angular bootstrapping process to find out how long your app takes to bootstrap on your users' devices:

```typescript {filename:main.ts} {3,9-20}
import { enableProdMode } from "@angular/core";
import { platformBrowserDynamic } from "@angular/platform-browser-dynamic";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/angular";

import { AppModule } from "./app/app.module";

// ...

Sentry.startSpan(
  {
    name: "bootstrap-angular-application",
    op: "ui.angular.bootstrap",
  },
  async () => {
    await platformBrowserDynamic()
      .bootstrapModule(AppModule)
      .catch((err) => console.error(err));
  }
);
```
