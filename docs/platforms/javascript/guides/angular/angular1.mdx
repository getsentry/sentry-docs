If you're using `AngularJS 1.x`, you can use Sentry's AngularJS integration.

<Alert level="warning" title="Discontinued support for AngularJS 1.x">

From version 7 onwards, the Sentry JavaScript SDK will not support AngularJS 1.x. Please use version 6.x of the SDK if you want to use Sentry in combination with AngularJs 1.x.

</Alert>

### Install

Install `@sentry/browser` and `@sentry/integrations` using `yarn` or `npm`:

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install --save @sentry/browser@6 @sentry/integrations@6
```

```bash {tabTitle:Yarn}
yarn add @sentry/browser@6 @sentry/integrations@6
```

and afterwards using it like this:

<SignInNote />

```javascript
import angular from "angular";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";
import { Angular as AngularIntegration } from "@sentry/integrations";

// Make sure to call Sentry.init after importing AngularJS.
// You can also pass {angular: AngularInstance} to the Integrations.Angular() constructor.
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [new AngularIntegration()],
});

// Finally require ngSentry as a dependency in your application module.
angular.module("yourApplicationModule", ["ngSentry"]);
```

If you're using the CDN version of the SDK, Sentry provides a standalone file for every integration:

<SignInNote />

```html
<script

  crossorigin="anonymous"
></script>

<!-- If you include the integration it will be available under Sentry.Integrations.Angular -->
<script
  src="https://browser.sentry-cdn.com/6.19.7/angular.min.js"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
></script>

<script>
  Sentry.init({
    dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    integrations: [new Sentry.Integrations.Angular()],
  });
</script>
```
