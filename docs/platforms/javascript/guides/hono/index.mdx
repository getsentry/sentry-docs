This guide explains how to set up Sentry in your Hono application.

If you don't already have an account and a Sentry project established, sign up for [Sentry](https://sentry.io/signup/) for free, then return to this page.

## Features

In addition to capturing errors, you can monitor interactions between multiple services or applications by [enabling tracing](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/). You can also collect and analyze performance profiles from real users with [profiling](/product/explore/profiling/). Note that profiling currently only works in the Node.js runtime.

Select which Sentry features you'd like to install in addition to Error Monitoring to get the corresponding installation and configuration instructions below.

## Setup

npm install @sentry/node --save
```

```bash {tabTitle:yarn}
