_Import name: `Sentry.breadcrumbsIntegration`_

This integration is enabled by default. You can also [modify default integrations](./../#modifying-default-integrations).

The `breadcrumbsIntegration` wraps native APIs to capture breadcrumbs.
By default, the Sentry SDK wraps all APIs. You can opt out of capturing breadcrumbs for specific parts of your application (for example, you could say don't capture `console.log` calls as breadcrumbs) via the options below.

## Options

### `console`

_Type: `boolean`_

Log calls to `console.log`, `console.debug`, and so on.

### `fetch`

_Type: `boolean`_

Log HTTP requests done with the Fetch API.

### `sentry`

_Type: `boolean`_

Log whenever we send an event to the server.
