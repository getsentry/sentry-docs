<Alert>

  The Deno SDK is currently in Beta.

</Alert>

The minimum supported Deno version is 2.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-prerequisites" />

## Configure

Configuration should happen as early as possible in your application's lifecycle.


In addition to capturing errors, you can monitor interactions between multiple services or applications by [enabling tracing](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/).

Select which Sentry features you'd like to install in addition to Error Monitoring to get the corresponding installation and configuration instructions below.

<OnboardingOptionButtons options={["error-monitoring", "performance"]} />

```javascript {tabTitle: Deno}
import * as Sentry from "npm:@sentry/deno";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  
  // Adds request headers and IP for users, for more info visit:
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/deno/configuration/options/#sendDefaultPii
  sendDefaultPii: true,
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ performance

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for performance monitoring.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  // Learn more at
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/options/#traces-sample-rate
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ performance
});
```

```javascript {tabTitle: npm}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/deno";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ performance

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for performance monitoring.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  // Learn more at
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/options/#traces-sample-rate
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ performance
});
```
To ensure the SDK can send events, you should enable network access for your
ingestion domain:

```bash
deno run --allow-net=___ORG_INGEST_DOMAIN___ index.ts
```

## Allow access to your source files

To ensure the SDK can include your source code in stack traces, you should enable read access for your source files:

```bash
deno run --allow-read=./src index.ts
```

## Verify

This snippet includes an intentional error, so you can test that everything is working as soon as you set it up.

Verify your setup by adding the following snippet anywhere in your code and running it:

```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
  throw new Error();
});
```

<Alert>

Learn more about manually capturing an error or message in our <PlatformLink to="/usage/">Usage documentation</PlatformLink>.

</Alert>

To view and resolve the recorded error, log into [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and select your project. Clicking on the error's title will open a page where you can see detailed information and mark it as resolved.
