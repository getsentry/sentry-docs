## Install

<OnboardingOptionButtons
  options={["error-monitoring", "performance", "profiling"]}
/>

Add `@sentry/google-cloud-serverless` as a dependency to `package.json`:

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-install" />

## Configure

To set up Sentry for a Google Cloud Function:

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-config" />

<Alert level="warning" title="Note">

Sentry JavaScript Serverless SDK does not support Cloud Functions for Firebase at the moment.

</Alert>

Check out Sentry's [GCP sample apps](https://github.com/getsentry/examples/tree/master/gcp-cloud-functions/node) for detailed examples. Refer to the [JavaScript docs](/platforms/javascript/) for more configuration options.

## Behavior

With the Google Cloud Functions integration enabled, the Node SDK will:

- Automatically report all events from your Cloud Functions.
- Allows you to <PlatformLink to="/configuration/sampling/#configuring-the-transaction-sample-rate">modify the transaction sample rate</PlatformLink> using <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" />.
- Issue reports automatically include:
  - A link to the Stackdriver logs
  - Function details
  - sys.argv for the function
  - Function execution time
  - Function version
- Sentry holds the thread for up to two seconds to report errors. You can change flush time limit by defining a `flushTimeout` value in the handler options
