<Alert>
  This guide is for version 8.0.0 and up of `@sentry/google-cloud-serverless`.
</Alert>

## Features

In addition to capturing errors, you can monitor interactions between multiple services or applications by [enabling tracing](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/). You can also collect and analyze performance profiles from real users with [profiling](/product/explore/profiling/).

Select which Sentry features you'd like to install in addition to Error Monitoring to get the corresponding installation and configuration instructions below.

## Install

<OnboardingOptionButtons
  options={["error-monitoring", "performance", "profiling"]}
/>

Add `@sentry/google-cloud-serverless` as a dependency to `package.json`:

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-install" />

## Configure

To set up Sentry for a Google Cloud Function:


```javascript {tabTitle:Http functions} {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "5-9"}}
const Sentry = require("@sentry/google-cloud-serverless");

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // Add Tracing by setting tracesSampleRate and adding integration
  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100% of transactions
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  // Learn more at
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/options/#traces-sample-rate
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

exports.helloHttp = Sentry.wrapHttpFunction((req, res) => {
  throw new Error("oh, hello there!");
});
```

```javascript {tabTitle:Background functions} {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "5"}}
const Sentry = require("@sentry/google-cloud-serverless");

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

exports.helloEvents = Sentry.wrapEventFunction(
  (data, context, callback) => {
    throw new Error("oh, hello there!");
  }
);
```

```javascript {tabTitle:CloudEvent functions} {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "5"}}
const Sentry = require("@sentry/google-cloud-serverless");

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

exports.helloEvents = Sentry.wrapCloudEventFunction(
  (context, callback) => {
    throw new Error("oh, hello there!");
  }
);
```

<Alert level="warning" title="Note">

Sentry JavaScript Serverless SDK does not support Cloud Functions for Firebase at the moment.

</Alert>

Check out Sentry's [GCP sample apps](https://github.com/getsentry/examples/tree/master/gcp-cloud-functions/node) for detailed examples. Refer to the [JavaScript docs](/platforms/javascript/) for more configuration options.

## Behavior

With the Google Cloud Functions integration enabled, the Node SDK will:

- Automatically report all events from your Cloud Functions.
- Allows you to <PlatformLink to="/configuration/sampling/#configuring-the-transaction-sample-rate">modify the transaction sample rate</PlatformLink> using <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" />.
- Issue reports automatically include:
  - A link to the Stackdriver logs
  - Function details
  - sys.argv for the function
  - Function execution time
  - Function version
- Sentry holds the thread for up to two seconds to report errors. You can change flush time limit by defining a `flushTimeout` value in the handler options
