<Alert level="warning" title="Important">
  This SDK is currently in **beta**. Beta features are still in progress and may
  have bugs. Please reach out on
  [GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/new/choose) if

## Install

<SplitLayout>
<SplitSection>
<SplitSectionText>

To install Sentry using the installation wizard, run the command on the right within your project directory.

The wizard guides you through the setup process, asking you to enable additional (optional) Sentry features for your application beyond error monitoring.

This guide assumes that you enable all features and allow the wizard to create an example page and route. You can add or remove features at any time, but setting them up now will save you the effort of configuring them manually later.

<Expandable title="What does the installation wizard change inside your application?">

- Installs the `@sentry/react-router` package (and optionally `@sentry/profiling-node`)
- Reveals React Router entry point files (`entry.client.tsx` and `entry.server.tsx`) if not already visible
- Initializes Sentry in your client and server entry files with default configuration
- Creates `instrument.server.mjs` for server-side instrumentation
- Updates your `app/root.tsx` to capture errors in the error boundary
- Configures source map upload in `vite.config.ts` and `react-router.config.ts`
- Creates `.env.sentry-build-plugin` with an auth token to upload source maps (this file is automatically added to `.gitignore`)
- Creates example page and API route to help verify your Sentry setup

## Configure

If you prefer to configure Sentry manually, here are the configuration files the wizard would create:

In addition to capturing errors, you can monitor interactions between multiple services or applications by [enabling tracing](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/). You can also get to the root of an error or performance issue faster, by watching a video-like reproduction of a user session with [session replay](/product/explore/session-replay/web/getting-started/).

Select which Sentry features you'd like to install in addition to Error Monitoring to get the corresponding installation and configuration instructions below.

<OnboardingOptionButtons
  options={[
    "error-monitoring",
    "performance",
    "session-replay",
    "user-feedback",
    "logs",

      checked: false,
    },
  ]}

### Client-Side Configuration

The wizard creates a client configuration file that initializes the Sentry SDK in your browser.

The configuration includes your DSN (Data Source Name), which connects your app to your Sentry project, and enables the features you selected during installation.

</SplitSectionText>
<SplitSectionCode>

```tsx {tabTitle:Client} {filename:entry.client.tsx}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react-router";
import { startTransition, StrictMode } from "react";
import { hydrateRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import { HydratedRouter } from "react-router/dom";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // Adds request headers and IP for users, for more info visit:
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/react-router/configuration/options/#sendDefaultPii
  sendDefaultPii: true,

  integrations: [

    Sentry.feedbackIntegration({

    }),

startTransition(() => {
  hydrateRoot(

    <StrictMode>
      <HydratedRouter />
    </StrictMode>
  );
});

### Server-Side Configuration

The wizard also creates a server configuration file for Node.js runtime.

For more advanced configuration options or to set up Sentry manually, check out our [manual setup guide](/platforms/javascript/guides/react-router/manual-setup/).

<SplitSectionCode>

```js {tabTitle:Server} {filename:instrument.server.mjs}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react-router";
// ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ profiling
import { nodeProfilingIntegration } from "@sentry/profiling-node";
// ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ profiling

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // Adds request headers and IP for users, for more info visit:

## Verify Your Setup

If you haven't tested your Sentry configuration yet, let's do it now. You can confirm that Sentry is working properly and sending data to your Sentry project by using the example page created by the installation wizard:

1. Open the example page `/sentry-example-page` in your browser. For most React Router applications, this will be at localhost.
2. Observe the example page with a button that triggers test errors.

Clicking the button triggers an error that Sentry captures for you. The example also demonstrates how to test performance tracing.

<Alert level="success" title="Tip">

Don't forget to explore the example files' code in your project to understand what's happening after your button click.

</Alert>

### View Captured Data in Sentry

Now, head over to your project on [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io) to view the collected data (it takes a couple of moments for the data to appear).

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-browser-sandbox-warning" />

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-verify-locate-data" />

## Next Steps

At this point, you should have integrated Sentry into your React Router Framework application and should already be sending data to your Sentry project.

Now's a good time to customize your setup and look into more advanced topics.
Our next recommended steps for you are:

- Explore [practical guides](/guides/) on what to monitor, log, track, and investigate after setup
- Learn how to <PlatformLink to="/usage">manually capture errors</PlatformLink>
- Continue to <PlatformLink to="/configuration">customize your configuration</PlatformLink>
- Get familiar with [Sentry's product features](/product/) like tracing, insights, and alerts
