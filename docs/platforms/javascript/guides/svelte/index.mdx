<Alert>

  Sentry's Svelte SDK enables automatic reporting of errors and exceptions, as well as tracing for your client-side Svelte apps.

</Alert>

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-prerequisites" />

## Features

In addition to capturing errors, you can monitor interactions between multiple services or applications by [enabling tracing](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/). You can also get to the root of an error or performance issue faster, by watching a video-like reproduction of a user session with [session replay](/product/explore/session-replay/web/getting-started/).

Select which Sentry features you'd like to install in addition to Error Monitoring to get the corresponding installation and configuration instructions below.

## Install

<OnboardingOptionButtons options={["error-monitoring", "performance", "session-replay"]} />

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your applicationâ€™s runtime.

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install @sentry/svelte --save
```

```bash {tabTitle:yarn}
yarn add @sentry/svelte
```

```bash {tabTitle:pnpm}
pnpm add @sentry/svelte
```

## Configure

Configuration should happen as early as possible in your application's lifecycle.

To use the SDK, initialize it in your Svelte entry point before bootstrapping your app. In a typical Svelte project, that is your `main.js` or `main.ts` file.

```javascript {tabTitle: Svelte v5+} {filename: main.js} {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "16, 19-26", "session-replay": "17, 29-35"}}
import { mount } from "svelte";
import "./app.css";
import App from "./App.svelte";

import * as Sentry from "@sentry/svelte";

// Initialize the Sentry SDK here
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  
  // Adds request headers and IP for users, for more info visit:
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/svelte/configuration/options/#sendDefaultPii
  sendDefaultPii: true,
  
  integrations: [
    Sentry.browserTracingIntegration(),
    Sentry.replayIntegration(),
  ],

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for tracing.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  // Learn more at
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/options/#traces-sample-rate
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,

  // Set `tracePropagationTargets` to control for which URLs trace propagation should be enabled
  tracePropagationTargets: ["localhost", /^https:\/\/yourserver\.io\/api/],

  // Capture Replay for 10% of all sessions,
  // plus 100% of sessions with an error
  // Learn more at
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/session-replay/configuration/#general-integration-configuration
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,
});

const app = mount(App, {
  target: document.getElementById("app"),
});

export default app;
```

```javascript {tabTitle: Svelte v3-v4} {filename: main.js} {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "10, 13-20", "session-replay": "11, 23-29"}}
import "./app.css";
import App from "./App.svelte";

import * as Sentry from "@sentry/svelte";

// Initialize the Sentry SDK here
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    Sentry.browserTracingIntegration(),
    Sentry.replayIntegration(),
  ],

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for tracing.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  // Learn more at
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/options/#traces-sample-rate
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,

  // Set `tracePropagationTargets` to control for which URLs trace propagation should be enabled
  tracePropagationTargets: ["localhost", /^https:\/\/yourserver\.io\/api/],

  // Capture Replay for 10% of all sessions,
  // plus 100% of sessions with an error
  // Learn more at
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/session-replay/configuration/#general-integration-configuration
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,
});

const app = new App({
  target: document.getElementById("app"),
});

export default app;
```

Once you've done this, the SDK will automatically capture unhandled errors and promise rejections, and monitor performance in the client. You can also [manually capture errors](/platforms/javascript/guides/svelte/usage).

## Verify

This snippet includes an intentional error, so you can test that everything is working as soon as you set it up.

```jsx {tabTitle:Svelte v5+} {filename:SomeCmponent.svelte}
<button
  type="button"
  onclick={() => {
    throw new Error("Sentry Frontend Error");
  }}
>
  Throw error
</button>
```

```jsx {tabTitle:Svelte v3/v4} {filename:SomeCmponent.svelte}
<button
  type="button"
  on:click={() => {
    throw new Error("Sentry Frontend Error");
  }}
>
  Throw error
</button>
```

This snippet adds a button that throws an error in a Svelte component.

</Alert>

To view and resolve the recorded error, log into [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and select your project. Clicking on the error's title will open a page where you can see detailed information and mark it as resolved.
