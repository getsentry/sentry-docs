## How To Decide Which Run Method To Use

Depending on the concrete needs of your application and deployment, you may wonder which run method you should use.

### Why Choose `--require` Or `--import` Over A Top Level Import

Using [--require](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#-r---require-module) or [--import](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--importmodule) is the easiest way to guarantee that Sentry is imported and initialized before any other modules in your application, but it comes with drawbacks.

- **Using Node parameters**: There are many ways of running applications via Node and not everyone has the possibility to change their build steps to pass extra parameters to Node.

- **Using ECMAScript modules**: If `instrument.js` is an ECMAScript module, it must be loaded with [--import](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--importmodule) which is only supported from Node v18.19.0 onwards.

### Why Choose A Top Level Import Over `--require` Or `--import`

If you cannot run node with [--require](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#-r---require-module) or [--import](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--importmodule), add a top level import of `instrument.js` in your application.

The order of import
While using [--require](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#-r---require-module) or [--import](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--importmodule) guarantees that Sentry is imported and initialized before any other modules in your application, it comes with drawbacks.

- **Import order**: The order of import is important. It is essential that you call `Sentry.init` before you require any other modules in your application â€” otherwise, auto-instrumentation of these modules will _not_ work. Tools that sort imports could interfere with this.
