<Note>
This guide is for version 8.0.0 and up of `@sentry/node`.

## Install

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your application’s runtime. This means that you have to add `@sentry/node` as a runtime dependency to your application:

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install --save @sentry/node
```

```bash {tabTitle:Yarn}
yarn add @sentry/node
```

## Configure

Sentry should be initialized as early in your app as possible. It is essential that you call `Sentry.init` before you require any other modules in your application—otherwise, auto-instrumentation of these modules will _not_ work.

Once this is done, Sentry's Node SDK captures unhandled exceptions as well as tracing data for your application.

We recommend creating a file named `instrument.js` that imports and initializes Sentry.

If you set a `tracesSampleRate`, performance instrumentation will automatically be enabled for you. See <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation">Automatic Instrumentation</PlatformLink> to learn about all the things that the SDK automatically instruments for you.

You can also manually capture performance data—see <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation">Custom Instrumentation</PlatformLink> for details.

## Run

Adjust the Node.js call for your application to use the [--require](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#-r---require-module) or [--import](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--importmodule) parameter and point it at `instrument.js`

## Verify

This snippet includes an intentional error, so you can test that everything is working as soon as you set it up.
