## Install

<OnboardingOptionButtons
  options={["error-monitoring", "performance", "profiling"]}
/>

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your applicationâ€™s runtime. This means that you have to add `@sentry/node` as a runtime dependency to your application:

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-install" />

## Configure

To set up Sentry error logging for an Azure Function:

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-config" />

You can obtain the DSN using your Sentry account from your organization's _Settings > Projects > Client Keys (DSN)_ in the Sentry web UI.

Note: You need to call both `captureException` and `flush` for captured events to be successfully delivered to Sentry.

Check out Sentry's [Azure sample apps](https://github.com/getsentry/examples/tree/master/azure-functions/node) for detailed examples. Refer to the [JavaScript docs](/platforms/javascript/) for more configuration options.
