## Features

In addition to capturing errors, you can monitor interactions between multiple services or applications by [enabling tracing](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/). You can also collect and analyze performance profiles from real users with [profiling](/product/explore/profiling/).

Select which Sentry features you'd like to install in addition to Error Monitoring to get the corresponding installation and configuration instructions below.

## Install

<OnboardingOptionButtons options={["error-monitoring", "performance", "profiling"]} />

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your applicationâ€™s runtime. This means that you have to add `@sentry/node` as a runtime dependency to your application:

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-install" />

## Configure

To set up Sentry error logging for an Azure Function:

```javascript {tabTitle:async} {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "9-15", "profiling": "2, 6-8, 16-18"}}
const Sentry = require("@sentry/node");
const { nodeProfilingIntegration } = require("@sentry/profiling-node");

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    nodeProfilingIntegration(),
  ],

  // Add Performance Monitoring by setting tracesSampleRate
  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100% of transactions
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  // Learn more at
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/options/#traces-sample-rate
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,

  // Set sampling rate for profiling - this is relative to tracesSampleRate
  profilesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

module.exports = async function (context, req) {
  try {
    await notExistFunction();
  } catch (e) {
    Sentry.withScope((scope) => {
      scope.setSDKProcessingMetadata({ request: req });
      Sentry.captureException(e);
    });
    await Sentry.flush(2000);
  }

  context.res = {
    status: 200,
    body: "Hello from Azure Cloud Function!",
  };
};
```


You can obtain the DSN using your Sentry account from your organization's _Settings > Projects > Client Keys (DSN)_ in the Sentry web UI.

Note: You need to call both `captureException` and `flush` for captured events to be successfully delivered to Sentry.

Check out Sentry's [Azure sample apps](https://github.com/getsentry/examples/tree/master/azure-functions/node) for detailed examples. Refer to the [JavaScript docs](/platforms/javascript/) for more configuration options.
