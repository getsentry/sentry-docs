Vue 3 allows you to use multiple apps with the same Sentry SDK instance, as well as add more apps dynamically after the SDK has been already initialized.

### Multiple Apps

Pass all your initially created apps to the `app` option in `Sentry.init`:

```javascript {filename:main.js}
const appOne = Vue.createApp(App);
const appTwo = Vue.createApp(App);
const appThree = Vue.createApp(App);

Sentry.init({
  app: [appOne, appTwo, appThree],
});
```

### Dynamic Initialization

If some of your apps are initialized at a later point, you can add Sentry to them like so:

```javascript {filename:main.js}
// ...
const myLazyApp = createApp(MiscApp);

myLazyApp.mixin(Sentry.createTracingMixins({ trackComponents: true }));
Sentry.attachErrorHandler(myLazyApp);
```
