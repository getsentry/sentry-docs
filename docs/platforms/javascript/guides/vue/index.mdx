## Features

In addition to capturing errors, you can monitor interactions between multiple services or applications by [enabling tracing](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/). You can also get to the root of an error or performance issue faster, by watching a video-like reproduction of a user session with [session replay](/product/explore/session-replay/web/getting-started/).

Select which Sentry features you'd like to install in addition to Error Monitoring to get the corresponding installation and configuration instructions below.

## Install

<OnboardingOptionButtons options={["error-monitoring", "performance", "session-replay"]} />

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your application's runtime.

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install @sentry/vue --save
```

```bash {tabTitle:yarn}
yarn add @sentry/vue
```

```bash {tabTitle:pnpm}
pnpm add @sentry/vue
```

## Configure

Configuration should happen as early as possible in your application's lifecycle.

To initialize Sentry in your Vue application, add the following code snippet to your `main.js`:

```javascript {tabTitle:Vue 3} {filename:main.js} {3, 12-41}
import { createApp } from "vue";
import { createRouter } from "vue-router";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/vue";

const app = createApp({
  // ...
});
const router = createRouter({
  // ...
});

Sentry.init({
  app,
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  
  // Adds request headers and IP for users, for more info visit:
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/vue/configuration/options/#sendDefaultPii
  sendDefaultPii: true,
  
  integrations: [
    // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ performance
    Sentry.browserTracingIntegration({ router }),
    // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ performance
    // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ session-replay
    Sentry.replayIntegration(),
    // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ session-replay
  ],
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ performance

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for tracing.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  // Learn more at
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/options/#traces-sample-rate
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,

  // Set `tracePropagationTargets` to control for which URLs trace propagation should be enabled
  tracePropagationTargets: ["localhost", /^https:\/\/yourserver\.io\/api/],
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ performance
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ session-replay

  // Capture Replay for 10% of all sessions,
  // plus for 100% of sessions with an error
  // Learn more at
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/session-replay/configuration/#general-integration-configuration
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ session-replay
});

app.use(router);
app.mount("#app");
```

```javascript {tabTitle:Vue 2} {filename:main.js} {3, 11-35}
import Vue from "vue";
import Router from "vue-router";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/vue";

Vue.use(Router);

const router = new Router({
  // ...
});

Sentry.init({
  Vue,
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ performance
    Sentry.browserTracingIntegration({ router }),
    // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ performance
    // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ session-replay
    Sentry.replayIntegration(),
    // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ session-replay
  ],
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ performance

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for tracing.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  // Learn more at
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/options/#traces-sample-rate
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,

  // Set `tracePropagationTargets` to control for which URLs trace propagation should be enabled
  tracePropagationTargets: ["localhost", /^https:\/\/yourserver\.io\/api/],
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ performance
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ session-replay

  // Capture Replay for 10% of all sessions,
  // plus for 100% of sessions with an error
  // Learn more at

  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ session-replay
});

// ...

new Vue({
  router,
  render: (h) => h(App),
}).$mount("#app");
```

If you're creating more than one Vue 3 app within your application, check out how to initialize the SDK for [multiple apps](./features/multiple-apps).

### Late-Defined Vue Apps

If the Vue application is not defined from the start, you can add error monitoring for Vue-specific errors later on.
To manually add the integration for late-defined Vue applications check out the docs for the <PlatformLink to="/configuration/integrations/vue/">Vue Integration</PlatformLink>.

### Pinia Plugin

Sentry Vue SDK provides a Pinia plugin to capture Pinia action and state data. Learn more about the [Pinia Plugin](./features/pinia) and its options.

## Verify

This snippet includes an intentional error, so you can test that everything is working as soon as you set it up.

Add a button to your page that throws an error:

```javascript {filename:App.vue}
// ...
<button @click="throwError">Throw error</button>
// ...

export default {
  // ...
  methods: {
    throwError() {
      throw new Error('Sentry Error');
    }
  }
};
```

<Alert>

Learn more about manually capturing an error or message in our <PlatformLink to="/usage/">Usage documentation</PlatformLink>.

</Alert>

To view and resolve the recorded error, log into [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and select your project. Clicking on the error's title will open a page where you can see detailed information and mark it as resolved.
