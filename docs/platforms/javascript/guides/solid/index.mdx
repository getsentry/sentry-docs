## Features

In addition to capturing errors, you can monitor interactions between multiple services or applications by [enabling tracing](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/). You can also get to the root of an error or performance issue faster, by watching a video-like reproduction of a user session with [session replay](/product/explore/session-replay/web/getting-started/).

Select which Sentry features you'd like to install in addition to Error Monitoring to get the corresponding installation and configuration instructions below.

## Install

<OnboardingOptionButtons options={["error-monitoring", "performance", "session-replay"]} />

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your applicationâ€™s runtime.

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install @sentry/solid --save
```

```bash {tabTitle:yarn}
yarn add @sentry/solid
```

```bash {tabTitle:pnpm}
pnpm add @sentry/solid
```

## Configure

Configuration should happen as early as possible in your application's lifecycle.

To use the SDK, initialize it in your Solid entry point before bootstrapping your app. In a typical Solid project, that is your `index.jsx` file.

<Alert>
  We currently support Solid 1.8.4 and up.

```javascript {filename: index.jsx} {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "2, 12, 15-21", "session-replay": "13, 25-31"}}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/solid";
import { solidRouterBrowserTracingIntegration } from "@sentry/solid/solidrouter";
import { render } from "solid-js/web";
import { DEV } from "solid-js";
import App from "./app";

// this will only initialize your Sentry client in production builds.
if (!DEV) {
  Sentry.init({
    dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    integrations: [
      solidRouterBrowserTracingIntegration(),
      Sentry.replayIntegration(),
    ],

    // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    // of transactions for tracing.
    // We recommend adjusting this value in production
    // Learn more at
    // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/options/#traces-sample-rate
    tracesSampleRate: 1.0,

    // Set `tracePropagationTargets` to control for which URLs trace propagation should be enabled
    tracePropagationTargets: ["localhost", /^https:\/\/yourserver\.io\/api/],

    // Capture Replay for 10% of all sessions,
    // plus 100% of sessions with an error
    // Learn more at
    // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/session-replay/configuration/#general-integration-configuration
    replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
    replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,
  });
}

const app = document.getElementById("app");

if (!app) throw new Error("No #app element found in the DOM.");

render(() => <App />, app);
```

Once you've done this, the SDK will automatically capture unhandled errors and promise rejections, and monitor performance in the client. You can also [manually capture errors](/platforms/javascript/guides/solid/usage).

## Verify

This snippet includes an intentional error, so you can test that everything is working as soon as you set it up.

```javascript
<button
  type="button"
  onClick={() => {
    throw new Error("Sentry Frontend Error");
  }}
>
  Throw error
</button>
```

This snippet adds a button that throws an error in a Solid component.

Learn more about manually capturing an error or message in our <PlatformLink to="/usage/">Usage documentation</PlatformLink>.

</Alert>

To view and resolve the recorded error, log into [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and select your project. Clicking on the error's title will open a page where you can see detailed information and mark it as resolved.
