The Solid SDK provides a routing instrumentation for Solid Router to create navigation spans to ensure
you collect meaningful performance data about the health of your page loads and associated requests.

The routing instrumentation supports [Solid Router](https://docs.solidjs.com/solid-router) 0.13.0 and up.

To get started, add `Sentry.solidRouterBrowserTracingIntegration` instead of the regular `Sentry.browserTracingIntegration`
and provide the hooks it needs to enable performance tracing:

- `useBeforeLeave` from `@solidjs/router`
- `useLocation` from `@solidjs/router`

Make sure `Sentry.solidRouterBrowserTracingIntegration` is initialized by your `Sentry.init` call, before you wrap
`Router`. Otherwise, the routing instrumentation may not work properly.

Wrap `Router`, `MemoryRouter` or `HashRouter` from `@solidjs/router` using `Sentry.withSentryRouterRouting`. This
creates a higher order component, which will enable Sentry to reach your router context.

```jsx
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/solid";
import { Route, Router, useBeforeLeave, useLocation } from "@solidjs/router";
import { render } from "solid-js/web";
import App from "./app";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "__PUBLIC_DSN__",
  integrations: [Sentry.solidRouterBrowserTracingIntegration({ useBeforeLeave, useLocation })],
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0, //  Capture 100% of the transactions
});

// Wrap Solid Router to collect meaningful performance data on route changes
const SentryRouter = Sentry.withSentryRouterRouting(Router);

render(
  () => (
    <SentryRouter>
      <Route path="/" component={App} />
      ...
    </SentryRouter>
  ),
  document.getElementById("root"),
);
```
