<Note>
  The routing instrumentation supports [Solid Router](https://docs.solidjs.com/solid-router) 0.13.4 and up.
</Note>

The Solid SDK provides a routing instrumentation for Solid Router to create navigation spans to ensure
you collect meaningful performance data about the health of your page loads and associated requests.

To get started, import `solidRouterBrowserTracingIntegration` from `@sentry/solid/solidrouter` and add it to `Sentry.init`
instead of the regular `Sentry.browserTracingIntegration` to enable performance tracing.

Import `withSentryRouterRouting` from `@sentry/solid/solidrouter` and use it to wrap `Router`, `MemoryRouter` or `HashRouter` from `@solidjs/router`.
This creates a higher order component, which will enable Sentry to reach your router context.

<SignInNote />

```jsx
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/solid";
import { solidRouterBrowserTracingIntegration, withSentryRouterRouting } from '@sentry/solid/solidrouter';
import { Route, Router } from "@solidjs/router";
import { render } from "solid-js/web";
import App from "./app";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "__PUBLIC_DSN__",
  integrations: [solidRouterBrowserTracingIntegration()],
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0, //  Capture 100% of the transactions
});

// Wrap Solid Router to collect meaningful performance data on route changes
const SentryRouter = withSentryRouterRouting(Router);

render(
  () => (
    <SentryRouter>
      <Route path="/" component={App} />
      ...
    </SentryRouter>
  ),
  document.getElementById("root"),
);
```
