<Note>
  The routing instrumentation supports [Solid Router](https://docs.solidjs.com/solid-router) 0.13.4 and up.
</Note>

The Sentry SDK provides a routing instrumentation for Solid Router to create navigation spans to ensure
you collect meaningful performance data about the health of your page loads and associated requests.

To get started, import `solidRouterBrowserTracingIntegration` from `@sentry/solidstart/solidrouter` and add it to `Sentry.init`
instead of the regular `Sentry.browserTracingIntegration` to enable performance tracing.

Import `withSentryRouterRouting` from `@sentry/solidstart/solidrouter` and use it to wrap `Router`, `MemoryRouter` or `HashRouter` from `@solidjs/router`.
This creates a higher order component, which will enable Sentry to reach your router context.

```jsx
import { withSentryRouterRouting } from '@sentry/solidstart/solidrouter';
import { Router } from "@solidjs/router";
import { FileRoutes } from "@solidjs/start/router";

// Wrap Solid Router to collect meaningful performance data on route changes
const SentryRouter = withSentryRouterRouting(Router);

export default function App() {
  return (
    <SentryRouter>
      <FileRoutes />
    </SentryRouter>
  )
}
```
