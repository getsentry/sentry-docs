## Understanding Limited Server Tracing

Sentry needs to be initialized before the rest of the application runs.
If the default way of adding an <PlatformLink to="/install/cli-import">`--import` CLI flag</PlatformLink> doesn't work for you,
enable the SDK to add a top-level `import`.

The automatically added top-level `import` will then import the Sentry server-side config at the top of the SolidStart server entry file.
In this case, Sentry isn’t initialized before the app starts, but is set up as early as possible.

<Alert level='warning' title='Restrictions of this installation method'>

This installation method has the fundamental restriction that only native Node.js APIs can be instrumented (such as `fetch` and the `http` module).
As a result, the Sentry SDK will not capture data from database calls, queues, ORMs, third-party libraries, or other framework-specific data.

We recommend using this only if the `--import` flag is not an option for you.

</Alert>

## Initializing Sentry With a Top-level `import`

Enable the top-level `import` by setting `autoInjectServerSentry`:

```typescript {filename:app.config.ts} {8}
import { defineConfig } from "@solidjs/start/config";
import { withSentry } from "@sentry/solidstart";

export default defineConfig(
  withSentry(
    {},
    {
      autoInjectServerSentry: "top-level-import",
    }
  )
);
```

By default, the SDK will add the Sentry server instrumentation file to the build output (typically, `.output/server/instrument.server.mjs`).
The SDK will then automatically import this file at the top of the SolidStart server entry file in the build output.
