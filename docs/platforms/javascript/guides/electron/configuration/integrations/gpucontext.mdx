Adds GPU device context to events.

This integration takes a number of options, which all default to `true`:

```typescript
interface GPUContextOptions {
  /**
   * How much GPU information to request from Electron `app.getGPUInfo` API.
   * `complete` can take much longer to resolve so the default is `basic`.
   * - 'basic': Usually only the `vendor_id` and `id` but some platforms supply more.
   * - 'complete': More detailed information including full names and driver_version.
   *
   * @default 'basic'
   */
  infoLevel: "basic" | "complete";
}
```

To get complete GPU information, set `infoLevel` to `complete`:

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/electron/main";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    Sentry.gpuContextIntegration({
      infoLevel: "complete",
    }),
  ],
});
```
