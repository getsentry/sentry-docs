Adds additional device context to events.

This integration takes a number of options, which all default to `true`:

```typescript
interface AdditionalContextOptions {
  screen: boolean;
}
```

To disable specific context items, set them as `false`:


```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/electron/main";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    Sentry.additionalContextIntegration({
      screen: false,
    }),
  ],
});
```
