Adds additional device context to events.

The constructor takes a number of options which all default to `true`:

```typescript
interface AdditionalContextOptions {
  cpu: boolean;
  screen: boolean;
  memory: boolean;
  language: boolean;
}
```

To disable specific context items, set them as `false`:

<SignInNote />

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/electron";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    Sentry.Integrations.AdditionalContext({
      screen: false,
    }),
  ],
});
```
