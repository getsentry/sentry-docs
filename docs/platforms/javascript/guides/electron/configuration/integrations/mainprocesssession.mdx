This integration captures sessions linked to the lifetime of the Electron main process. Capturing sessions makes it possible to show [release health](/product/releases/health/) statistics in Sentry.

If you'd prefer to capture sessions linked to the focus of `BrowserWindow`,
use the <PlatformLink
to="/configuration/integrations/browserwindowsession">BrowserWindowSession</PlatformLink>
integration in the renderer processes.

{/* TODO(v9): When electron does a new major, update this since autoSessionTracking got removed */}

Unless `autoSessionTracking` is set to `false`, this integration will be automatically added.

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/electron/main";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  autoSessionTracking: false,
});
```

The default behavior is to only send sessions on error or when the main process ends. To send sessions when the main process is created, enable the `sendOnCreate` option.

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/electron/main";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [Sentry.mainProcessSessionIntegration({ sendOnCreate: true })],
});
```
