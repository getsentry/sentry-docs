Event Loop Block errors, or Application Not Responding (ANR) errors are
triggered when the Electron main or renderer processes event loop is blocked for
more than the configured threshold. The Electron SDK reports ANR errors as
Sentry events and can attach a stack trace of the blocking code to the ANR
event.

<Include name="feature-stage-beta.mdx" />

_(Available in version 6.9.0 and above)_

Event loop blocked detection can be individually enabled for the main and
renderer processes.

# Main Process:

## Installation

Install `@sentry/node-native` to use the `eventLoopBlockIntegration` in the main
process.

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install @sentry/node-native
```

```bash {tabTitle:yarn}
yarn add @sentry/node-native
```

```bash {tabTitle:pnpm}
pnpm add @sentry/node-native
```

## Usage

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/electron/main";
import { eventLoopBlockIntegration } from "@sentry/electron/native";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [eventLoopBlockIntegration({ threshold: 500 })],
});
```

## Configuration options

```typescript
export interface ThreadBlockedIntegrationOptions {
  /**
   * Threshold in milliseconds to trigger an event.
   *
   * Defaults to 1000ms.
   */
  threshold: number;
  /**
   * Maximum number of blocked events to send per clock hour.
   *
   * Defaults to 1.
   */
  maxEventsPerHour: number;
  /**
   * Tags to include with blocked events.
   */
  staticTags: { [key: string]: Primitive };
}
```

# Renderer Processes:

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/electron/renderer";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  anrDetection: { captureStackTrace: true },
});
```

## Configuration options

You can pass a configuration object for `anrDetection` in the renderer to
customize the ANR detection behavior.

```Typescript
interface Options {
  /**
   * Interval to send heartbeat messages to the child process.
   *
   * Main process: Defaults to 50ms.
   * Renderer process: Defaults to 1000ms.
   */
  pollInterval: number;
  /**
   * Threshold in milliseconds to trigger an ANR event.
   *
   * Defaults to 5000ms.
   */
  anrThreshold: number;
  /**
   * Whether to capture a stack trace when the ANR event is triggered.
   *
   * Defaults to `false`.
   */
  captureStackTrace: boolean;
}
```

## Event Loop Block Detection Implementation and Overhead

In the main process, the `eventLoopBlockIntegration` uses a native module to
track threads and capture stack traces via v8's native APIs. A worker thread is
used to capture events even if the main thread is blocked. Overhead with no
event loop blocking should be minimal. Each thread notifies the native module
that it is alive every `threshold / 2` milliseconds. Once an event loop block is
detected, v8's native APIs are used to pause all threads and capture stack
traces. The pause time is considered inconsequential if the event loop has
already been blocked for hundreds of milliseconds.

In the renderer processes, a similar polling mechanism is used to detect event
loop blocks. In Electron v34 or newer, the
[`frame.collectJavaScriptCallStack()`](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/web-frame-main#framecollectjavascriptcallstack-experimental)
API is used to capture stack traces when an event loop block is detected. In
older Electron versions, the `v8` inspector API is used to capture stack traces.
The inspector API can have a slight negative impact on performance since it can
cause v8 to de-optimize some code paths. For this reason we recommend updating
to Electron v34 or newer to use this feature in production.
