## Features

In addition to capturing errors, you can monitor interactions between multiple services or applications by [enabling tracing](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/). You can also get to the root of an error or performance issue faster, by watching a video-like reproduction of a user session with [session replay](/product/explore/session-replay/web/getting-started/).

Select which Sentry features you'd like to install in addition to Error Monitoring to get the corresponding installation and configuration instructions below.

## Install

<OnboardingOptionButtons options={["error-monitoring", "performance", "session-replay"]} />

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your applicationâ€™s runtime.

Install the Sentry Capacitor SDK alongside the corresponding Sentry SDK for the framework you're using:

```bash {tabTitle:Angular}
# npm
npm install @sentry/capacitor @sentry/angular --save

# yarn
yarn add @sentry/capacitor @sentry/angular

# pnpm
pnpm add @sentry/capacitor @sentry/angular
```

```bash {tabTitle:React}
# npm
npm install @sentry/capacitor @sentry/react --save

# yarn
yarn add @sentry/capacitor @sentry/react

# pnpm
pnpm add @sentry/capacitor @sentry/react
```

```bash {tabTitle:Vue}
# npm
npm install @sentry/capacitor @sentry/vue --save

# yarn
yarn add @sentry/capacitor @sentry/vue

# pnpm
pnpm add @sentry/capacitor @sentry/vue
```

```bash {tabTitle:Other}
# npm
npm install @sentry/capacitor @sentry/browser --save

# yarn
yarn add @sentry/capacitor @sentry/browser

# pnpm
pnpm add @sentry/capacitor @sentry/browser
```

### Angular Version Compatibility

In its current beta version, the Sentry Capacitor SDK only supports Angular 14 and newer.

If you're using an older version of Angular, you also need to use an older version of the SDK. See the table below for compatibility guidance:

| Angular version | Recommended Sentry SDK                              |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 14 and newer    | `@sentry/capacitor` `@sentry/angular`               |
| 12 or 13        | `@sentry/capacitor^0` `@sentry/angular-ivy@^7` *    |
| 10 or 11        | `@sentry/capacitor^0` `@sentry/angular@^7` *        |

\* These versions of the SDK are no longer maintained or tested. Version 0 might still receive bug fixes, but we don't guarantee support.

### React and Vue Version Compatibility

Both Frameworks are fully compatible with the current and beta versions of Sentry Capacitor.

## Configure

Configuration should happen as early as possible in your application's lifecycle.

Then forward the `init` method from the sibling Sentry SDK for the framework you use, such as Angular in this example:


```typescript {tabTitle: Angular 14+} {filename: app.module.ts}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/capacitor";
import * as SentryAngular from "@sentry/angular";

Sentry.init(
  {
    dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

    sendDefaultPii: true,
  
    // Set your release version, such as "getsentry@1.0.0"
    release: "my-project-name@<release-name>",

```

You can also use the features available with the Sentry SDK for the framework you use, such as [Angular](/platforms/javascript/guides/angular/).

### Source Maps

You will need to upload source maps to make sense of the events you receive in Sentry.

For example, if you are using Capacitor with Ionic-Angular, upload your `www` folder on **every build** you release. The values for `<release_name>` and `<dist>` must match the values passed into `Sentry.init` for events to be deminified correctly.

```bash {tabTitle: Ionic}
sentry-cli sourcemaps upload --release <release_name>  --dist <dist> ./www
```

Learn more about uploading [source maps](/platforms/javascript/guides/capacitor/sourcemaps/).

### Provide Native Debug Information (iOS)

To make stack-trace information for native crashes on iOS easier to understand, you need to provide debug information to Sentry. Debug information is provided by [uploading dSYM files](/platforms/javascript/guides/capacitor/dsym).

## Verify

This snippet includes an intentional error, so you can test that everything is working as soon as you set it up.

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/capacitor";

Sentry.captureException("Test Captured Exception");
```

You can also throw an error anywhere in your application:

```javascript
throw new Error(`Test Thrown Error`);
```

<Alert>

Learn more about manually capturing an error or message in our <PlatformLink to="/usage/">Usage documentation</PlatformLink>.

</Alert>

To view and resolve the recorded error, log into [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and select your project. Clicking on the error's title will open a page where you can see detailed information and mark it as resolved.
