<Alert level="info">
The `spotlightIntegration` is only supported in Sentry Capacitor SDK 3.0.0 and newer.
</Alert>

[Sentry Spotlight](https://spotlightjs.com/) is a local development tool that provides real-time observability for errors, traces, logs, and performance data during development. It allows you to see Sentry events in real-time without sending them to Sentry's servers, making it perfect for local debugging.

To set up Spotlight, follow the [Spotlight setup guide](https://spotlightjs.com/). Once Spotlight is running, you can enable the integration in your Capacitor app.

### Usage

The `spotlightIntegration` sends a copy of all Sentry events to your local Spotlight instance during development. This allows you to debug issues locally with full visibility into errors, transactions, and other telemetry data.

```javascript diff
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/capacitor';

Sentry.init({
+  integrations: [
+    Sentry.spotlightIntegration({
+      sidecarUrl: 'IP:PORT/stream' //Only required when testing outside of a browser.
+    }),
  ]
}, siblingSdk);

```
