## Step 1: Install

Choose the features you want to configure, and this guide will show you how:

<OnboardingOptionButtons
  options={["error-monitoring", "performance", "logs"]}
/>

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-features-expandable" />

### Install the SDK

Use the Bun package manager to add the Sentry SDK to your application:

```bash {tabTitle:Bun}
bun add @sentry/bun
```

## Step 2: Configure

### Initialize the Sentry SDK

Sentry should be initialized as early in your app as possible.
Create a file named `instrument.js` in the root directory of your project and add the following code:

```javascript {filename: instrument.js}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/bun";

// Ensure to call this before importing any other modules!
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // Adds request headers and IP for users, for more info visit:
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/bun/configuration/options/#sendDefaultPii
  sendDefaultPii: true,
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ performance

  // Add Performance Monitoring by setting tracesSampleRate
  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100% of transactions
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  // Learn more at
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/options/#traces-sample-rate
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ performance
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ logs

  // Enable logs to be sent to Sentry
  enableLogs: true,
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ logs
});
```

### Apply Instrumentation to Your App

To make sure that Sentry initializes before any other modules, you need to preload your instrumentation file using the [`--preload`](https://bun.com/docs/runtime#param-preload) flag.
Start your app using:

```bash
bun --preload ./instrument.js app.js
```

## Step 3: Add Readable Stack Traces With Source Maps (Optional)

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-sourcemaps-short-version" />

## Step 4: Verify Your Setup

Let's test your setup and confirm that Sentry is working correctly and sending data to your Sentry project.

### Issues

First, let's verify that Sentry captures errors and creates issues in your Sentry project. Add the following code snippet to your main application file, which will call an undefined function, triggering an error that Sentry will capture:

```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
  try {
    foo();
  } catch (e) {
    Sentry.captureException(e);
  }
}, 99);
```

<OnboardingOption optionId="performance">
### Tracing
To test your tracing configuration, update the previous code snippet by starting a trace to measure the time it takes for the execution of your code:

```javascript
Sentry.startSpan(
  {
    op: "test",
    name: "My First Test Transaction",
  },
  () => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      try {
        foo();
      } catch (e) {
        Sentry.captureException(e);
      }
    }, 99);
  }
);
```

</OnboardingOption>

### View Captured Data in Sentry

Finally, head over to your project on [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io/) to view the collected data (it takes a couple of moments for the data to appear).

## Next Steps

At this point, you should have integrated Sentry into your Bun application, which should already be sending data to your Sentry project.

Now's a good time to customize your setup and look into more advanced topics.
Our next recommended steps for you are:

- Extend Sentry to your frontend using one of our [frontend SDKs](/)
- Learn how to <PlatformLink to="/usage">manually capture errors</PlatformLink>
- Continue to <PlatformLink to="/configuration">customize your configuration</PlatformLink>
- Get familiar with [Sentry's product features](/product) like tracing, insights, and alerts
