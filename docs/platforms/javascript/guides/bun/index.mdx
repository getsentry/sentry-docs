## Install

In addition to capturing errors, you can monitor interactions between multiple services or applications by [enabling tracing](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/).

Select which Sentry features you'd like to install in addition to Error Monitoring to get the corresponding installation and configuration instructions below.

<OnboardingOptionButtons options={["error-monitoring", "performance", "logs"]} />

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your application's runtime.

```bash {tabTitle:Bun}
bun add @sentry/bun
```

## Configure

Configuration should happen as early as possible in your application's lifecycle.

Sentry should be initialized as early in your app as possible. It is essential that you call `Sentry.init` before you require any other modules in your application—otherwise, auto-instrumentation of these modules will _not_ work.

Once this is done, Sentry's Bun SDK captures unhandled exceptions as well as tracing data for your application.

You need to create a file named `instrument.js` that imports and initializes Sentry:

```javascript {filename: instrument.js}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/bun";

// Ensure to call this before importing any other modules!
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // Adds request headers and IP for users, for more info visit:
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/bun/configuration/options/#sendDefaultPii
  sendDefaultPii: true,
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ performance

  // Add Performance Monitoring by setting tracesSampleRate
  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100% of transactions
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  // Learn more at
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/options/#traces-sample-rate
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ performance
});
```

Once you set a `tracesSampleRate`, performance instrumentation is automatically enabled for you. See <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation">Automatic Instrumentation</PlatformLink> to learn about all the things that the SDK automatically instruments for you.

You can also manually capture performance data - see <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation">Custom Instrumentation</PlatformLink> for details.

## Use

<Alert level='warning'>

Import `instrument.js` before any other modules to ensure Sentry initializes early. If you initialize later, auto-instrumentation and modules like database monitoring, agent monitoring, tracing may not work.

</Alert>

```javascript {filename: app.js}
// Import this first!
import "./instrument";

// Now import other modules
import http from "http";

// Your application code goes here
```

## Verify

This snippet includes an intentional error, so you can test that everything is working as soon as you set it up.

```javascript
// ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ performance
Sentry.startSpan({
  op: "test",
  name: "My First Test Transaction",
// ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ performance
}, () => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    try {
      foo();
    } catch (e) {
      Sentry.captureException(e);
    }
  }, 99);
// ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ performance
});
// ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ performance
```

To view and resolve the recorded error, log into [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and select your project. Clicking on the error's title will open a page where you can see detailed information and mark it as resolved.
