<Alert>

  Sentry's Ember addon enables automatic reporting of errors, exceptions, and transactions.

</Alert>

The minimum supported Ember.js version is `4.0.0`.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-prerequisites" />

## Features

In addition to capturing errors, you can monitor interactions between multiple services or applications by [enabling tracing](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/). You can also get to the root of an error or performance issue faster, by watching a video-like reproduction of a user session with [session replay](/product/explore/session-replay/web/getting-started/).

Select which Sentry features you'd like to install in addition to Error Monitoring to get the corresponding installation and configuration instructions below.

## Install

<OnboardingOptionButtons options={["error-monitoring", "performance", "session-replay", "user-feedback"]} />

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your application's runtime.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-install" />

## Configure

Configuration should happen as early as possible in your application's lifecycle.

This snippet includes automatic instrumentation to monitor the performance of your application, which registers and configures the Tracing integration, including custom [Ember instrumentation](./configuration/ember-options/).

```javascript
import Application from "@ember/application";
import Resolver from "ember-resolver";
import loadInitializers from "ember-load-initializers";
import config from "./config/environment";

import * as Sentry from "@sentry/ember";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  
  // Adds request headers and IP for users, for more info visit:
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/ember/configuration/options/#sendDefaultPii
  sendDefaultPii: true,
  
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ session-replay
  integrations: [
    Sentry.replayIntegration(),
    // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ user-feedback
    Sentry.feedbackIntegration({
      // Additional SDK configuration goes in here, for example:
      colorScheme: "system",
    }),
    // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ user-feedback
  ],
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ session-replay
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ performance

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for tracing.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  // Learn more at
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/options/#traces-sample-rate
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ performance
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ session-replay

  // Capture Replay for 10% of all sessions,
  // plus for 100% of sessions with an error
  // Learn more at
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/session-replay/configuration/#general-integration-configuration
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ session-replay
});

export default class App extends Application {
  modulePrefix = config.modulePrefix;
  podModulePrefix = config.podModulePrefix;
  Resolver = Resolver;
}
```

<Alert>

  This SDK uses Ember configuration conventions to manage its automatic instrumentation and other Sentry options. This additional configuration can be found under <PlatformLink to="/configuration/ember-options/">Ember options</PlatformLink>.

## Verify

This snippet includes an intentional error, so you can test that everything is working as soon as you set it up.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-verify" />

<Alert>

Learn more about manually capturing an error or message in our <PlatformLink to="/usage/">Usage documentation</PlatformLink>.

</Alert>

To view and resolve the recorded error, log into [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and select your project. Clicking on the error's title will open a page where you can see detailed information and mark it as resolved.
