## Step 1: Install

Choose the features you want to configure, and this guide will show you how:

<OnboardingOptionButtons
  options={[
    "error-monitoring",
    "performance",
    "session-replay",
    "user-feedback",
    "logs",
  ]}
/>

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-features-expandable" />

### Install the Sentry SDK

Run the command for your preferred package manager to add the Sentry SDK to your application:

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-install" />

## Step 2: Configure

### Initialize the SDK

Configuration should happen as early as possible in your application's lifecycle. Add the following to your `app/app.js` file:

```javascript {filename:app.js}
import Application from "@ember/application";
import Resolver from "ember-resolver";
import loadInitializers from "ember-load-initializers";
import config from "./config/environment";

import * as Sentry from "@sentry/ember";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // Adds request headers and IP for users, for more info visit:
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/ember/configuration/options/#sendDefaultPii
  sendDefaultPii: true,

  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ session-replay
  integrations: [
    Sentry.replayIntegration(),
    // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ user-feedback
    Sentry.feedbackIntegration({
      // Additional SDK configuration goes in here, for example:
      colorScheme: "system",
    }),
    // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ user-feedback
  ],
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ session-replay
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ logs

  // Enable logs to be sent to Sentry
  enableLogs: true,
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ logs

  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ performance
  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for tracing.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  // Learn more at
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/options/#traces-sample-rate
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ performance
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ session-replay

  // Capture Replay for 10% of all sessions,
  // plus for 100% of sessions with an error
  // Learn more at
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/session-replay/configuration/#general-integration-configuration
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,
  // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ session-replay
});

export default class App extends Application {
  modulePrefix = config.modulePrefix;
  podModulePrefix = config.podModulePrefix;
  Resolver = Resolver;
}
```

## Step 3: Add Readable Stack Traces With Source Maps (Optional)

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-sourcemaps-short-version" />

## Step 4: Avoid Ad Blockers With Tunneling (Optional)

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-tunneling" />

## Step 5: Verify Your Setup

Let's test your setup and confirm that Sentry is working correctly and sending data to your Sentry project.

### Issues

To verify that Sentry captures errors and creates issues in your Sentry project, add the following test button to one of your templates, which will trigger an error that Sentry will capture when you click it:

```handlebars {filename: application.hbs}
{{! rest of your page }}
<button type="button" {{on "click" this.throwTestError}}>
  Test Sentry Error
</button>
```

Next, add the corresponding action to your controller or component:

```javascript {filename: application.js}
import Controller from "@ember/controller";
import { action } from "@ember/object";

export default class ApplicationController extends Controller {
  @action
  throwTestError() {
    throw new Error("Sentry Test Error");
  }
}
```

<OnboardingOption optionId="performance" hideForThisOption>
  Open the page in a browser and click the button to trigger a frontend error.
</OnboardingOption>

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-browser-sandbox-warning" />

<OnboardingOption optionId="performance">
### Tracing
To test your tracing configuration, update the previous code snippet to start a trace to measure the time it takes to execute your code:

```javascript {filename: application.js} {3,8-12}
import Controller from "@ember/controller";
import { action } from "@ember/object";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/ember";

export default class ApplicationController extends Controller {
  @action
  throwTestError() {
    Sentry.startSpan({ op: "test", name: "Example Span" }, () => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        throw new Error("Sentry Test Error");
      }, 99);
    });
  }
}
```

Open the page in a browser and click the button to trigger a frontend error and a trace.

</OnboardingOption>

### View Captured Data in Sentry

Now, head over to your project on [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io) to view the collected data (it takes a couple of moments for the data to appear).

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-verify-locate-data" />

## Next Steps

At this point, you should have integrated Sentry into your Ember application and should already be sending data to your Sentry project.

Now's a good time to customize your setup and look into more advanced topics.
Our next recommended steps for you are:

- Learn how to [manually capture errors](/platforms/javascript/guides/ember/usage/)
- Continue to [customize your configuration](/platforms/javascript/guides/ember/configuration/)
- Get familiar with [Sentry's product features](/product/) like tracing, insights, and alerts
