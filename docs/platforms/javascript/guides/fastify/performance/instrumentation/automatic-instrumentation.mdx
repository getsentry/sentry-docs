title: Automatic Instrumentation
description: "Learn what transactions are captured after tracing is enabled."
---

When performance is enable through `tracesSampleRate`, `enableTracing` or a `tracesSampler` function, the Sentry SDK will automatically capture spans for the following:

- Fastify routes & middlewares
- HTTP requests made with `http`, `https` and `fetch`
- DB queries made with:
  - `mysql`
  - `mysql2`
  - `pg`
  - `graphql` (including Apollo Server)
  - `mongo`
  - `mongoose`
  - `prisma`

All of these are automatically set up for you without any further configuration. The only exception is Prisma, which you have to opt-in for:

```javascript
const Sentry = require("@sentry/node");

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  integrations: [Sentry.prismaIntegration()],
});
```
