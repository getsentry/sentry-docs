When integrating Sentry with a Fastify application, you can leverage provided middlewares to automatically instrument and monitor the performance of your application.

<Note>

If you’re adopting Performance in a high-throughput environment, we recommend testing prior to deployment to ensure that your service’s performance characteristics maintain expectations.

```javascript
const Sentry = require("@sentry/node");

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // We recommend adjusting this value in production, or using tracesSampler
  // for finer control
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

const { fastify } = require("fastify");
const app = fastify();

Sentry.setupFastifyErrorHandler(app);

// the rest of your app

app.listen({ port: 3030 });
```

You can also manually create spans in your app:

```javascript
const Sentry = require("@sentry/node");

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

// make sure to only require `http` after Sentry has been initialized!
const { fastify } = require("fastify");
const http = require("http");

const app = fastify();
Sentry.setupFastifyErrorHandler(app);

app.get("/my-route", function (req, res) {
  try {
    // this should generate an http span
    request = http.get("http://sentry.io", (res) => {
      console.log(`STATUS: ${res.statusCode}`);
      console.log(`HEADERS: ${JSON.stringify(res.headers)}`);
    });

    // this error event should have trace context
    foo();
  } catch (err) {
    Sentry.captureException(err);
  }
});

app.listen({ port: 3030 });
```

## Automatic Instrumentation

See <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation">Automatic Instrumentation</PlatformLink> to learn about all the things that the SDK automatically instruments for you.

## Custom Instrumentation

You can also manually start spans to instrument specific parts of your code. This is useful when you want to measure the performance of a specific operation or function.

See <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation">Custom Instrumentation</PlatformLink> on how to manually start spans.
