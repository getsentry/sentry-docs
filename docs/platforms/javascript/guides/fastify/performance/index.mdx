As soon as you define a `tracesSampleRate` for your Sentry SDK, Performance Monitoring will be enabled. This will automatically instrument and monitor the performance of your application.

<Note>

If you’re adopting Performance in a high-throughput environment, we recommend testing prior to deployment to ensure that your service’s performance characteristics maintain expectations.

## Automatic Instrumentation

See <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation">Automatic Instrumentation</PlatformLink> to learn about all the things that the SDK automatically instruments for you.

## Custom Instrumentation

You can also manually start spans to instrument specific parts of your code. This is useful when you want to measure the performance of a specific operation or function.

See <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation">Custom Instrumentation</PlatformLink> on how to manually start spans.
