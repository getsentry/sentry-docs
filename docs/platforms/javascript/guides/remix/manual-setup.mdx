If you can't (or prefer not to) run the [automatic setup](/platforms/javascript/guides/remix/#install), you can follow the instructions below to configure your application.

## Installation

Get started by installing the Sentry Remix SDK:

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install --save @sentry/remix
```

```bash {tabTitle:Yarn}
yarn add @sentry/remix
```

```bash {tabTitle:pnpm}
pnpm add @sentry/remix
```

## Configuration

To use this SDK, initialize Sentry in your Remix entry points for both the client and server.

Create two files in the root directory of your project, `entry.client.tsx` and `entry.server.tsx` (if they don't already exist). Add your initialization code in these files for the client-side and server-side SDK, respectively.

The two configuration types are mostly the same, except that some configuration features, like Session Replay, only work in `entry.client.tsx`.

<SignInNote />

### Client-side Configuration

```typescript {tabTitle:Client} {filename: entry.client.tsx}
import { useLocation, useMatches } from "@remix-run/react";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/remix";
import { useEffect } from "react";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    Sentry.browserTracingIntegration({
      useEffect,
      useLocation,
      useMatches,
    }),
    // Replay is only available in the client
    Sentry.replayIntegration(),
  ],

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for performance monitoring.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,

  // Set `tracePropagationTargets` to control for which URLs distributed tracing should be enabled
  tracePropagationTargets: ["localhost", /^https:\/\/yourserver\.io\/api/],

  // Capture Replay for 10% of all sessions,
  // plus for 100% of sessions with an error
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

### Server-side Configuration

```typescript {tabTitle:Server} {filename: entry.server.tsx}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/remix";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for performance monitoring.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

Initialize Sentry in your entry point for the server to capture exceptions and get performance metrics for your [`action`](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/route/action) and [`loader`](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/route/loader) functions. You can also initialize Sentry's database integrations, such as <Link to="/platforms/javascript/guides/node/performance/database/opt-in/#prisma-orm-integration">Prisma</Link>, to get spans for your database calls.

To catch React component errors (in Remix v1) and routing transactions (in all Remix versions), wrap your Remix root with `withSentry`.

<Note>

If you use the Remix `v2_errorBoundary` future flag, you must also configure a [v2 ErrorBoundary](#v2-errorboundary).

</Note>

```typescript {filename: root.tsx}
import {
  Links,
  LiveReload,
  Meta,
  Outlet,
  Scripts,
  ScrollRestoration,
} from "@remix-run/react";

import { withSentry } from "@sentry/remix";

function App() {
  return (
    <html>
      <head>
        <Meta />
        <Links />
      </head>
      <body>
        <Outlet />
        <ScrollRestoration />
        <Scripts />
        <LiveReload />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}

export default withSentry(App);
```

<Note>

If you use Remix v2, `wrapWithErrorBoundary` is disabled by default. You still need to wrap your root component with `withSentry` to capture routing transactions.

</Note>

You can disable or configure `ErrorBoundary` using a second parameter to `withSentry`.

```typescript
withSentry(App, {
  wrapWithErrorBoundary: false,
});

// or

withSentry(App, {
  errorBoundaryOptions: {
    fallback: <p>An error has occurred</p>,
  },
});
```

## Remix v2 Features

_Available from SDK version 7.59.0_

[Remix v2](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/pages/v2) will introduce new features that require additional configuration to work with Sentry. These features are also available from version [1.17.0](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/releases/tag/remix%401.17.0) with [future flags](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/pages/api-development-strategy#current-future-flags).

### v2 ErrorBoundary

To capture errors from [v2 ErrorBoundary](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/route/error-boundary-v2), you should define your own `ErrorBoundary` in `root.tsx` and use `Sentry.captureRemixErrorBoundaryError` inside of it. You can also create route-specific error capturing behavior by defining `ErrorBoundary` in your route components. The `ErrorBoundary` you define in `root.tsx` will be used as a fallback for all routes.

```typescript {filename: root.tsx}
import { captureRemixErrorBoundaryError } from "@sentry/remix";

export const ErrorBoundary: V2_ErrorBoundaryComponent = () => {
  const error = useRouteError();

  captureRemixErrorBoundaryError(error);

  return <div> ... </div>;
};
```

## v2 Server-side Errors

Sentry won't be able to capture your unexpected server-side errors automatically on Remix v2. To work around this, instrument the [`handleError`](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/file-conventions/entry.server#handleerror) function in your server entry point.

If you're using Sentry Remix SDK version `7.87.0` or higher, you can use `wrapRemixHandleError` to export as your `handleError` function.

```typescript {filename: entry.server.tsx (@sentry/remix >= 7.87.0)}
import { wrapRemixHandleError } from "@sentry/remix";

export const handleError = wrapRemixHandleError;
```

For SDK versions older than `7.87.0`, you can use `Sentry.captureRemixServerException` to capture errors inside `handleError`.

```typescript {filename: entry.server.tsx (@sentry/remix < 7.87.0)}
export function handleError(
  error: unknown,
  { request }: DataFunctionArgs
): void {
  if (error instanceof Error) {
    Sentry.captureRemixServerException(error, "remix.server", request);
  } else {
    // Optionally capture non-Error objects
    Sentry.captureException(error);
  }
}
```

After you've completed this setup, the SDK will automatically capture unhandled errors and promise rejections, and monitor performance in the client. You can also [manually capture errors](/platforms/javascript/guides/remix/usage).

<Note>

You can refer to [Remix Docs](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/guides/envvars#browser-environment-variables) to learn how to use your Sentry DSN with environment variables.

</Note>

## Configure Source Maps Upload

To enable readable stack traces, <PlatformLink to="/sourcemaps">configure source maps upload</PlatformLink> for your production builds.

## Custom Express Server

If you use a custom Express server in your Remix application, you should wrap your [`createRequestHandler` function](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/other-api/adapter#createrequesthandler) manually with `wrapExpressCreateRequestHandler`. This isn't necessary if you're using the built-in Remix App Server.

<Note>

`wrapExpressCreateRequestHandler` is available starting with version 7.11.0.

</Note>

```typescript {filename: server/index.ts}
import { wrapExpressCreateRequestHandler } from "@sentry/remix";
import { createRequestHandler } from "@remix-run/express";

// ...

const createSentryRequestHandler =
  wrapExpressCreateRequestHandler(createRequestHandler);

app.all("*", createSentryRequestHandler(/* ... */));
```

### Usage with Vite development mode (only for SDK versions < 7.106.0)

<Alert level='info'>

@sentry/remix version 7.106.0 introduced support for Vite development mode, so you don't need to await the build loader. It's recommended to upgrade to the latest version of @sentry/remix.

</Alert>

For SDK versions < 7.106.0, the function returned by `wrapExpressCreateRequestHandler` accepts the build object as its first parameter. So if your boilerplate code passes the argument as a function, you need to update the usage. For example, if you're using [Vite](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/future/vite), you'll need to wait for the build loader before passing it to the wrapped handler.

```diff {filename: server/index.ts}
    wrapExpressCreateRequestHandler(createRequestHandler)({
      build: viteDevServer
-       ? () =>
-         viteDevServer.ssrLoadModule(
-           "virtual:remix/server-build"
-         )
+       ? await viteDevServer.ssrLoadModule(
+           "virtual:remix/server-build"
+         )
      : await import(BUILD_DIR + "/index.js"),
      ...
    })
```
