If you can't (or prefer not to) run the [automatic setup](/platforms/javascript/guides/remix/#install), you can follow the instructions below to configure your application.

## Features

In addition to capturing errors, you can monitor interactions between multiple services or applications by [enabling tracing](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/). You can also analyze performance profiles from real users with [profiling](/product/explore/profiling/). Lastly, adding [session replay](/product/explore/session-replay/web/getting-started/) lets you get to the root of an error or performance issue faster by watching a video-like reproduction of a user session.

Select which Sentry features you'd like to install in addition to Error Monitoring to get the corresponding installation and configuration instructions below.

## Install

<OnboardingOptionButtons
  options={["error-monitoring", "performance", "profiling", "session-replay"]}
/>

Get started by installing the Sentry Remix SDK:

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install @sentry/remix --save
```

```bash {tabTitle:yarn}
yarn add @sentry/remix
```

```bash {tabTitle:pnpm}
pnpm add @sentry/remix
```

## Configure

To use this SDK, initialize Sentry in your Remix project for both the client and server.

### Client-side Configuration

```typescript {tabTitle:Client} {filename: entry.client.tsx} {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "8-12,16-23", "session-replay": "13-14,24-28"}}
import { useLocation, useMatches } from "@remix-run/react";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/remix";
import { useEffect } from "react";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    Sentry.browserTracingIntegration({
      useEffect,
      useLocation,
      useMatches,
    }),
    // Replay is only available in the client
    Sentry.replayIntegration(),
  ],

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for tracing.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  // Learn more at
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/options/#traces-sample-rate
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,

  // Set `tracePropagationTargets` to control for which URLs distributed tracing should be enabled
  tracePropagationTargets: ["localhost", /^https:\/\/yourserver\.io\/api/],

  // Capture Replay for 10% of all sessions,
  // plus for 100% of sessions with an error
  // Learn more at
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/session-replay/configuration/#general-integration-configuration
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

#### Remix ErrorBoundary

To capture errors from [ErrorBoundary](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/route/error-boundary), you should define your own `ErrorBoundary` in `root.tsx` and use `Sentry.captureRemixErrorBoundaryError` inside of it. You can also create route-specific error capturing behavior by defining `ErrorBoundary` in your route components. The `ErrorBoundary` you define in `root.tsx` will be used as a fallback for all routes.

```typescript {filename: root.tsx}
import { captureRemixErrorBoundaryError } from "@sentry/remix";

export const ErrorBoundary: V2_ErrorBoundaryComponent = () => {
  const error = useRouteError();

  captureRemixErrorBoundaryError(error);

  return <div> ... </div>;
};
```

To catch React component errors (in Remix v1) and routing transactions (in all Remix versions), wrap your Remix root with `withSentry`.

<Alert>

If you use Remix v1 with the `v2_errorBoundary` future flag, you must also configure your `ErrorBoundary`.

</Alert>

```typescript {filename: root.tsx}
import {
  Links,
  LiveReload,
  Meta,
  Outlet,
  Scripts,
  ScrollRestoration,
} from "@remix-run/react";

import { withSentry } from "@sentry/remix";

function App() {
  return (
    <html>
      <head>
        <Meta />
        <Links />
      </head>
      <body>
        <Outlet />
        <ScrollRestoration />
        <Scripts />
        <LiveReload />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}

export default withSentry(App);
```

<Alert>

If you use Remix v2, `wrapWithErrorBoundary` is disabled by default. You still need to wrap your root component with `withSentry` to capture routing transactions.

</Alert>

You can disable or configure `ErrorBoundary` using a second parameter to `withSentry`.

```typescript
withSentry(App, {
  wrapWithErrorBoundary: false,
});

// or

withSentry(App, {
  errorBoundaryOptions: {
    fallback: <p>An error has occurred</p>,
  },
});
```

### Server-side Configuration

Create an instrumentation file (named here as `instrument.server.mjs`) in your project. Add your initialization code in this file for the server-side SDK.

```typescript {tabTitle:Server} {filename: instrument.server.mjs} {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "5-9"}}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/remix";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for tracing.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  // Learn more at
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/options/#traces-sample-rate
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,

  // To use Sentry OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation
  // default: false
  autoInstrumentRemix: true,

  // Optionally capture action formData attributes with errors.
  // This requires `sendDefaultPii` set to true as well.
  captureActionFormDataKeys: {
    key_x: true,
    key_y: true,
  },
  // To capture action formData attributes.
  sendDefaultPii: true,
});
```

Then run your Remix server with:

```bash
NODE_OPTIONS='--import=./instrument.server.mjs' remix-serve build
# or
NODE_OPTIONS='--require=./instrument.server.cjs' remix-serve build
```

If you use the Express server instead of the Remix built-in server, you can alternatively import your instrumentation file directly at the top of your server implementation. See the example [here](#custom-express-server).

Sentry's Remix SDK will automatically record your [`action`](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/route/action) and [`loader`](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/route/loader) transactions, as well as server-side errors. You can also initialize Sentry's database integrations, such as <Link to="/platforms/javascript/guides/node/configuration/integrations/prisma/">Prisma</Link>, to get spans for your database calls.

#### Server-Side Errors

To capture server-side errors automatically, instrument the [`handleError`](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/file-conventions/entry.server#handleerror) function in your server entry point.

If you're using Sentry Remix SDK version `7.87.0` or higher, you can wrap your error handler with `wrapHandleErrorWithSentry` or use `sentryHandleError` to export as your `handleError` function.

```typescript {filename: entry.server.tsx (@sentry/remix >= 7.87.0)}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/remix";

export const handleError = Sentry.wrapHandleErrorWithSentry(
  (error, { request }) => {
    // Custom handleError implementation
  }
);

// Alternative: Use the Sentry utility function if you don't need to wrap a custom function
export const handleError = Sentry.sentryHandleError;
```

For SDK versions older than `7.87.0`, you can use `Sentry.captureRemixServerException` to capture errors inside `handleError`.

```typescript {filename: entry.server.tsx (@sentry/remix < 7.87.0)}
export function handleError(
  error: unknown,
  { request }: DataFunctionArgs
): void {
  if (error instanceof Error) {
    Sentry.captureRemixServerException(error, "remix.server", request);
  } else {
    // Optionally capture non-Error objects
    Sentry.captureException(error);
  }
}
```

### Source Maps Upload

To enable readable stack traces, <PlatformLink to="/sourcemaps">configure source maps upload</PlatformLink> for your production builds.

After you've completed this setup, the SDK will automatically capture unhandled errors and promise rejections, and monitor performance. You can also [manually capture errors](/platforms/javascript/guides/remix/usage).

## Verify

This snippet includes an intentional error, so you can test that everything is working as soon as you set it up.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-verify" />

<Alert>

You can refer to [Remix Docs](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/guides/envvars#browser-environment-variables) to learn how to use your Sentry DSN with environment variables.

</Alert>

## Custom Express Server

You can import your server instrumentation file at the top of your Express server implementation.

```typescript {filename: server.ts}
// import the Sentry instrumentation file before anything else.
import "./instrument.server.mjs";
// alternatively `require('./instrument.server.cjs')`

// ...

const app = express();

// ...
```
