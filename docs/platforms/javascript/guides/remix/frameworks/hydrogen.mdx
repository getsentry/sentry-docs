If you're using the Shopify Hydrogen framework, you can use the Sentry Remix SDK to add Sentry instrumentation to your app.

First, install the Sentry Remix SDK in your application. We recommend using the Sentry wizard to automatically install the SDK:

```bash
npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i remix
```

If the wizard doesn't work for you, you can also [set up the Remix SDK manually](/platforms/javascript/guides/remix/manual-setup/).

After installing the Sentry Remix SDK, delete the newly generated `instrumentation.server.mjs` file and all newly generated code from `entry.server.tsx`. This instrumentation is not needed because you are going to use the Sentry Cloudflare SDK for server-side instrumentation.

Now you can install the Sentry Cloudflare SDK. First, install the SDK with your package manager:

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-install" />

Then update your `server.ts` file to use the `wrapRequestHandler` method:

```ts {filename:server.ts}
import { wrapRequestHandler } from "@sentry/cloudflare";

/**
 * Export a fetch handler in module format.
 */
export default {
  async fetch(
    request: Request,
    env: Env,
    executionContext: ExecutionContext
  ): Promise<Response> {
    return wrapRequestHandler(
      {
        options: {
          dsn: "YOUR_DSN_HERE",
          tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
        },
        // Need to cast to any because this is not on cloudflare
        request: request as any,
        context: executionContext,
      },
      async () => {
        // request handling logic
      }
    );
  },
};
```

To remove errors relating to `node:async_hooks` (which is included in the sdk, but not used by `wrapRequestHandler`), add a custom vite plugin to your `vite.config.ts` file that will alias it to an empty module:

```ts {filename:vite.config.ts}
export function removeAsyncHooksPlugin(): Plugin {
  return {
    name: "remove-async-hooks",
    load: (id) => {
      if (id === "node:async_hooks") {
        return "export default {}";
      }
    },
  };
}

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    removeAsyncHooksPlugin(),
    // rest of your plugins
  ],
});
```
