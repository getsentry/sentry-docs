If you're using the Shopify Hydrogen framework, you can use the Sentry Remix SDK to add Sentry instrumentation to your app.

## 1. Installing Sentry Remix SDK

First, install the Sentry Remix SDK in your application. We recommend using the Sentry wizard to automatically install the SDK:

```bash
npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i remix
```

If the wizard doesn't work for you, you can also [set up the Remix SDK manually](/platforms/javascript/guides/remix/manual-setup/).

## 2. Installing Sentry Cloudflare SDK

After installing the Sentry Remix SDK, delete the newly generated `instrumentation.server.mjs` file and all newly generated code from `entry.server.tsx`. This instrumentation is not needed because you are going to use the Sentry Cloudflare SDK for server-side instrumentation.

Now you can install the Sentry Cloudflare SDK. First, install the SDK with your package manager:

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install @sentry/cloudflare --save
```

```bash {tabTitle:yarn}
yarn add @sentry/cloudflare
```

```bash {tabTitle:pnpm}
pnpm add @sentry/cloudflare
```


Then update your `server.ts` file to use the `wrapRequestHandler` method:

```ts {filename:server.ts}
import { wrapRequestHandler } from "@sentry/cloudflare";

/**
 * Export a fetch handler in module format.
 */
export default {
  async fetch(
    request: Request,
    env: Env,
    executionContext: ExecutionContext
  ): Promise<Response> {
    return wrapRequestHandler(
      {
        options: {
          dsn: "YOUR_DSN_HERE",
          tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
        },
        // Need to cast to any because this is not on cloudflare
        request: request as any,
        context: executionContext,
      },
      async () => {
        // request handling logic
      }
    );
  },
};
```

To remove errors relating to `node:async_hooks` (which is included in the sdk, but not used by `wrapRequestHandler`), add a custom vite plugin to your `vite.config.ts` file that will alias it to an empty module:

```ts {filename:vite.config.ts}
export function removeAsyncHooksPlugin(): Plugin {
  return {
    name: "remove-async-hooks",
    load: (id) => {
      if (id === "node:async_hooks") {
        return "export default {}";
      }
    },
  };
}

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    removeAsyncHooksPlugin(),
    // rest of your plugins
  ],
});
```
