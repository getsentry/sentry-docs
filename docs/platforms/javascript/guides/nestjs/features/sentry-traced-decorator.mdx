<Note>
  The `@SentryTraced` decorator is available from version `@sentry/nestjs` 8.15.0 and up.
</Note>

The NestJS SDK now includes a @SentryTraced decorator that allows you to collect spans for any function it decorates.
This feature enables more granular performance monitoring and helps you gather detailed insights into the performance
of individual functions within your application.

To get started import `@SentryTraced` from `@sentry/nestjs` and use it to decorate a function of your choice.

```jsx
import { SentryTraced } from '@sentry/nestjs';

export class MyService {
  @SentryTraced()
  myFunction() {
    // Your function logic here
  }
}
```
