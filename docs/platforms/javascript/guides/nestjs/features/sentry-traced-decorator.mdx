<Alert>
  The `@SentryTraced` decorator is available from version `@sentry/nestjs` 8.15.0 and up.
</Alert>

The NestJS SDK includes a `@SentryTraced` decorator that will create spans whenever the method it decorates is invoked.
This feature enables more granular performance monitoring and helps you gather detailed insights into the performance
of individual functions within your application.

To get started import `SentryTraced` from `@sentry/nestjs` and use it to decorate a function of your choice:

```typescript
import { SentryTraced } from '@sentry/nestjs';

export class MyService {
  @SentryTraced()
  myFunction() {
    // Your function logic here
  }
}
```
