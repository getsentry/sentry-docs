This guide explains how to setup Sentry in your Nest.js application.

Don't already have an account and Sentry project established? Head over to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/signup/), then return to this page.

<Note>
This guide is for version 8.0.0 and up of `@sentry/node`.
</Note>

## Install

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your applicationâ€™s runtime. This means that you have to add `@sentry/node` as a runtime dependency to your application:

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install --save @sentry/node
```

```bash {tabTitle:Yarn}
yarn add @sentry/node
```

## Configure

Sentry should be initialized as early as possible in the `bootstrap()` function in `main.ts`. After initialization, add the `Sentry.setupNestErrorHandler`.

Once this is done, Sentry's Node SDK captures unhandled exceptions as well as tracing data for your application.

## Performance

If you set a `tracesSampleRate`, performance instrumentation will automatically be enabled for you. See <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation">Automatic Instrumentation</PlatformLink> to learn about all the things that the SDK automatically instruments for you.

You can also manually capture performance data - see <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation">Custom Instrumentation</PlatformLink> for details.

## Verify

This snippet includes an intentional error, so you can test that everything is working as soon as you set it up.
