## Step 1: Install

Choose the features you want to configure, and this guide will show you how:

<OnboardingOptionButtons
  options={["error-monitoring", "performance", "profiling"]}
/>

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-features-expandable" />

### Install the Sentry SDK

Run the command for your preferred package manager to add the Sentry SDK to your application:

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-install" />

## Step 2: Configure

### Initialize the Sentry SDK

To import and initialize Sentry, create a file named `instrument.ts` in the root directory of your project and add the following code:

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-config" />

### Apply Instrumentation to Your App

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-use" />

## Step 3: Capture Nest.js Errors

By default, Sentry only captures unhandled exceptions that aren't caught by an error filter.
Additionally, `HttpException`s (including [derivatives](https://docs.nestjs.com/exception-filters#built-in-http-exceptions)) aren't captured by default because they mostly act as control flow vehicles.

To make sure Sentry captures all your app's errors, configure error handling based on how your application manages exceptions:

### Using a Global Catch-All Exception Filter

If you have a global catch-all exception filter, add a `@SentryExceptionCaptured()` decorator to the filter's `catch()` method:

```typescript {2, 6}
import { Catch, ExceptionFilter } from "@nestjs/common";
import { SentryExceptionCaptured } from "@sentry/nestjs";

@Catch()
export class YourCatchAllExceptionFilter implements ExceptionFilter {
  @SentryExceptionCaptured()
  catch(exception, host): void {
    // your implementation here
  }
}
```

### Not Using a Global Catch-All Exception Filter

If you don't have a global catch-all exception filter, add the `SentryGlobalFilter` to the providers of your main module, **before** any other exception filters:

```typescript {2-3, 7-10}
import { Module } from "@nestjs/common";
import { APP_FILTER } from "@nestjs/core";
import { SentryGlobalFilter } from "@sentry/nestjs/setup";

@Module({
  providers: [
    {
      provide: APP_FILTER,
      useClass: SentryGlobalFilter,
    },
    // ..other providers
  ],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

### Using Error Filters for Specific Exception Types

If you have error filters for specific types of exceptions (for example, `@Catch(HttpException)`) and you want to report these errors to Sentry, you need to capture them in the `catch()` handler using `Sentry.captureException()`:

```typescript {4,9}
import { ArgumentsHost, BadRequestException, Catch } from "@nestjs/common";
import { BaseExceptionFilter } from "@nestjs/core";
import { ExampleException } from "./example.exception";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nestjs";

@Catch(ExampleException)
export class ExampleExceptionFilter extends BaseExceptionFilter {
  catch(exception: unknown, host: ArgumentsHost) {
    Sentry.captureException(exception);
    return super.catch(new BadRequestException(exception.message), host);
  }
}
```

<Expandable title="Are you using Microservices?">
If you're using `@nestjs/microservices` make sure to handle errors in RPC contexts correctly by providing your own `RpcExceptionFilter` (see [Nest.js Microservices documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/exception-filters)).
`SentryGlobalFilter` in a [hybrid application](https://docs.nestjs.com/faq/hybrid-application) doesn't extend `BaseRpcExceptionFilter` since this depends on `@nestjs/microservices`.

Use `Sentry.captureException(exception)` in your custom filter in case you want to send these errors to Sentry:

```typescript
import { Catch, RpcExceptionFilter, ArgumentsHost } from "@nestjs/common";
import { Observable, throwError } from "rxjs";
import { RpcException } from "@nestjs/microservices";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nestjs";

@Catch(RpcException)
export class ExceptionFilter implements RpcExceptionFilter<RpcException> {
  catch(exception: RpcException, host: ArgumentsHost): Observable<any> {
    Sentry.captureException(exception); // optional
    return throwError(() => exception.getError());
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Add Readable Stack Traces With Source Maps (Optional)

The stack traces in your Sentry errors probably won't look like your actual code. To fix this, upload your source maps to Sentry.
The easiest way to do this is by using the Sentry Wizard:

```bash
npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i sourcemaps
```

## Step 5: Verify Your Setup

Let's test your setup and confirm that Sentry is working correctly and sending data to your Sentry project.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-verify" />

### View Captured Data in Sentry

Now, head over to your project on [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io/) to view the collected data (it takes a couple of moments for the data to appear).

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-verify-locate-data" />

## Next Steps

At this point, you should have integrated Sentry into your Nest.js application and should already be sending data to your Sentry project.

Now's a good time to customize your setup and look into more advanced topics.
Our next recommended steps for you are:

- Extend Sentry to your frontend using one of our [frontend SDKs](/)
- Learn how to [manually capture errors](/platforms/javascript/guides/nestjs/usage/)
- Continue to [customize your configuration](/platforms/javascript/guides/nestjs/configuration/)
- Get familiar with [Sentry's product features](/product) like tracing, insights, and alerts
