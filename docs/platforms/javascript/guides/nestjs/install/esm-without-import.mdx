<Alert>
  Are you unsure if you should use this installation method? Review our
  [installation methods](../).
</Alert>

When running your application in ESM mode, you will most likely want to <PlatformLink to="/install/esm">follow the ESM instructions</PlatformLink>. However, if you want to avoid using the `--import` command line option, for example if you have no way of configuring a CLI flag, you can also follow an alternative setup that involves importing the `instrument.mjs` file directly in your application.

<Alert level='warning' title='Restrictions of this installation method'>

This installation method has the fundamental restriction that only native Node.js APIs can be instrumented (such as `fetch` and the `http` module).

As a result, the Sentry SDK will **not** capture data from database calls, queues, ORMs, third-party libraries, or other framework-specific data.

We recommend using this only if the `--import` flag is not an option for you.

</Alert>

**Step 1:** Create a file named `instrument.mjs` that imports and initializes Sentry:

```javascript {tabTitle:ESM} {filename: instrument.mjs}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nestjs";

// Ensure to call this before importing any other modules!
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",

  // Add Tracing by setting tracesSampleRate
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

**Step 2:** Import the `instrument.mjs` file before importing any other modules in your in the `main.ts` file of your application. This ensures that Sentry can automatically instrument all modules in your application:

```javascript {filename: main.ts}
// Import this first!
import "./instrument";

// Now import other modules
import { NestFactory } from "@nestjs/core";
// ...
// Your application code goes here
```
