## How To Decide Which Installation Method To Use

Most node applications today are either written in CommonJS (CJS), or compiled to CJS before running them.
CommonJS uses `require()` to load modules. Our recommended installation method when using CommonJS is to require the `instrument.js` file at the top of your application. However, if your application is run in ESM mode, this will not work, in which case you can follow the [ESM docs](./esm).

Note that even if your application is written in ESM (using `import`), it may still be _run_ in CJS. In this case, you should follow the [CommonJS instructions](./commonjs).

### My application uses the default Nest.js setup

Nest.js transpiles to CJS by default, so you should follow the [CommonJS installation instructions](./commonjs). Keep reading if you have a more customized application or build setup.

### My application uses `require`

If you're using `require()` in your application, you should follow the [CommonJS instructions](./commonjs).

### My application uses `import`

If you're using `import` in your application, your installation method depends on how your application is _run_. If you compile your application (for example, into a `/dist` folder or similar) before running it, you need to check how the compiled code looks like. Is the compiled code using `require`? Then you should follow the [CommonJS instructions](./commonjs). If the compiled code is using `import`, you should follow the [ESM instructions](./esm).

If you do not compile your code, you'll need to follow the [ESM instructions](./esm).
