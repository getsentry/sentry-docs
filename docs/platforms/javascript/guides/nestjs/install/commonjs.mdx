  Are you unsure if you should use this installation method? Review our
  [installation methods](../).
</Alert>

Most node applications today are either written in or compiled to CommonJS (CJS), which uses `require()` to load modules.
Nest.js, by default, transpiles your TypeScript code into CommonJS.

You can follow the installation instructions in the SDK's <PlatformLink to="/">Quick Start guide</PlatformLink>.
