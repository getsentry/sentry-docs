This guide explains how to set up Sentry in your Express application.

<Alert level="warning">
  Sentry currently has limited support for Express v5.
  While error monitoring will work, tracing auto-instrumentation will lack instrumented routes for the time being.
  You may also see a warning log message in your console.
  We are working on adding full support for Express v5 in the future. For the time being, see the [Express v5 issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/13674) for details and workarounds.
