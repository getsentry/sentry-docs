Sentry's Astro SDK enables automatic reporting of errors and performance data in your Astro application.
Our Astro integration instruments both the client as well as the server side of your Astro application.
This page walks you through adding Sentry to your Astro project, configuring it, adding readable stack traces, and verifying your setup.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following:

* You need a Sentry [account](https://sentry.io/signup/) and [project](/product/projects/)
* An Astro project that uses Astro `3.0.0` or newer.
* A Node runtime:
  * This SDK currently only works on Node runtimes (e.g. Node adapter, Vercel with Lambda functions).
Non-Node runtimes, like Vercel's Edge runtime or Cloudflare Pages, are currently not supported.
* If you're using Astro's Netflify adapter (`@astrojs/netlify`), you need version `5.0.0` or newer.

## Install

<OnboardingOptionButtons options={["error-monitoring", "performance", "profiling", "session-replay"]} />

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your applicationâ€™s runtime.

Install the SDK by using the `astro` CLI:

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npx astro add @sentry/astro
```

```bash {tabTitle:yarn}
yarn astro add @sentry/astro
```

```bash {tabTitle:pnpm}
pnpm astro add @sentry/astro
```

The `astro` CLI installs the SDK package and adds the Sentry integration to your `astro.config.mjs` file.

<OnboardingOption optionId="profiling">

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install @sentry/profiling-node
```

```bash {tabTitle:yarn}
yarn add @sentry/profiling-node
```

```bash {tabTitle:pnpm}
pnpm add @sentry/profiling-node
```

</OnboardingOption>

To finish the setup, configure the Sentry integration.

## Configure

To set up the Sentry SDK, register the Sentry integration and initialize the SDK for client and server in the root directory of your project:

### Astro Integration Setup


```javascript {filename:astro.config.mjs}
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
import sentry from "@sentry/astro";

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    sentry({
      sourceMapsUploadOptions: {
        project: "___PROJECT_SLUG___",
        authToken: process.env.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN,
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

<Alert level="warning">
  Passing runtime-specific configuration options (`dsn`, `release`, `environment`, `sampleRate`, `tracesSampleRate`, `replaysSessionSampleRate`, `replaysOnErrorSampleRate`) to the Sentry integration will be deprecated in future versions.
  We recommend passing your configuration directly to the respective `Sentry.init()` calls in `sentry.client.config.js` and `sentry.server.config.js` instead.
</Alert>

### Client-Side Setup

```javascript {filename:sentry.client.config.js} {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "11,14-17", "session-replay": "12,18-25"}}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/astro";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  
  // Adds request headers and IP for users, for more info visit:
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/astro/configuration/options/#sendDefaultPii
  sendDefaultPii: true,

  integrations: [
    Sentry.browserTracingIntegration(),
    Sentry.replayIntegration(),
  ],

  // Define how likely traces are sampled. Adjust this value in production,
  // or use tracesSampler for greater control.
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,

  // This sets the sample rate to be 10%. You may want this to be 100% while
  // in development and sample at a lower rate in production
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,

  // If the entire session is not sampled, use the below sample rate to sample
  // sessions when an error occurs.
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

### Server-Side Setup

```javascript {filename:sentry.server.config.js} {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "15-18", "profiling": "2,10-14,19-22"}}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/astro";
import { nodeProfilingIntegration } from '@sentry/profiling-node';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  
  // Adds request headers and IP for users, for more info visit: for more info visit:
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/astro/configuration/options/#sendDefaultPii
  sendDefaultPii: true,
  
  integrations: [
    // Add our Profiling integration
    nodeProfilingIntegration(),
  ],

  // Define how likely traces are sampled. Adjust this value in production,
  // or use tracesSampler for greater control.
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,

  // Set sampling rate for profiling
  // This is relative to tracesSampleRate
  profilesSampleRate: 1.0
});
```

## Add Readable Stack Traces to Errors

To get readable stack traces in your production builds, set the `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable in your build environment. You can also add the environment variable to a `.env.sentry-build-plugin` file in the root of your project.

<OrgAuthTokenNote />

```bash {filename:.env.sentry-build-plugin}
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=___ORG_AUTH_TOKEN___
```

This, in combination with your `sourceMapsUploadOptions` configuration, will <PlatformLink to="/sourcemaps">upload source maps</PlatformLink> to Sentry every time you make a production build.

## Verify

This snippet includes an intentional error, so you can test that everything is working as soon as you set it up.

Trigger a test error somewhere in your Astro app, for example in one of your pages:

```html {filename: home.astro}
<button onclick="throw new Error('This is a test error')">
  Throw test error
</button>
```

<Alert>
  Errors triggered from within Browser DevTools are sandboxed and won't trigger an error handler.
  Place the snippet directly in your code instead.
</Alert>

<Alert>
  Learn more about manually capturing an error or message in our <PlatformLink to="/usage/">Usage
  documentation</PlatformLink>.
</Alert>

To view and resolve the recorded error, log into [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and select your project. Clicking on the error's title will open a page where you can see detailed information and mark it as resolved.

## Advanced Configuration Options

### Changing Config Files Location

Sentry automatically detects configuration files named `sentry.(client|server).config.js` in the root of your project. You can rename these files or move them to a custom folder within your project.
To change their location or names, specify the paths in the Sentry Astro integration options in your `astro.config.mjs`:

```javascript {filename:astro.config.mjs}
export default defineConfig({
  // Other Astro project options
  integrations: [
    sentry({
      clientInitPath: ".config/sentryClientInit.js",
      serverInitPath: ".config/sentryServerInit.js",
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Server Instrumentation

<Alert>

  Auto instrumentation only works for Astro 3.5.2 or newer. If you're using an older version, you need to [manually add the Sentry middleware](#manually-add-server-instrumentation) instead.

</Alert>

In SSR or hybrid mode configured Astro apps, the Sentry Astro integration will automatically add an [Astro middleware](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/middleware/) request handler to your server code. This middleware enhances the data collected by Sentry on the server side by:

- Collecting performance spans for incoming requests
- Enabeling distributed tracing between client and server
- Enhancing captured errors with additional information

### Manually Add Server Instrumentation

For Astro versions below 3.5.2, you need to manually add the Sentry middleware to your `src/middleware.js` file:

```javascript {filename:src/middleware.(js|ts)}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/astro";
import { sequence } from "astro:middleware";

export const onRequest = sequence(
  Sentry.handleRequest()
  // other middleware handlers
);
```

If you have multiple request handlers, make sure to add the Sentry middleware as the first handler in the sequence.

### Customize Server Instrumentation

Sentry's Astro middleware gives you control over what additional data should be added to the recorded request spans.

To customize the server instrumentation, add the Sentry middleware to your `src/middleware.js` file:

```javascript {filename:src/middleware.(js|ts)}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/astro";
import { sequence } from "astro:middleware";

export const onRequest = sequence(
  Sentry.handleRequest({
    trackClientIp: true, // defaults to false
    trackHeaders: true, // defaults to false
  })
  // other middleware handlers
);
```

If you're using Astro 3.5.2 or newer, make sure to also disable auto instrumentation as shown below.

### Disable Auto Server Instrumentation

For Astro 3.5.2 or newer, you can disable the automatic server instrumentation by turning off the `requestHandler` auto instrumentation option:

```javascript {filename:astro.config.mjs}
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
import sentry from "@sentry/astro";

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    sentry({
      autoInstrumentation: {
        requestHandler: false,
      },
    }),
  ],
  output: "server",
});
```
