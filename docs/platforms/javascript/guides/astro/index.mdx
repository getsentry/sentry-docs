## Prerequisites

You need:

- A Sentry [account](https://sentry.io/signup/) and [project](/product/projects/)
- Your application up and running
- Astro `3.0.0` or above
- If you're using Astro's Netlify adapter (`@astrojs/netlify`), you need version `5.0.0` or above

<Alert level="warning" title="What runtime do you use?">
  This SDK currently only works on Node runtimes, such as Node adapter or Vercel
  with Lambda functions. If you use Cloudflare Pages, refer to our [Astro on
  Cloudflare guide](/platforms/javascript/guides/cloudflare/frameworks/astro/).
  Other non-Node runtimes, like Vercel's Edge runtime, are currently **not
  supported**.
