_(Available in version [9.32.0](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/releases/tag/9.32.0) and above)_

You can use the `instrumentWorkflowWithSentry` method to instrument [Cloudflare
Workflows](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/).

Because workflows can be hibernated and loose all state, we use the workflows
`instanceId` as the Sentry `trace_id` to link all steps together. We also use
the last 4 characters of the `instanceId` for sampling to ensure all steps have
the same sampling decision. If you are starting your workflows with a custom
`instanceId`, ensure you use valid random UUIDs either with or without dashes.

```typescript
import { WorkflowEntrypoint, WorkflowStep, WorkflowEvent } from 'cloudflare:workers';
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/cloudflare";

class MyWorkflowBase extends WorkflowEntrypoint<Env, Params> {
  async run(event: WorkflowEvent<Params>, step: WorkflowStep) {
    await step.do('fetch data', async () => {
      //
    });

    await step.do('process data', async () => {
      //
    });
  }
}

// Export your named class as defined in your wrangler config
export const MyWorkflow = Sentry.instrumentWorkflowWithSentry(
  (env: Env) => ({
    dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  }),
  MyWorkflowBase
);
```
