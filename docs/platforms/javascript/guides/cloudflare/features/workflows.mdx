_(Available in version [9.32.0](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/releases/tag/9.32.0) and above)_

You can use the `instrumentWorkflowWithSentry` method to instrument [Cloudflare
Workflows](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/).

Because workflows can be hibernated and lose all state, we use the workflows
`instanceId` to generate the Sentry `trace_id` to link all steps together into a
single trace. If `instanceId` is a UUID (with or without dashes), it will be
used directly as the `trace_id`. If not, we SHA1 hash the `instanceId` to
generate a deterministic `trace_id`. 

We use the last 4 characters of the `trace_id` for sampling to ensure all steps
have the same sampling decision. 

Because the `instanceId` is used for both the `trace_id` and for sampling
decisions, you should ensure that the `instanceId` is unique for each workflow
instance. If you are using custom UUIDs, you should ensure the last 4 digits are
sufficiently random to ensure a good distribution of sampling decisions.

```typescript
import { WorkflowEntrypoint, WorkflowStep, WorkflowEvent } from 'cloudflare:workers';
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/cloudflare";

class MyWorkflowBase extends WorkflowEntrypoint<Env, Params> {
  async run(event: WorkflowEvent<Params>, step: WorkflowStep) {
    await step.do('fetch data', async () => {
      //
    });

    await step.do('process data', async () => {
      //
    });
  }
}

// Export your named class as defined in your wrangler config
export const MyWorkflow = Sentry.instrumentWorkflowWithSentry(
  (env: Env) => ({
    dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  }),
  MyWorkflowBase
);
```
