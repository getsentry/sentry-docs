## Install

If you're running your Astro app on Cloudflare Pages, you can use the Sentry Astro SDK in combination with the Sentry Cloudflare SDK to add Sentry instrumentation.

First, install the Sentry Astro SDK in your application. We recommend [setting up the Astro SDK manually](/platforms/javascript/guides/astro/manual-setup/) and manually initializing the SDK. Make sure you have a `sentry.client.config.js` file created, but do not add a `sentry.server.config.js` file.

After installing the Sentry Astro SDK, you can now install the Sentry Cloudflare SDK. First, install the SDK with your package manager:

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-install" />

## Setup

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-config" />

Then create a `functions` directory and add a `_middleware.js` file to it with the following code:

```javascript {filename:functions/_middleware.js}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/cloudflare";

export const onRequest = [
  // Make sure Sentry is the first middleware
  Sentry.sentryPagesPlugin((context) => ({
    dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100% of spans for tracing.
    // Learn more at
    // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/options/#traces-sample-rate
    tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  })),
  // Add more middlewares here
];
```
