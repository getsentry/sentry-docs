<Alert type="warning" title="Community Middleware Deprecation">
  The community-maintained `@hono/sentry` middleware that uses `toucan-js` has been deprecated in favor of 
  using `@sentry/cloudflare` directly. 
  If you're currently using the `@hono/sentry` middleware with `toucan-js`, you should migrate to 
  `@sentry/cloudflare` directly as shown in this guide.
</Alert>

## Step 1: Install

Choose the features you want to configure, and this guide will show you how:

<OnboardingOptionButtons
  options={["error-monitoring", "performance", "logs"]}
/>

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-features-expandable" />

### Install the Sentry SDK

Run the command for your preferred package manager to add the Sentry SDK to your application:

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-install" />

## Step 2: Configure

The main Sentry configuration should happen as early as possible in your app's lifecycle.

### Wrangler Configuration

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-config" />

### Initialize the Sentry SDK

<PlatformContent
  includePath="getting-started-config"
  platform="javascript.cloudflare.workers"
/>

### Migration from Community Middleware

If you're currently using the `@hono/sentry` middleware, migrate to the official `@sentry/cloudflare` middleware:

```javascript
// New approach using official Sentry SDK
import { Hono } from 'hono';
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/cloudflare';

const app = new Hono();

// Wrap your app with Sentry
export default Sentry.withSentry(
  (env: Env) => ({
    dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
    tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  }),
  app
);
```

<PlatformContent
  includePath="getting-started-capture-errors"
  platform="javascript.hono"
/>

## Step 3: Add Readable Stack Traces With Source Maps (Optional)

<PlatformContent
  includePath="getting-started-sourcemaps-short-version"
  platform="javascript.hono"
/>

## Step 4: Verify Your Setup

<PlatformContent
  includePath="getting-started-verify"
  platform="javascript.hono"
/>

## Next Steps

At this point, you should have integrated Sentry and should already be sending data to your Sentry project.

Now's a good time to customize your setup and look into more advanced topics. Our next recommended steps for you are:

- Learn how to [manually capture errors](/platforms/javascript/guides/cloudflare/usage/)
- Continue to [customize your configuration](/platforms/javascript/guides/cloudflare/configuration/)
- Make use of [Cloudflare-specific features](/platforms/javascript/guides/cloudflare/features)
- Get familiar with [Sentry's product features](/product) like tracing, insights, and alerts
