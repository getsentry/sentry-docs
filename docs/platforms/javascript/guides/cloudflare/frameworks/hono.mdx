## Step 1: Install

Choose the features you want to configure, and this guide will show you how:

<OnboardingOptionButtons
  options={["error-monitoring", "performance", "logs"]}
/>

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-features-expandable" />

### Install the Sentry SDK

Run the command for your preferred package manager to add the Sentry SDK to your application:

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-install" />

## Step 2: Configure

The main Sentry configuration should happen as early as possible in your app's lifecycle.

### Wrangler Configuration

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-config" />

### Initialize the Sentry SDK

<PlatformContent
  includePath="getting-started-config"
  platform="javascript.cloudflare.workers"
/>

<PlatformContent
  includePath="getting-started-capture-errors"
  platform="javascript.hono"
/>

## Step 3: Add Readable Stack Traces With Source Maps (Optional)

<PlatformContent
  includePath="getting-started-sourcemaps-short-version"
  platform="javascript.hono"
/>

## Step 4: Verify Your Setup

<PlatformContent
  includePath="getting-started-verify"
  platform="javascript.hono"
/>

## Next Steps

At this point, you should have integrated Sentry and should already be sending data to your Sentry project.

Now's a good time to customize your setup and look into more advanced topics. Our next recommended steps for you are:

- Learn how to [manually capture errors](/platforms/javascript/guides/cloudflare/usage/)
- Continue to [customize your configuration](/platforms/javascript/guides/cloudflare/configuration/)
- Make use of [Cloudflare-specific features](/platforms/javascript/guides/cloudflare/features)
- Get familiar with [Sentry's product features](/product) like tracing, insights, and alerts
