If you're running your Nuxt app on Cloudflare Pages, you'll need to configure the Sentry Nuxt SDK slightly differently than the default setup.
This guide will show you how to set up the SDK with Nitro's `cloudflare-pages` deployment preset.

## Install

First, install the Sentry Nuxt SDK in your application. We recommend using the Sentry wizard to automatically install the SDK:

```bash
npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i nuxt
```

If the setup through the wizard doesn't work for you, you can also [set up the Nuxt SDK manually](/platforms/javascript/guides/nuxt/manual-setup/).

<Alert>

If you installed the SDK before, make sure that `@sentry/nuxt` version `9.34.0` or newer is installed.

</Alert>

Now you can install the Sentry Cloudflare SDK with your package manager:

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-install" />

## Setup

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-config" />

### Adding the Nitro Plugin

To enable Sentry for your Nuxt app on Cloudflare, follow these steps:

1. Delete the previous server config file `sentry.server.config.ts` if it exists.

2. Create a new file in `server/plugins` and add the following code to your plugin file:

```TypeScript {filename:server/plugins/sentry-cloudflare-plugin.ts}
import { sentryCloudflareNitroPlugin } from '@sentry/nuxt/module/plugins'

export default defineNitroPlugin(sentryCloudflareNitroPlugin({
  dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
}))
```

Or, if you need access to `nitroApp`:

```TypeScript {filename:server/plugins/sentry-cloudflare-plugin.ts}
import { sentryCloudflareNitroPlugin } from '@sentry/nuxt/module/plugins'

export default defineNitroPlugin(sentryCloudflareNitroPlugin((nitroApp: NitroApp) => {
  // You can access `nitroApp` here if needed
  return {
    dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
    tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  }
}))
```
