description: "Learn how to add Cloudflare instrumentation to your SvelteKit app."
---

If you're running your SvelteKit app on Cloudflare Pages, you can use the Sentry SvelteKit SDK in combination with the Sentry Cloudflare SDK to add Sentry instrumentation.

First, install the Sentry SvelteKit SDK in your application. We recommend using the Sentry wizard to automatically install the SDK:

```bash
npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i sveltekit
```

If the setup through the wizard doesn't work for you, you can also [set up the SvelteKit SDK manually](/platforms/javascript/guides/sveltekit/manual-setup/).

After installing the Sentry SvelteKit SDK, you can move on to setting up the Cloudflare SDK. First, install the SDK with your package manager:

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-install" />

To use the SDK, you'll need to set either the `nodejs_compat` or `nodejs_als` compatibility flags in your `wrangler.toml`. This is because the SDK
needs access to the `AsyncLocalStorage` API to work correctly.

```toml {filename:wrangler.toml}
compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]
# compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_als"]
```

To use this SDK, update your `src/hooks.server.(ts|js)` file to use the `Sentry.wrapRequestHandler` method from the Sentry Cloudflare SDK and remove the `Sentry.init` call from `@sentry/sveltekit`.

```typescript diff {filename:hooks.server.(ts|js)}
 import { sequence } from "@sveltejs/kit/hooks";
 import { handleErrorWithSentry, sentryHandle } from "@sentry/sveltekit";
-import * as Sentry from '@sentry/sveltekit';
+import * as Sentry from "@sentry/cloudflare";

-Sentry.init({
-  dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
-  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
-
-  // uncomment the line below to enable Spotlight (https://spotlightjs.com)
-  // spotlight: import.meta.env.DEV,
-});
-
+const handleInitSentry = ({ event, resolve }) => {
+  return event.platform
+    ? Sentry.wrapRequestHandler(
+        {
+          options: {
+            dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
+            tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
+          },
+          request: event.request,
+          context: event.platform.ctx,
+        },
+        () => resolve(event)
+      )
+    : resolve(event);
+};
-// If you have custom handlers, make sure to place them after `sentryHandle()` in the `sequence` function.
-export const handle = sequence(sentryHandle());
+export const handle = sequence(handleInitSentry, sentryHandle());

export const handleError = handleErrorWithSentry(myErrorHandler);
```

If you need to use environmental variables, you can access them using `event.platform.env`.
