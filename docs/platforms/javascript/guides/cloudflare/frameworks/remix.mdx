If you're running your Remix app on Cloudflare Pages, you can use the Sentry Remix SDK in combination with the Sentry Cloudflare SDK to add Sentry instrumentation.

## Install

First, install the Sentry Remix SDK in your application. We recommend using the Sentry wizard to automatically install the SDK:

```bash
npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i remix
```

If the setup through the wizard doesn't work for you, you can also [set up the Remix SDK manually](/platforms/javascript/guides/remix/manual-setup/).

After installing the Sentry Remix SDK, delete the newly generated `instrumentation.server.mjs` file. This instrumentation is not needed when using the Cloudflare SDK.

Now you can install the Sentry Cloudflare SDK. First, install the SDK with your package manager:

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-install" />

## Setup

The main Sentry configuration should happen as early as possible in your app's lifecycle.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-config" />

Then create a `_middleware.js` file in your `functions` directory and add the following code:

```javascript {filename:functions/_middleware.js}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/cloudflare";

export const onRequest = [
  // Make sure Sentry is the first middleware
  Sentry.sentryPagesPlugin((context) => ({
    dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100% of spans for tracing.
    tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  })),
  // Add more middlewares here
];
```
