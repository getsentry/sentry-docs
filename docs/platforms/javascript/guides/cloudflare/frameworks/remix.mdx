If you're running your Remix app on Cloudflare Pages, you can use the Sentry Remix SDK in combination with the Sentry Cloudflare SDK to add Sentry instrumentation.

## 1. Installing Sentry Remix SDK

First, install the Sentry Remix SDK in your application. We recommend using the Sentry wizard to automatically install the SDK:

```bash
npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i remix
```

If the setup through the wizard doesn't work for you, you can also [set up the Remix SDK manually](/platforms/javascript/guides/remix/manual-setup/).

## 2. Installing Sentry Cloudflare SDK

After installing the Sentry Remix SDK, delete the newly generated `instrumentation.server.mjs` file. This instrumentation is not needed when using the Cloudflare SDK.

Now you can install the Sentry Cloudflare SDK. First, install the SDK with your package manager:

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-install" />

To use the SDK, you'll need to set either the `nodejs_also` or `nodejs_compat` compatibility flags in your `wrangler.jsonc`/`wrangler.toml` config. This is because the SDK
needs access to the `AsyncLocalStorage` API to work correctly.

```jsonc {tabTitle:JSON} {filename:wrangler.jsonc}
{
  "compatibility_flags": [
    "nodejs_also",
    // "nodejs_compat"
  ],
}
```

```toml {tabTitle:Toml} {filename:wrangler.toml}
compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_also"]
# compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]
```

Then create a `_middleware.js` file in your `functions` directory and add the following code:

```javascript {filename:functions/_middleware.js}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/cloudflare";

export const onRequest = [
  // Make sure Sentry is the first middleware
  Sentry.sentryPagesPlugin((context) => ({
    dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100% of spans for tracing.
    tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  })),
  // Add more middlewares here
];
```
