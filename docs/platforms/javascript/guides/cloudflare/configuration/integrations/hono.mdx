_Import name: `Sentry.honoIntegration`_

This integration is enabled by default. If you'd like to modify your default integrations, read [this](./../#modifying-default-integrations).

The `honoIntegration` automatically captures errors from Hono's `onError` function and sends them to Sentry. By default, the integration won't capture errors that have a 3xx or 4xx HTTP status code.

## Options

You can configure the `honoIntegration` by passing an options object to the function.

### `shouldHandleError`

This option allows you to provide a function that determines whether an error should be captured, giving you full control over which errors are sent to Sentry.

The function receives the error as an argument and should return `true` if the error should be reported, and `false` otherwise.

For example, to report all errors except for 404s, add this to the integrations array when initializing Sentry:

```javascript
integrations: [
  honoIntegration({
    shouldHandleError(error) {
      // return true // Would report all errors

      if (error instanceof HTTPException && error.status === 404) {
        // Don't report 404s
        return false;
      }
      // Report all other errors
      return true;
    },
  }),
]
```
