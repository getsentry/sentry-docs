<Alert level="warning">
  This SDK is currently in **beta**. Beta features are still in progress and may have bugs. Please reach out on
  [GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/new/choose) if you have any feedback or concerns.
</Alert>

Sentry's Nuxt SDK enables automatic reporting of errors and performance data.

## Compatibility

The Sentry Nuxt SDK supports Nuxt version `3.7.0` and above. For best results, we recommend
using Nuxt `3.14.0` or later, which includes updated dependencies critical to the SDK's functionality.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-prerequisites" />

## Install

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your applicationâ€™s runtime.

We recommend installing the SDK by running our installation wizard in the root directory of your project:

```bash
npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i nuxt
```

The wizard will prompt you to log in to Sentry. It will then automatically do the following steps for you:

- create or update Nuxt files with the default Sentry configuration:
  - `sentry.(client|server).config.ts` to initialize the SDK
  - `nuxt.config.ts` to add build options to add source maps upload and auto-instrumentation via Vite plugins.
- create a `.env.sentry-build-plugin` file with an auth token to upload source maps (this file is automatically added to `.gitignore`)
- add an example page to your frontend app and your server to verify your Sentry setup

After the wizard setup is completed, the SDK will automatically capture unhandled errors, and monitor performance.

You can also <PlatformLink to="/usage/">manually capture errors</PlatformLink>.

<Alert>
  If the setup through the wizard doesn't work for you, you can also <PlatformLink to="/manual-setup/">set up the SDK manually</PlatformLink>.
</Alert>

## Configure

Configuration should happen as early as possible in your application's lifecycle.

To complete your configuration, add <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/">options</PlatformLink> to your `Sentry.init()` calls.

Here, you'll also be able to set context data, which includes data about the <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/identify-user/">user</PlatformLink>, <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/tags/">tags</PlatformLink>, or even <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/context/">arbitrary data</PlatformLink>, all of which will be added to every event sent to Sentry.

## Verify

This snippet includes an intentional error, so you can test that everything is working as soon as you set it up.

### Server-side

Sentry can only be loaded on the server-side by being explicitly added via `--import`.
Check out the <PlatformLink to="/install/cli-import">`--import` CLI flag</PlatformLink> docs for setup instructions.

To verify that Sentry works on the server-side, add the following snippet on the server-side:

```js {tabTitle:Nitro} {filename:server/api/sentry-example.get.ts}
export default defineEventHandler(event => {
  throw new Error("Sentry Example API Route Error");
});
```

If you want to test server-side monitoring locally, build your project and run:
  ```
  # Start your app after building your project with `nuxi build`
  node --import ./.output/server/sentry.server.config.mjs .output/server/index.mjs
  ```

<Alert level="warning">
  Sentry server-side monitoring **doesn't work in development mode!**

  If you experience any issues with the server-side setup, check out <PlatformLink to="/troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</PlatformLink>
  or read through the different <PlatformLink to="/install">installation methods</PlatformLink>.
</Alert>

### Client-side

Add the following snippet on the client-side:

```html {tabTitle:Vue} {filename:pages/example-error.vue}
<script setup>
  import * as Sentry from '@sentry/nuxt';

  function triggerClientError() {
    throw new Error("Nuxt Button Error");
  };

  function getSentryData() {
    Sentry.startSpan(
      {
        name: 'Example Frontend Span',
        op: 'test'
      },
      async () => {
        await $fetch('/api/sentry-example');
      }
    )
  }
</script>

<template>
  <button id="errorBtn" @click="triggerClientError">
    Throw Client Error
  </button>
  <button type="button" @click="getSentryData">
    Throw Server Error
  </button>
</template>
```

<Alert>

Learn more about manually capturing an error or message in our <PlatformLink to="/usage/">Usage documentation</PlatformLink>.

</Alert>

To view and resolve the recorded error, log into [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and select your project. Clicking on the error's title will open a page where you can see detailed information and mark it as resolved.
