The Sentry Nuxt SDK automatically instruments various Nitro server APIs to provide performance monitoring and error tracking for your server-side code.

## Server Middleware

<Alert>Available from version `@sentry/nuxt` 10.17.0 and up.</Alert>

The Sentry Nuxt SDK automatically instruments [server middleware handlers](https://nuxt.com/docs/4.x/guide/directory-structure/server#server-middleware) in addition to server event handlers. This includes the handler functions and their `onBeforeResponse` and `onRequest` callbacks.

## Cache

<Alert>Available from version `@sentry/nuxt` 10.21.0 and up.</Alert>

The Sentry Nuxt SDK automatically instruments [cache APIs](https://nitro.build/guide/cache) for the following Nitro functions:

- `defineCachedEventHandler`
- `cachedEventHandler`
- `cachedFunction`

This provides spans in your transactions that represent cache operations and their durations, including cache hits.

## Storage

<Alert>Available from version `@sentry/nuxt` 10.21.0 and up.</Alert>

The Sentry Nuxt SDK automatically instruments [storage APIs](https://nuxt.com/docs/4.x/guide/directory-structure/server#server-storage) (also known as KV storage) and common operations.

Keep in mind that only the storage mounts configured under `nitro.storage` in your `nuxt.config.ts` will be instrumented. Storage spans will show up in a similar way to [cache](#cache) spans since they both utilize the same underlying Nitro storage API.

## Database

<Alert>Available from version `@sentry/nuxt` 10.21.0 and up.</Alert>

The Sentry Nuxt SDK automatically instruments Nitro's [database API](https://nitro.build/guide/database). This provides spans in your transactions that represent database query operations and their durations, enabling you to identify slow queries, track query frequency, and optimize your database interactions.

Database instrumentation only applies to database mounts configured under `nitro.database` in your `nuxt.config.ts` and only when `nitro.experimental.database` is set to `true`.
