---

The Sentry Nuxt SDK automatically instruments various Nitro server APIs to provide performance monitoring and error tracking for your server-side code.

## Server Middleware

<Alert>
  Server middleware instrumentation is available from version `@sentry/nuxt`
  10.17.0 and up.
</Alert>

The Sentry Nuxt SDK automatically instruments [server middleware handlers](https://nuxt.com/docs/4.x/guide/directory-structure/server#server-middleware) in addition to server event handlers.

## Storage

<Alert>
  Storage instrumentation is available from version `@sentry/nuxt` 10.21.0 and
  up.
</Alert>

The Sentry Nuxt SDK automatically instruments [storage APIs](https://nuxt.com/docs/4.x/guide/directory-structure/server#server-storage) (also known as KV storage) and common operations.

<Alert>

Only the storage mounts configured under `nitro.storage` in your `nuxt.config.ts` will be instrumented.

</Alert>

## Cache

<Alert>
  Cache instrumentation is available from version `@sentry/nuxt` 10.21.0 and up.
</Alert>

The Sentry Nuxt SDK automatically instruments [cache APIs](https://nitro.build/guide/cache) for the following Nitro functions:

- `defineCachedEventHandler`
- `cachedEventHandler`
- `cachedFunction`

This provides spans in your transactions that represent cache operations and their durations, including cache hits.

## Database

<Alert>
  Database instrumentation is available from version `@sentry/nuxt` 10.21.0 and
  up.
</Alert>

The Sentry Nuxt SDK automatically instruments [database APIs](https://nitro.build/guide/database). This provides spans in your transactions that represent database query operations and their durations, enabling you to identify slow queries, track query frequency, and optimize your database interactions.

<Alert>

Database instrumentation only applies to database mounts configured under `nitro.database` in your `nuxt.config.ts` and only when `nitro.experimental.database` is set to `true`.

</Alert>
