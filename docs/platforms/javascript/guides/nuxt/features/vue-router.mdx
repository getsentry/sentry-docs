Nuxt uses the `vue-router` under the hood, and the Sentry Nuxt SDK automatically instruments it to create parameterized transaction names for your page loads and navigations. For example, a navigation to `/users/123` will be captured as a transaction named `/users/:id`.

This feature is enabled by default and requires no additional configuration.
