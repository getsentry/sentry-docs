## Understanding the `import()` expression

The `import()` expression (also called "dynamic import") allows conditional and flexible module loading in ESM.
For the Sentry Nuxt SDK, it provides an approach to initialize server-side configuration before application startup.
This early initialization is required to set up the SDK's instrumentation of various libraries correctly.

## Initializing Sentry with Dynamic `import()`

By default, the Sentry Nuxt SDK includes a Rollup plugin which wraps the server entry file with a dynamic `import()`.
With this, Sentry can be initialized before all other modules of the application.

The server entry file will look something like this:

```javascript {filename:.output/server/index.mjs}
// Note: file may have some imports and code related to debug IDs
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "..."
});

import('./chunks/nitro/nitro.mjs').then(function (n) { return n.r; });
```

## Scenarios where `import()` doesn't work

We are currently investigating an issue where the server-side is not correctly initialized with a recent update of Nitro (the server-side toolkit in Nuxt).
We are working on figuring this out ([see issue here](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/14514)). As a temporary workaround, you can add the following overrides to your application:

```json {tabTitle:npm} {filename:package.json}
"overrides": {
  "nitropack": "~2.9.7",
  "@vercel/nft": "^0.27.4"
}
```
```json {tabTitle:yarn} {filename:package.json}
"resolutions": {
  "nitropack": "~2.9.7",
  "@vercel/nft": "^0.27.4"
}
```
```json {tabTitle:pnpm} {filename:package.json}
"pnpm": {
  "overrides": {
    "nitropack": "~2.9.7",
    "@vercel/nft": "^0.27.4"
  }
}
```

You can also check out the guide for using the <PlatformLink to="/install/cli-import//">CLI flag `--import`</PlatformLink> as this might be a better choice for you.


## Re-exporting serverless handler functions

Sentry automatically detects serverless handler functions in the build output and re-exports them from the server entry file.

By default, Sentry re-exports functions named `handler`, `server`, and `default` exports. This will work in most cases and no other action is required.
In case your serverless function has another, custom name you can override this with `entrypointWrappedFunctions`:


```javascript {filename: nuxt.config.ts} {7}
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ["@sentry/nuxt/module"],

  sentry: {
    // Customize detected function names
    // Default value: ['default', 'handler', 'server']
    entrypointWrappedFunctions: ['customFunctionName']
  },
});
```
