## Understanding the `import()` expression

<Alert level='warning'>
  This installation method doesn't work with more recent versions of Nuxt/Nitro.

  We recommend reading the guide for installing the SDK with the <PlatformLink to="/install/cli-import">CLI flag `--import`</PlatformLink> or <PlatformLink to="/install/limited-server-tracing">limited server tracing</PlatformLink>
</Alert>

The `import()` expression, or dynamic import, enables flexible, conditional module loading in ESM.
Node.js will generate a separate module graph for any code wrapped in a dynamic `import()`. This separate graph is evaluated **after** all modules, which are statically `import`ed.

By using the Sentry Nuxt SDK, the server-side application will be wrapped in a dynamic `import()`, while the Sentry configuration will be imported with a static `import`.
This makes it possible to initialize the Sentry Nuxt SDK at startup, while the Nitro server runtime loads later because it is `import()`ed.
This early initialization of Sentry is required to correctly set up the SDK's instrumentation of various libraries.

## Scenarios where `import()` doesn't work

Depending on your setup and which version of Nitro is used, the server-side is sometimes not correctly initialized.
The build output **must not** include a regular `import` of the Nitro runtime (e.g. `import './chunks/nitro/nitro.mjs'`).
See the ([GitHub issue here](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/14514)) for more information.

As a temporary workaround, you can add the following overrides in your application:

```json {tabTitle:npm} {filename:package.json}
"overrides": {
  "nitropack": "~2.9.7",
  "@vercel/nft": "^0.27.4"
}
```
```json {tabTitle:yarn} {filename:package.json}
"resolutions": {
  "nitropack": "~2.9.7",
  "@vercel/nft": "^0.27.4"
}
```
```json {tabTitle:pnpm} {filename:package.json}
"pnpm": {
  "overrides": {
    "nitropack": "~2.9.7",
    "@vercel/nft": "^0.27.4"
  }
}
```

You can also check out the guide for installing the SDK with the <PlatformLink to="/install/cli-import">CLI flag `--import`</PlatformLink> or <PlatformLink to="/install/limited-server-tracing">limited-server-tracing</PlatformLink>.

## Initializing Sentry with Dynamic `import()`

Enable the dynamic `import()` by setting `autoInjectServerSentry`:

```typescript {filename:nuxt.config.ts} {3}
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  sentry: {
    autoInjectServerSentry: 'experimental_dynamic-import'
  },
})
```

After setting this, the Sentry Nuxt SDK will add build-time configuration so that your app will be wrapped with `import()`,
ensuring that Sentry can be initialized before any other modules.

The Nuxt server entry file will look something like this:

```javascript {filename:.output/server/index.mjs}
// Note: The file may have some imports and code, related to debug IDs
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "..."
});

import('./chunks/nitro/nitro.mjs').then(function (n) { return n.r; });
```

## Re-exporting serverless handler functions

Sentry automatically detects serverless handler functions in the build output and re-exports them from the server entry file.

By default, Sentry re-exports functions named `handler`, `server`, and `default` exports. This will work in most cases and no other action is required.
If your serverless function has a custom name, you can override it with `experimental_entrypointWrappedFunctions`:

```javascript {filename: nuxt.config.ts} {7}
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ["@sentry/nuxt/module"],

  sentry: {
    // Customize detected function names
    // Default value: ['default', 'handler', 'server']
    experimental_entrypointWrappedFunctions: ['customFunctionName']
  },
});
```
