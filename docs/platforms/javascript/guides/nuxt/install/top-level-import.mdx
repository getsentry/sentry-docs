## Understanding Top-level `import`

Sentry needs to be initialized before the application starts.
If the default way of adding an <PlatformLink to="/install/cli-import">`--import` CLI flag</PlatformLink> flag does not work for you,
set up the SDK for adding a top-level `import`. This will import the Sentry server-side config at the top of the Nuxt server entry file.
In this case, Sentry isnâ€™t initialized before the app starts, but is set up as early as possible.

<Alert level='warning' title='Restrictions of this installation method'>
  This installation method has fundamental restrictions:
  - It only supports limited performance instrumentation.
  - Only basic `http` instrumentation will work.
  - No DB or framework-specific instrumentation will be available.

  We recommend using this only if the `--import` flag is not an option for you.
</Alert>

## Initializing Sentry With a Top-level `import`

Enable the top-level `import` by setting `autoInjectServerSentry`:

```typescript {filename:nuxt.config.ts} {3}
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  sentry: {
    autoInjectServerSentry: 'top-level-import'
  },
})
```

By default, the SDK will add the Sentry server config to the build output (typically, `.output/server/sentry.server.config.mjs`).

With the top-level `import`, the Nuxt server entry file will look something like this:

```javascript {filename:.output/server/index.mjs}
import './sentry.server.config.mjs';
// Note: The file may have some imports and code, related to debug IDs
```
