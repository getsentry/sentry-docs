## Understanding the `--import` CLI Flag

The [`--import` CLI flag](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--importmodule) in Node allows you to preload modules before the application starts.
If you cannot use the SDK's <PlatformLink to="/install/dynamic-import/">default dynamic import behaviour</PlatformLink>, setting
this flag is crucial for ensuring proper server-side initialization, as Sentry needs to be initialized before the rest of the application runs.

## Scenarios where `--import` does not work

- You're not able to add Node CLI flags or environment variables that are scoped to the function runtime
- As of now, Netlify only supports adding scoped environment variables in the paid plan
- As of now, Vercel does not provide an option for scoping environment variables

If any of those points apply to you, you cannot use the `--import` flag to initialize Sentry on the server-side.
Check out the guide for using <PlatformLink to="/install/dynamic-import/">dynamic import</PlatformLink> instead.

## Initializing Sentry with `--import`

To successfully use the `--import` flag, follow these steps:

### 1. Disable Dynamic Import

First, disable the dynamic import by setting `dynamicImportForServerEntry` to `false`:

```javascript {filename: nuxt.config.ts} {5}
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ["@sentry/nuxt/module"],

  sentry: {
    dynamicImportForServerEntry: false,
  },
});
```

By disabling the dynamic import, the SDK will add the Sentry server config to the build output (typically `.output/server/sentry.server.config.mjs`).

### 2. Adding `--import` to `node` command

After building your Nuxt app with `nuxi build`, add the `--import` flag followed by the Sentry server config path to the `node` command.
With the default Nitro Node preset, this typically looks like this:

```bash
node --import ./.output/server/sentry.server.config.mjs .output/server/index.mjs
```

Check the log at the very end of the console output after building the application.
This will print the node command with the server entry path for your application (`node .output/server/index.mjs` with the Node preset).
Make sure to update the paths accordingly, especially when using a different Nitro preset.

To make things easier, add a script in the `package.json`:

```json {filename:package.json}
{
  "scripts": {
    "preview": "NODE_OPTIONS='--import .//server/sentry.server.config.mjs' nuxt preview",
    "start": "node --import ./.output/server/sentry.server.config.mjs .output/server/index.mjs"
  }
}
```

### 3. Adding `--import` flag in production

To be able to set up Sentry in production, the `--import` flag needs to be added wherever you run your application's production build output.
Consult your hosting provider's documentation for specific implementation details.
Most deployment platforms support this through two primary methods:

#### Option 1: Direct CLI Flag
```bash
node --import .output/server/sentry.server.config.mjs your-server-entry.mjs
```

#### Option 2: Environment Variable
```bash
NODE_OPTIONS='--import .output/server/sentry.server.config.mjs'
```
