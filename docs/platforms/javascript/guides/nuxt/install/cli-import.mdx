## Understanding the `--import` CLI Flag

The [`--import` CLI flag](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--importmodule) in Node is the default way in ESM to preload a module before the application starts.
Setting this flag is crucial for ensuring proper server-side initialization, as Sentry needs to be initialized before
Node.js resolves the entire import graph of your application. This is necessary for enabling proper instrumentation of ESM module

## Scenarios where `--import` does not work

- You're not able to add Node CLI flags or environment variables scoped to the function runtime, meaning these variables are not applied in other scopes, such as build time.
- You don't know the path to the Nuxt server folder in the build output
- On **Netlify**, it is as of now not possible to configure `--import` properly.
- On **Vercel**, it is as of now not possible to configure `--import` properly.

If any of those points apply to you, you cannot use the `--import` flag to initialize Sentry on the server-side.
Check out the guide for using <PlatformLink to="/install/limited-server-tracing">limited server tracing</PlatformLink> instead.

## Initializing Sentry with `--import`

By default, the SDK will add the Sentry server config to the build output (typically, `.output/server/sentry.server.config.mjs`).

### 1. Adding `--import` to `node` command

After building your Nuxt app with `nuxi build`, add the `--import` flag followed by the Sentry server config path to the `node` command.
With the default Nitro Node preset, this typically looks like this:

```bash
node --import ./.output/server/sentry.server.config.mjs .output/server/index.mjs
```

Check the log at the very end of the console output after building the application.
This will print the node command with the server entry path for your application (`node .output/server/index.mjs` with the Node preset).
Make sure to update the paths accordingly, especially when using a different Nitro preset.

To make things easier, add a script in the `package.json`:

```json {filename:package.json}
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node --import ./.output/server/sentry.server.config.mjs .output/server/index.mjs"
  }
}
```

### 2. Adding `--import` flag in production

To be able to set up Sentry in production, the `--import` flag needs to be added wherever you run your application's production build output.
Consult your hosting provider's documentation for specific implementation details.
Most deployment platforms support this through two primary methods:

#### Option 1: Direct CLI Flag
```bash
node --import .output/server/sentry.server.config.mjs your-server-entry.mjs
```

#### Option 2: Environment Variable
```bash
NODE_OPTIONS='--import .output/server/sentry.server.config.mjs'
```
