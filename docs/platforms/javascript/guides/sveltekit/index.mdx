## Step 1: Install

To install Sentry using the installation wizard, run the following command within your project:

```bash
npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i sveltekit
```

The wizard then guides you through the setup process, asking you to enable additional (optional) Sentry features for your application beyond error monitoring.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-features-expandable" />

This guide assumes that you enable all features and allow the wizard to create an example page. You can add or remove features at any time, but setting them up now will save you the effort of configuring them manually later.

<Expandable title="What does the installation wizard change inside your application?">

- Creates or updates `hooks.(client|server).js` to initialize the SDK and instrument [SvelteKit's hooks](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/hooks)
- Creates or updates `vite.config.js` to add source maps upload and auto-instrumentation via Vite plugins
- If you're on SvelteKit `2.31.0` or higher:
  - Creates `instrumentation.server.js` to initialize the server-side SDK
  - Enables server-side instrumentation and tracing in `svelte.config.js`
- Creates `.env.sentry-build-plugin` with an auth token to upload source maps (this file is automatically added to `.gitignore`)
- Adds an example page to your application to help verify your Sentry setup

## Step 2: Avoid Ad Blockers With Tunneling (Optional)

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-tunneling" />

## Step 3: Verify Your Setup

If you haven't tested your Sentry configuration yet, let's do it now. You can confirm that Sentry is working properly and sending data to your Sentry project by using the example page and route created by the installation wizard:

1. Open the example page `/sentry-example-page` in your browser
2. Click the "Throw Sample Error" button. This triggers two errors:
   - a frontend error
   - an error within the API route

Sentry captures both of these errors for you. Additionally, the button click starts a trace to measure the time it takes for the API request to complete.

Don't forget to explore the example files' code in your project to understand what's happening after your button click.

### View Captured Data in Sentry

Now, head over to your project on [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io) to view the collected data (it takes a couple of moments for the data to appear).

## Next Steps

At this point, you should have integrated Sentry into your SvelteKit application and should already be sending error and performance data to your Sentry project.

Now's a good time to customize your setup and look into more advanced topics.
Our next recommended steps for you are:

- Learn how to [manually capture errors](/platforms/javascript/guides/sveltekit/usage/)
- Continue to [customize your configuration](/platforms/javascript/guides/sveltekit/configuration/)
- Learn how to [manually instrument](/platforms/javascript/guides/sveltekit/apis#load-function-instrumentation) SvelteKit-specific features
- Learn more about [deploying SvelteKit apps to Cloudflare Pages](/platforms/javascript/guides/cloudflare/frameworks/sveltekit/)
- Get familiar with [Sentry's product features](/product) like tracing, insights, and alerts
