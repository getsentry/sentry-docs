Sentry's SvelteKit SDK enables automatic reporting of errors and performance data.

## Compatibility

The minimum supported SvelteKit version is `2.0.0`.
This SDK works best with **Vite 4.2** and newer. Older Vite versions might not generate source maps correctly.

<Alert>

  The SvelteKit SDK is designed to work out of the box with the following SvelteKit adapters:

  - [Adapter-auto](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-auto) - for Vercel; other platforms might work but we don't guarantee compatibility at this time.
  - [Adapter-vercel](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-vercel) - only for Node (Lambda) runtimes, not yet Vercel's edge runtime.
  - [Adapter-cloudflare](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-cloudflare) - supported but requires [additional Setup](/platforms/javascript/guides/cloudflare/frameworks/sveltekit/).
  - [Adapter-node](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-node).

  Other adapters may work but aren't currently supported.
  We're looking into extending first-class support to [more adapters](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) in the future.

  The SvelteKit SDK does not yet work with all non-node server runtimes, such as Vercel's edge runtime.

## Install

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your applicationâ€™s runtime.

We recommend installing the SDK by running our installation wizard in the root directory of your project:

```bash
npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i sveltekit
```

The wizard will prompt you to log in to Sentry. It will then automatically do the following steps for you:

- create or update SvelteKit files with the default Sentry configuration:
  - `hooks.(client|server).js` to initialize the SDK and instrument [SvelteKit's hooks](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/hooks)
  - `vite.config.js` to add source maps upload and auto-instrumentation via Vite plugins.
- create a `.sentryclirc` file with an auth token to upload source maps (this file is automatically added to `.gitignore`)
- add an example page to your app to verify your Sentry setup

After the wizard setup is completed, the SDK will automatically capture unhandled errors, and monitor performance.
You can also <PlatformLink to="/usage/">manually capture errors</PlatformLink>.

<Alert>

  If the setup through the wizard doesn't work for you, you can also <PlatformLink to="/manual-setup/">set up the SDK manually</PlatformLink>.

</Alert>

## Configure

Configuration should happen as early as possible in your application's lifecycle.

To complete your configuration, add <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/">options</PlatformLink> to your `Sentry.init()` calls.
Here you can also set context data - data about the <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/identify-user/">user</PlatformLink>, for example, or <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/tags/">tags</PlatformLink>, or even <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/context/">arbitrary data</PlatformLink> - which will be added to every event sent to Sentry.


## Verify

This snippet includes an intentional error, so you can test that everything is working as soon as you set it up.

Add a button to a frontend component that throws an error:

```javascript {filename:src/routes/sentry/+page.svelte} {3}
<button
  on:click={() => {
    throw new Error("Sentry Frontend Error");
  }}
>
  Throw error
</button>
```

Or throw an error in one of your `load` functions:

```javascript {filename:src/routes/sentry/+page.js} {2}
export const load = () => {
  throw new Error("Sentry Load Error");
};
```

Or throw an error in an API route:

```javascript {filename:src/routes/sentry/+server.js} {2}
export const GET = () => {
  throw new Error("Sentry API Error");
};
```

The possibilities are endless!

<Alert>

  Errors triggered from within Browser DevTools are sandboxed and will not trigger error monitoring. Keep this in mind when verifying your Sentry SDK installation.

To view and resolve the recorded error, log into [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and select your project. Clicking on the error's title will open a page where you can see detailed information and mark it as resolved.
