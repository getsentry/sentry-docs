With [tracing](/product/performance/), Sentry tracks your software performance, measuring metrics like throughput and latency, and displaying the impact of errors across multiple systems. Sentry captures distributed traces consisting of transactions and spans, which measure individual services and individual operations within those services. Learn more about our model in [Distributed Tracing](/product/sentry-basics/tracing/distributed-tracing/).

<Note>

If you’re adopting Tracing in a high-throughput environment, we recommend testing prior to deployment to ensure that your service’s performance characteristics maintain expectations.

## Configure

First, enable tracing and configure the sample rate for transactions. Set the sample rate for your transactions by either:

- Setting a uniform sample rate for all transactions using the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> option in your SDK config to a number between `0` and `1`. (For example, to send 20% of transactions, set <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> to `0.2`.)
- Controlling the sample rate based on the transaction itself and the context in which it's captured, by providing a function to the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> config option.

The two options are meant to be mutually exclusive. If you set both, <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> will take precedence.

```csharp {diff}
+ // Add this to the SDK initialization callback
+ // Example uniform sample rate: capture 100% of transactions
+ options.TracesSampleRate = 1.0;
```

## Middleware

Sentry's ASP.NET Core integration includes middleware to automatically capture each incoming HTTP request and turn it into a transaction.

Ordinarily this middleware gets added automatically immediately after ASP.NET Core's `EndpointRoutingMiddleware`. However, if you using `WebApplicationBuilder` and calling `UseRouting` explicitly then you will need to manually add the Sentry tracing middleware by calling `UseSentryTracing` immediately after `UseRouting`.

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.WebHost.UseSentry(o =>
{
    o.Dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    o.TracesSampleRate = 1.0;
    // Add any other configuration options
});
var app = builder.Build();
app.UseRouting();
app.UseSentryTracing();
// Add any other Middleware
app.Run();
```

</PlatformSection>

## Verify

Test out tracing by starting and finishing a transaction, which you _must_ do so transactions can be sent to Sentry. Learn how in our <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation/">Custom Instrumentation</PlatformLink> content.

While you're testing, set <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> to `1.0`, as that ensures that every transaction will be sent to Sentry. Once testing is complete, you may want to set a lower <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> value, or switch to using <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> to selectively sample and filter your transactions, based on contextual data.
