You can configure your [OpenTelemetry SDK](https://opentelemetry.io/) to send traces and spans to Sentry.

## Install

## Usage

## OpenTelemetry and Sentry

With Sentryâ€™s OpenTelemetry SDK, an OpenTelemetry `Span` becomes a Sentry `Transaction` or `Span`. The first `Span` sent through the Sentry `SpanProcessor` is a `Transaction`, and any child `Span` gets attached to the first `Transaction` upon checking the parent `Span` context. This is true for the OpenTelemetry root `Span` and any top level `Span` in the system. For example, a request sent from frontend to backend will create an OpenTelemetry root `Span` with a corresponding Sentry `Transaction`. The backend request will create a new Sentry `Transaction` for the OpenTelemetry `Span`. The Sentry `Transaction` and `Span` are linked as a trace for navigation and error tracking purposes.

### Capturing exceptions

OpenTelemetry in .NET is implemented via the System.Diagnostics.Activity namespace. However, not all of the functionality in that namespace is supported by OpenTelemetry. In particular, it is [not recommended](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/pull/4333) that you use the `Activity.RecordException` or `Activity.AddException` methods. Using either of these methods will result in valuable **information being removed from exceptions** before these get captured by Sentry.

Instead you should either log the exceptions (using `ILogger`) or capture the exceptions directly using `SentrySdk.CaptureException`.

## Additional Configuration

If you need more fine grained control over Sentry, take a look at the <PlatformLink to="/configuration/">Configuration page</PlatformLink>. In case you'd like to filter out transactions before sending them to Sentry (to get rid of health checks, for example), you may find the <PlatformLink to="/configuration/filtering/#filtering-transaction-events">Filtering page</PlatformLink> helpful.
