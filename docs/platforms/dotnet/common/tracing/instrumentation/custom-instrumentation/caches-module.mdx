A cache can be used to speed up data retrieval, thereby improving application performance. Because instead of getting data from a potentially slow data layer, your application will be getting data from memory (in a best case scenario). Caching can speed up read-heavy workloads for applications like Q&A portals, gaming, media sharing, and social networking.

Sentry offers a [cache-monitoring dashboard](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/insights/caches/) for getting an overview of your application's caches.

To make it possible for Sentry to give you an overview of your cache performance, you'll need to create two spans - one indicating that something is being put into the cache, and a second one indicating that something is being fetched from the cache.

Make sure that there's a transaction running when you create the spans. If you're using a web framework like ASP.NET Core those transactions will be created for you automatically. See <PlatformLink to='/tracing/'>Performance Monitoring</PlatformLink> for more information.

For detailed information about which data can be set, see the [Cache Module Developer Specification](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/performance/modules/caches/).

## Manual Instrumentation

Follow the steps below to make sure your Cache related spans end up in Sentry correctly.

### Add Span When Putting Data Into the Cache

1. Set the cache value with whatever cache library you happen to be using.
2. Wrap the part of your application that uses the cached value with  `Sentry.with_child_span { |span| ... }`
3. Set `op` to `cache.put`.
4. Set `cache.item_size` to an integer representing the size of the cached item.

### Add Span When Retrieving Data From the Cache

1. Fetch the cached value from whatever cache library you happen to be using.
2. Wrap the part of your application that uses the cached value with  `Sentry.with_child_span { |span| ... }`
3. Set `op` to `cache.get`.
4. Set `cache.hit` to a boolean value representing whether the value was successfully fetched from the cache or not.
5. Set `cache.item_size` to an integer representing the size of the cached item.

### Example

Consider the following example service using `IMemoryCache` allowing you to `SetInCache` and `GetFromCache`.

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory;

public class MyCachingService
{
    private readonly IMemoryCache _cache;

    public MyCachingService(IMemoryCache cache)
    {
        _cache = cache;
    }

    public void SetInCache(string cacheKey, object value)
    {
        var cacheSpan = SentrySdk.GetSpan()?.StartChild("cache.put");

        // Describe the cache server you are accessing
        cacheSpan?.SetExtra("network.peer.address", "cache.example.com/supercache");
        cacheSpan?.SetExtra("network.peer.port", 9000);

        // Set the key you're going to use to add to the cache
        cacheSpan?.SetExtra("cache.key", cacheKey);

        // Optional: You can also provide the cached item's size
        // cacheSpan?.SetExtra("cache.item_size", /* item size in bytes */);

        // Add an item to your cache
        _cache.Set(cacheKey, value);

        cacheSpan?.Finish();
    }

    public object? GetFromCache(string cacheKey)
    {
        var cacheSpan = SentrySdk.GetSpan()?.StartChild("cache.get");

        // Describe the cache server you are accessing
        cacheSpan?.SetExtra("network.peer.address", "cache.example.com/supercache");
        cacheSpan?.SetExtra("network.peer.port", 9000);

        // Set the key you're going to use to retrieve from the cache
        cacheSpan?.SetExtra("cache.key", cacheKey);

        // Attempt to retrieve the cached item
        if (_cache.TryGetValue(cacheKey, out var cachedValue))
        {
            // If you retrieved a value, the cache was hit
            cacheSpan?.SetExtra("cache.hit", true);

            // Optional: You can also provide the cached item's size
            // cacheSpan.SetExtra("cache.item_size", /* item size in bytes */);

            cacheSpan?.Finish();

            return cachedValue;
        }

        // If you could not retrieve a value, it was a miss
        cacheSpan?.SetExtra("cache.hit", false);
        cacheSpan?.Finish();
        return null;
    }
}
```

You should now have the right spans in place. Head over to the [Cache dashboard](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/performance/caches/) to see how your cache is performing.
