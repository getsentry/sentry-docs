The .NET SDK provides an integration with [Hangfire](https://www.hangfire.io/) to monitor your jobs by automatically [creating check-ins for them](https://docs.sentry.io/product/crons/job-monitoring/). The SDK relies on job filters that are set up when you call `UseSentry`. For example:

```csharp
using Hangfire;
using Sentry.Hangfire;

GlobalConfiguration.Configuration.UseSentry();
```

Alternatively, if you're using the builder pattern, your code may look like this:

```csharp
using Hangfire;
using Sentry.Hangfire;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Services.AddHangfire(configuration => configuration
    .UseSentry() // <- Add Sentry to automatically send check-ins
);
```

To let the SDK know which jobs to monitor, you need to provide the job with a monitor slug. This can be done by setting the `SentryMonitorSlug` attribute on the job. For example, the following snippet shows how to set up a fire-and-forget job that Sentry will monitor:

```csharp
using Hangfire;
using Sentry.Hangfire;

GlobalConfiguration.Configuration.UseSentry();
BackgroundJob.Enqueue<PricingUpdateWorker>(job => job.Execute());

public class PricingUpdateWorker
{
    [SentryMonitorSlug("update-pricing")]
    public void Execute()
    {
        // Do your work to update the price
    }
}
```

The SDK will automatically capture a check-in with `CheckInStatus.InProgress` when the job starts and update the check-in with `CheckInStatus.OK` on success. In case of an exception during execution, the check-in will be updated as `CheckInStatus.ERROR` instead.
