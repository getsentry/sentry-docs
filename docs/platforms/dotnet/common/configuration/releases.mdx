A release is a version of your code that is deployed to an <PlatformLink to="/configuration/environments/">environment</PlatformLink>. When you give Sentry information about your releases, you can:

- Determine issues and regressions introduced in a new release
- Predict which commit caused an issue and who is likely responsible
- Resolve issues by including the issue number in your commit message
- Receive email notifications when your code gets deployed

<Include name="bind-release-version.mdx" />

## Setting a Release

<PlatformContent includePath="set-release" notateUnsupported />

How you make the release name (or version) available to your code is up to you. For example, you could use an environment variable that is set during the build process or during initial start-up.

Setting the release name tags each event with that release name. We recommend that you tell Sentry about a new release before sending events with that release name, as this will unlock a few more features. Learn more in our [Releases](/product/releases/) documentation.

If you don't tell Sentry about a new release, Sentry will automatically create a release entity in the system the first time it sees an event with that release ID.

After configuring your SDK, you can install a repository integration or manually supply Sentry with your own commit metadata. Read our documentation about [setting up releases](/product/releases/setup/) for further information about integrations, associating commits, and telling Sentry when deploying releases.

## Release Health

Monitor the [health of releases](/product/releases/health/) by observing user adoption, usage of the application, percentage of [crashes](/product/releases/health/#crashes), and [session data](/product/releases/health/#sessions). Release health will provide insight into the impact of crashes and bugs as it relates to user experience, and reveal trends with each new issue through the [Release Details](/product/releases/release-details/) graphs and filters.

In order to monitor release health, the SDK sends session data.

### Sessions

A session represents the interaction between the user and the application. Sessions contain a timestamp, a status (if the session was OK or if it crashed), and are always linked to a release. Most Sentry SDKs can manage sessions automatically.

<Alert>

Release health support for .NET is currently limited to single-instance **client** applications only. This means it can be used with WPF, Xamarin, WinForms and similar app models.
Support for server frameworks such as ASP.NET is planned.
