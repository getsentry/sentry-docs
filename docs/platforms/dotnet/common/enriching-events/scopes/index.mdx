When an event is captured and sent to Sentry, SDKs will merge that event data with extra
information from the current scope. SDKs will typically automatically manage the scopes
for you in the framework integrations and you don't need to think about them. However,
you should know what a scope is and how you can use it for your advantage.

## What's a Scope, What's a Hub

You can think of the hub as the central point that our SDKs use to route an
event to Sentry. When you call `init()` a hub is created and a client and a
blank scope are created on it. That hub is then associated with the current
thread and will internally hold a stack of scopes.

The scope will hold useful information that should be sent along with the
event. For instance [contexts](../context/) or
[breadcrumbs](../breadcrumbs/) are stored on
the scope. When a scope is pushed, it inherits all data from the parent scope
and when it pops all modifications are reverted.

The default SDK integrations will push and pop scopes intelligently. For
instance web framework integrations will create and destroy scopes around your
routes or controllers.

## How the Scope and Hub Work

As you start using an SDK, a scope and hub are automatically created for you out
of the box. It's unlikely that you'll interact with the hub directly unless you're
writing an integration or you want to create or destroy scopes. Scopes, on the
other hand are more user facing. You can call <PlatformIdentifier name="configure-scope" /> at any point in
time to modify data stored on the scope. This is useful for doing things like
[modifying the context](../context/).

<Alert>

If you are very curious about how thread locality works for scope data, in .NET there
are two modes for managing "ambient data". Usuaully Sentry will automatically choose the
most appropriate mode for your application type. However this can be overridden by
setting [`SentryOptions.IsGlobalModeEnabled`](../../configuration/options/#is-global-mode-enabled) manually.

If global mode is disabled (appropriate for most server based applications), the
ambient scope data is stored as an `AsyncLocal` and so it will flow with the execution
context. Stephen Toub's blog post on [ExecutionContext vs SynchronizationContext](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/pfxteam/executioncontext-vs-synchronizationcontext/)
explains that concept in more detail.

If global mode is enabled (appropriate for desktop applications), ambient scope data is
stored as a Singleton and available globally. This means you can set context (such as
the user logged into the application) once and it will be sent with all events, regardless
of whether the event was captured on the UI thread or a background thread.

</Alert>

When you call a global function such as <PlatformIdentifier name="capture-event" /> internally Sentry
discovers the current hub and asks it to capture an event. Internally the hub will
then merge the event with the topmost scope's data.

## Configuring the Scope

The most useful operation when working with scopes is the <PlatformIdentifier name="configure-scope" /> function. It can be used to reconfigure the current scope.

You can, for instance, add custom tags or inform Sentry about the currently authenticated user.

<PlatformContent includePath="enriching-events/scopes/configure-scope" />

You can also apply this configuration when unsetting a user at logout:

<PlatformContent includePath="enriching-events/unset-user" />

To learn what useful information can be associated with scopes see
[the context documentation](../context/).

## Local Scopes

We also support pushing and configuring a scope within a single call. This is typically
called <PlatformIdentifier name="with-scope" />, <PlatformIdentifier name="push-scope" /> or implemented as a function parameter on the capture methods, depending on the SDK. It's very helpful if
you only want to send data for one specific event.

### Using Scope Callback Parameter

In the following example we use the scope callback parameter that is available for all `capture` methods to attach a `level` and a `tag` to only one specific error:

<PlatformContent includePath="enriching-events/scopes/scope-callback-param" />

Before the callback is invoked the SDK creates a clone of the current scope, and the changes
made will stay isolated within the callback function. This allows you to
more easily isolate pieces of context information to specific locations in your code or
even call `clear` to briefly remove all context information.

<Alert level="info" title="Important">

Any exceptions that occur within the callback function for configuring a local scope will not be
caught, and all errors that occur will be silently ignored and **not** reported.
