title: Event Processors
description: "Learn how event processors can enrich events globally or in the current scope."

Event processors can enrich events with additional, either globally or within a particular scope. Though event processors are similar to <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send" /> and <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send-transaction" />, there are two key differences:

1. <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send" /> and <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send-transaction" /> are
  guaranteed to be run after all other processing, just before an event gets sent. Event processors run in an undetermined order, so changes to the event may still be made after the event processor runs.
2. <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send" /> and <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send-transaction" /> always run globally. Processors can be configured to run either globally or only within a particular scope.

## Duplicate Event Detection

By default, Sentry includes a global processor that detects and drops duplicate events.

This processor be configured by via `SentryOptions.DeduplicateMode` when initialising the Sentry SDK. This is a flag enum consisting of the following values:
- `DeduplicateMode.SameEvent`: Same event instance. Assumes no object reuse/pooling.
- `DeduplicateMode.SameExceptionInstance`: An exception that was captured twice.
- `DeduplicateMode.InnerException`: An exception already captured exists as an inner exception.
- `DeduplicateMode.AggregateException`: An exception already captured is part of the aggregate exception.
- `DeduplicateMode.All`: All modes combined.

The default value for `SentryOptions.DeduplicateMode` is `DeduplicateMode.All ^ DeduplicateMode.InnerException` (so all detected duplicate events will be dropped except those from inner exceptions). However, if we only wanted `SameEvent` and `SameExceptionInstance` events to be dropped, we could initialize the SDK as follows:

```csharp
SentrySdk.Init(options => {
  // ... configure other options here
  options.DeduplicateMode = DeduplicateMode.SameEvent | DeduplicateMode.SameExceptionInstance;
})
```
Alternatively, duplicate event detection can be disabled entirely by calling `DisableDuplicateEventDetection`:

```csharp
SentrySdk.Init(options => {
  // ... configure other options here
  options.DisableDuplicateEventDetection();
})
```
