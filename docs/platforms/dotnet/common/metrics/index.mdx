<Note>

Metrics for .NET are supported with Sentry .NET SDK version `4.0.0` and above.

</Note>

Sentry metrics help you pinpoint and solve issues that impact user experience and app performance by measuring the data points that are important to you. You can track things like processing time, event size, user signups, and conversion rates, then correlate them back to tracing data in order to get deeper insights and solve issues faster.

# Custom metrics

## Initialization

To enable metrics you have to opt-in the metrics feature.

```csharp
SentrySdk.Init(options =>
{
    options.dsn = "___DSN___";
    // Enable Sentry Metrics,
    options.EnableMetrics(metrics =>
    {
        // Send code locations with any metrics you emit manually
        metrics.EnableCodeLocations = true;
    });
});
```

## Emit a Counter

Counters are one of the more basic types of metrics and can be used to count certain event occurrences.

To emit a counter, do the following:

```csharp
// Incrementing a counter by one for each button click.
SentrySdk.Metrics.Increment("ButtonClicked",
    tags: new Dictionary<string, string> {{ "region", "us-west-1" }});
```

## Emit a Distribution

Distributions help you get the most insights from your data by allowing you to obtain aggregations such as `p90`, `min`, `max`, and `avg`.

To emit a distribution, do the following:

```csharp
// Adding '15' to a distribution used to track the loading time.
SentrySdk.Metrics.Distribution("LoadingTime",
    15,
    unit: MeasurementUnit.Duration.Millisecond,
    tags: new Dictionary<string, string> {{ "region", "us-west-1" }});
```

## Emit a Set

Sets are useful for looking at unique occurrences and counting the unique elements you added.

To emit a set, do the following:

```csharp
// Adding a set of unique occurrences.
SentrySdk.Metrics.Set("UserView", "Rufus",
    unit: MeasurementUnit.Custom("username"),
    tags: new Dictionary<string, string> {{ "region", "us-west-1" }});
```

## Emit a Gauge

Gauges let you obtain aggregates like `min`, `max`, `avg`, `sum`, and `count`. They can be represented in a more space-efficient way than distributions, but they can't be used to get percentiles. If percentiles aren't important to you, we recommend using gauges.

To emit a gauge, do the following:

```csharp
// Adding '15' to a gauge used to track the loading time.
SentrySdk.Metrics.Gauge("LoadingTime",
    15,
    unit: MeasurementUnit.Duration.Millisecond,
    tags: new Dictionary<string, string> {{ "region", "us-west-1" }});
```

## Emit a Timer

Timers can be used to measure the execution time of a specific block of code. They're implemented like distributions, but measured in seconds.

To emit a timer, do the following:

```csharp
// Measure the time of execution within the using block
using (SentrySdk.Metrics.StartTimer("bingo"))
{
    // Your code goes here
}
```

# OpenTelemetry Metrics

You can configure the .NET SDK to automatically capture and send OpenTelemetry metrics to Sentry.

For example, you can configure Sentry to capture all the built-in metrics that it knows about:

```csharp {13}
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
builder.Services.AddOpenTelemetry()
    .WithMetrics(metrics => metrics
            .AddRuntimeInstrumentation() // <-- Requires the OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Runtime package
            .AddMeter(
                "Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting",
                "Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel",
                "System.Net.Http")
    );

builder.WebHost.UseSentry(options =>
{
    options.dsn = "___DSN___";
    options.EnableMetrics(metrics => metrics.CaptureSystemDiagnosticsMeters = BuiltInSystemDiagnosticsMeters.All);
});
```

You can also capture only metrics from specific Meters:

```csharp {5-6}
builder.WebHost.UseSentry(options =>
{
    options.dsn = "___DSN___";
    metrics.CaptureSystemDiagnosticsMeters = [
        BuiltInSystemDiagnosticsMeters.MicrosoftAspNetCoreHosting,
        BuiltInSystemDiagnosticsMeters.SystemNetHttp,
    ];
});
```

Or, you can choose to capture only metrics from specific Instruments:

```csharp {11}
var HatsMeter = new Meter("HatCo.HatStore", "1.0.0");
var HatsSold = HatsMeter.CreateCounter<int>(
    name: "hats-sold",
    unit: "Hats",
    description: "Number of hats sold"
);

SentrySdk.Init(options => {
    options.dsn = "___DSN___";
    options.EnableMetrics(metrics => {
        metrics.CaptureSystemDiagnosticsInstruments = ["hats-sold"];
    });
});
```
