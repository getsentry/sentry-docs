The Sentry SDK for .NET supports capturing exceptions thrown from `async void` methods. This is particularly useful for capturing exceptions when you need to run asynchronous code from UI event handlers.

## Basic Example

The following example uses `RunAsyncVoid` in a button click event handler:

```csharp
    private void OnFetchContentClicked(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        var client = new HttpClient();

        // This example passes an exception handler callback to RunAsyncVoid, which logs a warning if an exception occurs
        SentrySdk.RunAsyncVoid(
            async () => await client.GetAsync("https://amostunreliablewebsite.net/"),
            ex => _logger.LogWarning(ex, "Error fetching data")
        );

        // This is an example of the same, omitting the exception handler callback. In this case, the default exception
        // handler will be used, which simply captures any exceptions and sends these to Sentry
        SentrySdk.RunAsyncVoid(async () => await client.GetAsync("https://amostunreliablewebsite.net/"));
    }
```
