Upgrading includes both breaking changes and new features.

## Migrating to 4.x

### .NET Target Framework Changes

We're dropping support for some of the old target frameworks. See this [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/discussions/2776) for details on why.

- Support for .NET Framework 4.6.1 has been replaced with 4.6.2 because 4.6.1 went out of support in 2022.
- Support for .NET Core 3.1 and .NET 5 has been dropped.
- Support for netstandard2.0 for Sentry.AspNetCore has been dropped.
- Support for .NET 6 on mobile (e.g: `net6.0-android`) has been replaced with .NET 7 .
<br/>Due to changes in .NET 8, it's no longer possible to maintain support for .NET 6 mobile-specific targets. As a result, we are transitioning mobile-specific TFMs from `net6.0-platform` to `net7.0-platform`. This means that mobile apps built on .NET 6 will now utilize the `Sentry` .NET 6 package, which provides .NET-only features without native/platform-specific bindings and SDKs. For more information, please refer to [this ticket](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/issues/2623).

- Support for MAUI Tizen has been dropped

### Sentry Self-Hosted Compatibility

If you're using `sentry.io` this change does not affect you.
This SDK version is compatible with a self-hosted version of Sentry `22.12.0` or higher. If you are using an older version of [self-hosted Sentry](https://develop.sentry.dev/self-hosted/) (aka on-premise), you will need to [upgrade](https://develop.sentry.dev/self-hosted/releases/). 

### Significant Changes in Behavior

- Transaction names for ASP.NET Core are now consistently named `HTTP-VERB /path` (e.g. `GET /home`). Previously, the leading forward slash was missing for some endpoints.
- Setting `SentryOptions.Dsn` to `null` now throws `ArgumentNullException` during initialization.
- `CaptureFailedRequests` is now enabled by default.
- When `ImplicitUsings` is enabled, the `Sentry` namespace is automatically added to global usings. If you have conflicts, you can opt out by adding the following to your `csproj`:
    ```
    <PropertyGroup>
      <SentryImplicitUsings>false</SentryImplicitUsings>
    </PropertyGroup>
    ```
- Transactions' spans are no longer automatically finished with the status `deadline_exceeded` by the transaction. This is now handled by [Relay](https://github.com/getsentry/relay). 
  - Customers self hosting Sentry must use version `22.12.0` or later
- The `User.IpAddress` is now set to `{{auto}}` by default, even when `sendDefaultPII` is disabled.
  - To prevent sending IP addresses, use the "Prevent Storing of IP Addresses" option in the "Security & Privacy" project settings on sentry.io.
- The `DiagnosticLogger` signature for `LogWarning` now takes `exception` as the first parameter. This way, it no longer gets mixed up with `TArgs`.

### Breaking Changes

#### Changed APIs

- Class renamed from `Sentry.User` to `Sentry.SentryUser`.
- Class renamed from `Sentry.Runtime` to `Sentry.SentryRuntime`.
- Class renamed from `Sentry.Span` to `Sentry.SentrySpan`.
- Class renamed from `Sentry.Transaction` to `Sentry.SentryTransaction`.
- Class renamed from `Sentry.Constants` to `Sentry.SentryConstants`.
- Class renamed from `Sentry.Context` to `Sentry.SentryContext`.
- Class renamed from `Sentry.Package` to `Sentry.SentryPackage`.
- Class renamed from `Sentry.Request` to `Sentry.SentryRequest`.
- Class renamed from `Sentry.` to `Sentry.SentryTransaction`.
- Class renamed from `Sentry.Session` to `Sentry.SentrySession`.
- Class renamed from `Sentry.Attachment` to `Sentry.SentryAttachment`.
- Class renamed from `Sentry.Hint` to `Sentry.SentryHint`.
- Interface renamed from `Sentry.ISession` to `Sentry.SentryISession`.
- Interface renamed from `Sentry.IJsonSerializable` to `Sentry.SentryIJsonSerializable`.
- Interface renamed from `Sentry.ITransaction` to `Sentry.ITransactionTracer`.
- iOS and MacCatalyst platform-specific options renamed from `Cocoa` to `Native`.
- iOS and MacCatalyst platform-specific options from `iOS` to `Cocoa`.
- iOS platform-specific options renamed from `EnableCocoaSdkTracing` to `EnableTracing`.
- Android platform-specific options renamed from `Android` to `Native`.
- Android platform-specific options renamed from `EnableAndroidSdkTracing` and `EnableAndroidSdkBeforeSend` to `EnableTracing` and `EnableBeforeSend` respectively.
- `DebugImage` and `DebugMeta` moved to `Sentry.Protocol` namespace.
- `SentryClient.Dispose` is no longer obsolete.
- `ISentryClient.CaptureEvent` overloads have been replaced by a single method accepting optional `Hint` and `Scope` parameters. You will need to pass `hint` as a named parameter from code that calls `CaptureEvent` without passing a `scope` argument.
- `TransactionContext` and `SpanContext` constructors were updated and unified. If you're constructing instances of these classes, you will need to adjust the order in which you pass parameters to these.
    ```csharp
    public TransactionContext(
        string name,
        string operation,
        SpanId? spanId = null,
        SpanId? parentSpanId = null,
        SentryId? traceId = null,
        string? description = "",
        SpanStatus? status = null,
        bool? isSampled = null,
        bool? isParentSampled = null,
        TransactionNameSource nameSource = TransactionNameSource.Custom
    )
    ```
- The `DiagnosticLogger` signature for `LogError` and `LogFatal` now takes the `exception` as the first parameter. This way, it no longer gets mixed up with the `TArgs`. The `DiagnosticLogger` now also receives an overload for `LogError` and `LogFatal` that accepts a message only.
- `Distribution` added to `IEventLike`.
- `StackFrame`'s `ImageAddress`, `InstructionAddress`, and `FunctionId` changed to `long?`.
- `DebugImage.ImageAddress` changed to `long?`.
- Contexts now inherit from `IDictionary` rather than `ConcurrentDictionary`. The specific dictionary being used is an implementation detail.
- The method used to configure a Sentry Sink for Serilog now has an additional overload. Calling `WriteTo.Sentry()` with no arguments will no longer attempt to initialize the SDK (it has optional arguments to configure the behavior of the Sink only). If you want to initialize Sentry at the same time you configure the Sentry Sink, then you will need to use the overload of this method that accepts a DSN as the first parameter (for example, `WriteTo.Sentry("https://d4d82fc1c2c4032a83f3a29aa3a3aff@fake-sentry.io:65535/2147483647")`).

#### Removed APIs

- `SentrySinkExtensions.ConfigureSentrySerilogOptions` is now internal only. If you were using this method, please use one of the `SentrySinkExtensions.Sentry` extension methods instead.
- A number of `[Obsolete]` options have been removed:
  - `BeforeSend` - use `SetBeforeSend` instead.
  - `BeforeSendTransaction` - use `SetBeforeSendTransaction` instead.
  - `BeforeBreadcrumb` - use `SetBeforeBreadcrumb` instead.
  - `CreateHttpClientHandler` - use `CreateHttpMessageHandler` instead.
  - `ReportAssemblies` - use `ReportAssembliesMode` instead.
  - `KeepAggregateException` - this property is no longer used and has no replacement.
  - `DisableTaskUnobservedTaskExceptionCapture`- use `DisableUnobservedTaskExceptionCapture` instead.
  - `DebugDiagnosticLogger` - use `TraceDiagnosticLogger` instead.
- A number of iOS/Android-specific `[Obsolete]` options have been removed:
  - `Distribution` - use `SentryOptions.Distribution` instead.
  - `EnableAutoPerformanceTracking` - use `SetBeforeSendTransaction` instead.
  - `EnableCoreDataTracking` - use `EnableCoreDataTracing` instead.
  - `EnableFileIOTracking` - use `EnableFileIOTracing` instead.
  - `EnableOutOfMemoryTracking` - use `EnableWatchdogTerminationTracking` instead.
  - `EnableUIViewControllerTracking` - use `EnableUIViewControllerTracing` instead.
  - `StitchAsyncCode` - no longer available.
  - `ProfilingTracesInterval` - no longer available.
  - `ProfilingEnabled` - use `ProfilesSampleRate` instead.
- A number of obsolete types have been removed:
  - `SystemClock` - use `SystemClock.Clock` instead.
  - `Scope.GetSpan()` - use `Span` property instead.
  - `IUserFactory` - use `ISentryUserFactory` instead.
  - `SentryException.Data` - use `SentryException.Mechanism.Data` instead.
  - `Runtime.Clone()` - this shouldn't have been public in the past and has no replacement.
  - `AssemblyExtensions` - this shouldn't have been public in the past and has no replacement.
  - `SentryDatabaseLogging.UseBreadcrumbs()` - it is called automatically and has no replacement.
- A number of interfaces have removed:  
  - `IHasMeasurements` - use `ISpanData` instead.
  - `IHasBreadcrumbs` - use `IEventLike` instead.
  - `ISpanContext` - use `ITraceContext` instead.
  - `IHasTransactionNameSource` - use `ITransactionContext` instead.
- The unused `StackFrame.InstructionOffset` has been removed.
- The unused `Scope.Platform` property has been removed.
- The obsolete setter `Sentry.PlatformAbstractions.Runtime.Identifier` has been removed.
- `Sentry.Values<T>` is now internal as it is never exposed in the public API.
- The `TracePropagationTarget` class has been removed. Use the `SubstringOrRegexPattern` class instead.
- The `WithScope` and `WithScopeAsync` methods have been removed. We have discovered that these methods didn't work correctly in certain desktop contexts, especially when using a global scope.
<br/>Replace your usage of `WithScope` with overloads of `Capture*` methods:
  - `SentrySdk.CaptureEvent(SentryEvent @event, Action<Scope> scopeCallback)`
  - `SentrySdk.CaptureMessage(string message, Action<Scope> scopeCallback)`
  - `SentrySdk.CaptureException(Exception exception, Action<Scope> scopeCallback)`

  ```c#
  // Before
  SentrySdk.WithScope(scope =>
  {
    scope.SetTag("key", "value");
    SentrySdk.CaptureEvent(new SentryEvent());
  });

  // After
  SentrySdk.CaptureEvent(new SentryEvent(), scope =>
  {
    // Configure your scope here
    scope.SetTag("key", "value");
  });
  ```

## Migrating to 3.12.0

### NuGet Changes

If you're using the `Sentry.EntityFramework` NuGet package, you must update to at least version 6.2 of the `EntityFramework` NuGet package.

## Migrating from 2.x to 3.x

### Breaking Changes

Please read through **all** breaking changes prior to upgrading.

#### Grouping Changes

The format of the stack traces were greatly improved with the help of Ben Adam's iconic library `Ben.Demystifier`. Frames now include details such as `async`, `static`, the actual return type, method parameters, tuples and their names, and more.

However, this will **affect grouping**. If you prefer to stay with the original stack trace format, you can opt-out of this feature with:

```
options.StackTraceMode = StackTraceMode.Original;
```

#### Serialization

In version 3.0.0, the Sentry SDK for .NET changed from `Newtonsoft.Json` to `System.Text.Json`.
Using the new library has many advantages. These include the lack of an additional dependency (when targeting .NET Core 3, .NET 5, and later versions) and much faster performance.

One breaking change that affects objects set as [Context](../enriching-events/context/) and `Extra` is that `Newtonsoft.Json` was previously able to serialize some types, which is not possible with `System.Text.Json`.

Setting an instance of `Exception` that was caught in a `catch` block could fail to serialize, and the event would be dropped by Sentry. This won't break your app, but the error wouldn't make it into Sentry:

```
 ---> System.NotSupportedException: Serialization and deserialization of 'System.Type' instances are not supported and should be avoided since they can lead to security issues.
   at System.Text.Json.Serialization.Converters.TypeConverter.Write(Utf8JsonWriter writer, Type value, JsonSerializerOptions options)
   at System.Text.Json.Serialization.JsonConverter`1.TryWrite(Utf8JsonWriter writer, T& value, JsonSerializerOptions options, WriteStack& state)
   at System.Text.Json.JsonPropertyInfo`1.GetMemberAndWriteJson(Object obj, WriteStack& state, Utf8JsonWriter writer)
   at System.Text.Json.Serialization.Converters.ObjectDefaultConverter`1.OnTryWrite(Utf8JsonWriter writer, T value, JsonSerializerOptions options, WriteStack& state)
   at System.Text.Json.Serialization.JsonConverter`1.TryWrite(Utf8JsonWriter writer, T& value, JsonSerializerOptions options, WriteStack& state)
   at System.Text.Json.JsonPropertyInfo`1.GetMemberAndWriteJson(Object obj, WriteStack& state, Utf8JsonWriter writer)
   at System.Text.Json.Serialization.Converters.ObjectDefaultConverter`1.OnTryWrite(Utf8JsonWriter writer, T value, JsonSerializerOptions options, WriteStack& state)
   at System.Text.Json.Serialization.JsonConverter`1.TryWrite(Utf8JsonWriter writer, T& value, JsonSerializerOptions options, WriteStack& state)
   at System.Text.Json.Serialization.JsonConverter`1.WriteCore(Utf8JsonWriter writer, T& value, JsonSerializerOptions options, WriteStack& state)
```

To avoid this issue, pass a serializable object into Sentry. For example, map the instance of `Exception` to an anonymous object:

```
try
{
    throw new ArgumentNullException("test");
}
catch (Exception e)
{
    SentrySdk.ConfigureScope(s =>
    {
        s.Contexts["Exception"] = new
        {
            e.Message,
            e.StackTrace,
            e.Data
        };
    });
    SentrySdk.CaptureMessage("Exception in contexts");
}
```

### Namespace Change

Classes under `Sentry.Protocol` were moved to the root namespace `Sentry`. All except `Context` classes like `App`, `Device`, etc.

### ASP.NET

ASP.NET (**not Core**) users need to install an additional package, `Sentry.AspNet`. Without this package, HTTP related information will not be added to events.

You can plug the package into the `Init` as follows:

```
options.AddAspNet();
```

The motivation was to remove the reference to `System.Web` and decouple the core of the package from any specific namespaces of the .NET Framework. This change improves the experience from other environments, such as game engines like Unity and [Godot](https://gatomalo.dev/blog/2020/03/21/error-monitoring-godot-sentry/#android).

### ASP.NET Core

#### Environment Casing

To match Sentry's default environment naming convention, unless explicitly set otherwise, the Sentry environment will be reported in lowercase. That means if `ASPNET_ENVIRONMENT` is equal to `Production`, the Sentry SDK will report it as `production`.

#### Removal of `IncludeRequestPayload`

The option `IncludeRequestPayload` that was deprecated in the Sentry SDK 2.0 has been removed.
The replacement is the option `MaxRequestBodySize`.

#### New Methods on `IHub` and `ISentryClient`

Sentry's performance monitoring capabilities requires additive API changes to interfaces such as `IHub` and `ISentryClient`. If you implement your own `IHub`, you'll need to implement two new methods:

`ISentryClient` received: `CaptureTransaction`.
`IHub` received: `StartTransaction` and `GetTraceHeader`.

#### Rename of `DiagnosticsLogger` to `DiagnosticLogger`

To align with other SDKs, the option is now named: `DiagnosticLogger`
[Docs PR](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-docs/pull/2945).

#### `Dsn` as a String

`SentryOptions` now take a string for `Dsn`:

Before: `o.Dsn = new Dsn("..");`
After: `o.Dsn = "..";`

#### `LogEntry` Became `Message`

The property of `SentryEvent` that supports a structured log entry was renamed to `Message` to align with the protocol and other SDKs.

### Self-Hosted Support

This version uses the [envelope endpoint](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/envelopes/). If you are using an on-premise installation it requires Sentry version >= v20.6.0 to work. If you are using sentry.io nothing will change and no action is needed.

### New Features and Improvements

#### Offline Caching

You can optionally have events cached to disk. To do so, specify which directory the SDK can use to write crash files:

`options.CacheDirectoryPath = Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.LocalApplicationData))`

#### Attachments

You can add attachments to events. Please refer to our [Attachments documentation](../enriching-events/attachments/).

#### User Feedback

You can add user feedback to events via a .NET API. Please refer to the [User Feedback documentation](../user-feedback/).

#### ASP.NET Core gRPC support

A new package was added ASP.NET Core gPRC support, adding the ability to log the request payload in case of errors.

#### Release Notes

Please refer to [GitHub for the complete release notes](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/releases/tag/3.0.0).

### Breaking Changes

Upgrading from SharpRaven to Sentry SDK includes the following breaking changes.

#### .NET Framework Support Reduced

If your project is targeting .NET Framework, it will need to be using at least v4.6.1 to use Sentry (SharpRaven supported .NET Framework v3.5 and higher).

#### Initialization

Changed how to initialize Sentry:

<SignInNote />

```csharp
using Sentry;

// Initialize with DSN
SentrySdk.Init("___PUBLIC_DSN___");

// Initialize with options
SentrySdk.Init(o =>
{
    o.Dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___";
});
```

For ASP.NET (classic) integration, add `Sentry.AspNet` package and initialize it by calling `o.AddAspNet()`:

<SignInNote />

```csharp
using Sentry;
using Sentry.AspNet;

SentrySdk.Init(o =>
{
    o.Dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___";

    o.AddAspNet();
});
```

#### Event Queue

Contrary to SharpRaven, events in Sentry SDK are sent in background without blocking the currently executing code. Calling `SentrySdk.CaptureException(...)` does not immediately send an event, but instead queues it up on a background thread.

Usage changes:

```csharp
// Before
ravenClient.Capture(...);
await ravenClient.CaptureAsync(...);

// After
SentrySdk.CaptureEvent(...);
```

If you need to stop the execution until events captured are sent to Sentry, you can also flush the queue:

```csharp
SentrySdk.CaptureException(...);
// Only proceed once exception is captured. Waiting up to 2 seconds for it.
await SentrySdk.FlushAsync(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2));
```

You can close the SDK, which will also flush the event queue, by invoking the `IDisposable` returned by `SentrySdk.Init(...)`:

<SignInNote />

```csharp
var sentryInitialization = SentrySdk.Init("___PUBLIC_DSN___");

// Capture a non-error message
SentrySdk.CaptureMessage("hello world");

// Tear down Sentry and flush queued up events
sentryInitialization.Dispose();
```

#### Event Processors

Usage changes:

```csharp
// Before
ravenClient.BeforeSend = requester =>
{
    // Here you can log data from the requester
    // or replace it entirely if you want.
    return requester;
};

// After
SentrySdk.Init(o =>
{
    o.BeforeSend = e =>
    {
        // Mutate the event or return null to drop it altogether
        return e;
    };
}
});
```

#### Providing User Information

SharpRaven used `IUserFactory` interface for extracting user information. In Sentry SDK you can instead provide user information directly:

```csharp
SentrySdk.ConfigureScope(scope =>
{
    scope.User = new User
    {
        Id = "42",
        Email = "john.doe@example.com"
    };
})
```

For ASP.NET Core applications, this is done automatically. User information is extracted from the context of the currently executing request.
