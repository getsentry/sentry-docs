<GuideGrid platform="dotnet" />

This <PlatformLink to="/compatibility/">SDK is compatible</PlatformLink> with the latest .NET and .NET Core platforms, as well as .NET Standard 2.0 and .NET Framework 4.6.1 or newer. You can use it with applications written in C#, VB.NET, F#, and other .NET programming languages. For older versions, such as .NET Framework 3.5, you may continue to use our <Link rel={`nofollow`} to={`/platforms/dotnet/legacy-sdk/`}>legacy SDK</Link>, until further notice.

## Install

<OnboardingOptionButtons options={['error-monitoring', 'performance', 'profiling']}/>

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your applicationâ€™s runtime. These are platform-specific and allow Sentry to have a deep understanding of how your application works.

Install the **NuGet** package to add the Sentry dependency:

<OnboardingOption optionId="profiling" hideForThisOption>
  ```shell {tabTitle:.NET Core CLI}
  dotnet add package Sentry -v {{@inject packages.version('sentry.dotnet') }}
  ```

  ```powershell {tabTitle:Package Manager}
  Install-Package Sentry -Version {{@inject packages.version('sentry.dotnet') }}
  ```

  ```shell {tabTitle:Paket CLI}
  paket add Sentry --version {{@inject packages.version('sentry.dotnet') }}
```
</OnboardingOption>

<OnboardingOption optionId="profiling">

  <Note>

  Sentry profiling for .NET is available in Alpha on .NET 6.0+ (tested on .NET 7.0 & .NET 8.0 as well).

  </Note>

  ```shell {tabTitle:.NET Core CLI}
  dotnet add package Sentry.Profiling -v {{@inject packages.version('sentry.dotnet.profiling') }}
  ```

  ```powershell {tabTitle:Package Manager}
  Install-Package Sentry.Profiling -Version {{@inject packages.version('sentry.dotnet.profiling') }}
  ```

  ```shell {tabTitle:Paket CLI}
  paket add Sentry.Profiling --version {{@inject packages.version('sentry.dotnet.profiling') }}
    ```
</OnboardingOption>

## Configure

To capture all errors, even the one during the startup of your application, you should initialize the Sentry .NET SDK as soon as possible.

<SignInNote />

```csharp {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "6-7", "profiling": "8-9"}}
SentrySdk.Init(options =>
{
    options.Dsn = "https://eb18e953812b41c3aeb042e666fd3b5c@o447951.ingest.us.sentry.io/5428537";
    options.Debug = true;
    options.AutoSessionTracking = true;
    // A fixed sample rate of 1.0 - 100% of all transactions are getting sent
    options.TracesSampleRate = 1.0f;
    // A sample rate for profiling - this is relative to TracesSampleRate
    options.ProfilesSampleRate = 1.0f;
});
```

## Verify

The SDK will capture unhandled exceptions that are simply thrown or you can handle the error by calling `CaptureException` explicitely.

```csharp
using Sentry;

try
{
    throw null;
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    SentrySdk.CaptureException(ex);
}
```
