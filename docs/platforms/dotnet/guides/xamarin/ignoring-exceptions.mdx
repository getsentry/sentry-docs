You can ignore exceptions by their type when initializing the SDK:

```csharp
// Add this to the SDK initialization callback
options.AddExceptionFilterForType<OperationCanceledException>();
```

```fsharp
// Add this to the SDK initialization callback
options.AddExceptionFilterForType<OperationCanceledException>()
```

It works in the whole inheritance chain.
The example above will also filter out `TaskCanceledException` because it derives from `OperationCanceledException`.
