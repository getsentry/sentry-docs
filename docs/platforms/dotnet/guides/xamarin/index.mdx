Sentry's .NET SDK works with Xamarin applications through the [Sentry Xamarin NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sentry.Xamarin) and Xamarin Forms with the [Sentry Xamarin Forms NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sentry.Xamarin.Forms).

The SDK is compatible with the following versions or higher:

- Xamarin.Android 9.0
- Xamarin.iOS 10.14
- Universal Windows Platform 10.0.16299
- Tizen 4.0

## Install

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-install" />

## Configure

After you’ve completed setting up a project in Sentry, Sentry will give you a value which we call a DSN or Data Source Name. It looks a lot like a standard URL, but it’s just a representation of the configuration required by the Sentry SDKs. It consists of a few pieces, including the protocol, public key, the server address, and the project identifier.

<OnboardingOptionButtons options={['error-monitoring', 'performance']}/>

You should initialize the SDK as early as possible, for an example, the start of OnCreate
on MainActivity for Android, and, the top of FinishedLaunching on AppDelegate for iOS).

```csharp
SentryXamarin.Init(options =>
{
    options.AddXamarinFormsIntegration();
    // Tells which project in Sentry to send events to:
    options.Dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    // When configuring for the first time, to see what the SDK is doing:
    options.Debug = true;
    // Adds request URL and headers, IP and name for users, etc.
    options.SendDefaultPii = true;
    // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ performance
    // Set TracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    // of transactions for tracing.
    // We recommend adjusting this value in production
    options.TracesSampleRate = 1.0;
    // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ performance
});
// App code

```

## Verify

Great! Now that you’ve completed setting up the SDK, maybe you want to quickly test out how Sentry works. Start by capturing an exception:

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-verify" />

All you need to do is to [initialize the SDK with `SentryXamarin.Init`](../../), you will not need any additional changes to get the SDK ready to go.

The SDK automatically handles `AppDomain.UnhandledException` and `Application.UnhandledException`, so you'll not need to worry about trying to Catch Unhandled Exceptions.

### Xamarin Options

The following options are only going to be valid during the SDK initialization.

#### DisableNativeIntegration

Disable the native event processor for Android,iOS,UWP

#### DisableOfflineCaching

By calling it, the SDK will not automatically Cache your events and they might be lost if a hard crash happens or no connectivity is available during the transport of the event.

#### AttachScreenshots

Automatically attaches a screenshot of the app at the time of the event capture. By default, it is set to false.

<Alert level="warning" title="Note">

Note that personally identifiable information (PII) might be included in the screenshot when you activate this feature.

</Alert>

### Xamarin Forms Options

#### DisableXamarinWarningsBreadcrumbs

Disables the automatic Logging of internal Warnings that comes from Xamarin Forms.
