Sentry provides an integration with Blazor WebAssembly through the [Sentry.AspNetCore.Blazor.WebAssembly NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sentry.AspNetCore.Blazor.WebAssembly).

<Note>

The Blazor WebAssembly package is currently in alpha preview. Alpha features are still in progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.

</Note>


## Install

Add the Sentry dependency to your Blazor WebAssembly application:

```shell {tabTitle:.NET Core CLI}
dotnet add package Sentry.AspNetCore.Blazor.WebAssembly -v {{@inject packages.version('sentry.dotnet.aspnetcore.blazor.webassembly') }}
```

```powershell {tabTitle:Package Manager}
Install-Package Sentry.AspNetCore.Blazor.WebAssembly -Version {{@inject packages.version('sentry.dotnet.aspnetcore.blazor.webassembly') }}
```

This package extends [Sentry.Extensions.Logging](/platforms/dotnet/guides/extensions-logging/). This means that in addition to the related Blazor WebAssembly features, you'll also get access to the `ILogger<T>` integration and other features available in the main [Sentry](/platforms/dotnet/) SDK through this package.

## Configure

Sentry integration with Blazor WebAssembly is done by calling `.UseSentry()` and specifying the options, for example:

<SignInNote />


```csharp
var builder = WebAssemblyHostBuilder.CreateDefault(args);
builder.UseSentry(options =>
{
        options.Dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___";
        options.EnableTracing = true;
        // When configuring for the first time, to see what the SDK is doing:
        // options.Debug = true;


});

// Captures logError and higher as events
builder.Logging.AddSentry(o => o.InitializeSdk = false);

await builder.Build().RunAsync();
```

## Samples

- This [integration with Blazor WebAssembly](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/tree/main/samples/Sentry.Samples.AspNetCore.Blazor.Wasm) sample demonstrates using Sentry with Blazor WebAssembly. (**C#**)
