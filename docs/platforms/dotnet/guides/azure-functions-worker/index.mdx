Sentry provides an integration with Azure Functions through the [Sentry.Azure.Functions.Worker NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sentry.Azure.Functions.Worker).
All triggers are supported.

## Features

In addition to capturing errors, you can monitor interactions between multiple services or applications by [enabling tracing](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/).

Select which Sentry features you'd like to install in addition to Error Monitoring to get the corresponding installation and configuration instructions below.

## Install

<OnboardingOptionButtons options={['error-monitoring', 'performance']}/>

Add the Sentry dependency to your Azure Functions application:

```shell {tabTitle:.NET Core CLI}
dotnet add package Sentry.Azure.Functions.Worker -v {{@inject packages.version('sentry.dotnet.azure.functions.worker') }}
```

```powershell {tabTitle:Package Manager}
Install-Package Sentry.Azure.Functions.Worker -Version {{@inject packages.version('sentry.dotnet.azure.functions.worker') }}
```

This package extends [Sentry.Extensions.Logging](/platforms/dotnet/guides/extensions-logging/). This means that besides the Azure Functions related features, through this package you'll also get access to the `ILogger<T>` integration and also the features available in the main [Sentry](/platforms/dotnet/) SDK.

## Configure

Sentry integration with Azure Functions is done by calling `.UseSentry()` and specifying the options, for example:

<SignInNote />

<Note>

If using the ASP.NET Core integration add `UseSentry` to the `ConfigureFunctionsWebApplication` call instead.

</Note>

```csharp {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "11-13"}}
using Sentry.Azure.Functions.Worker;

var host = new HostBuilder()
    .ConfigureFunctionsWorkerDefaults((host, builder) =>
    {
        builder.UseSentry(host, options =>
        {
            options.Dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___";
            // When configuring for the first time, to see what the SDK is doing:
            options.Debug = true;
            // Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100% of transactions for performance monitoring.
            // We recommend adjusting this value in production.
            options.TracesSampleRate = 1.0;
        });
    })
    .Build();
await host.RunAsync();
```

## Verify

This snippet includes an intentional error, so you can test that everything is working as soon as you set it up.
