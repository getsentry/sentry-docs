Sentry provides an integration with Azure Functions through the [Sentry.Extensions.Logging](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sentry.Extensions.Logging) and [Sentry.OpenTelemetry](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sentry.OpenTelemetry) NuGet packages.

## Features

In addition to capturing errors, you can monitor interactions between multiple services or applications by [enabling tracing](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/).

Select which Sentry features you'd like to install in addition to Error Monitoring to get the corresponding installation and configuration instructions below.

## Install

<OnboardingOptionButtons options={['error-monitoring', 'performance']}/>

Add the Sentry dependencies to your Azure Functions application:

```shell {tabTitle:.NET Core CLI}
dotnet add package Sentry.Extensions.Logging -v {{@inject packages.version('sentry.extensions.logging') }}
dotnet add package Sentry.OpenTelemetry -v {{@inject packages.version('sentry.opentelemetry') }}
```

```powershell {tabTitle:Package Manager}
Install-Package Sentry.Extensions.Logging -Version {{@inject packages.version('sentry.extensions.logging') }}
Install-Package Sentry.OpenTelemetry -Version {{@inject packages.version('sentry.opentelemetry') }}
```

The [Sentry.Extensions.Logging](/platforms/dotnet/guides/extensions-logging/) package also provides access to the `ILogger<T>` integration and the other core features available in the [Sentry](/platforms/dotnet/) SDK.

## Configure

The core features of Sentry are enabled by calling `AddSentry` when configuring logging.

Performance tracing can be enabled by adding Sentry to the OpenTelemetry `TraceProviderBuilder` and then configuring Sentry itself to use OpenTelemetry.

For example:

```csharp
using Sentry.OpenTelemetry;

using var tracerProvider = Sdk.CreateTracerProviderBuilder()
    .AddSentry() // <-- Configure OpenTelemetry to send traces to Sentry
    .AddAspNetCoreInstrumentation() // From OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore... adds automatic tracing for incoming requests
    .AddHttpClientInstrumentation() // From OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http... adds automatic tracing for outgoing HTTP requests
    .Build();

var host = new HostBuilder()
    .ConfigureFunctionsWorkerDefaults()
    .ConfigureLogging(logging =>
    {
        logging.AddSentry(options =>
        {
            options.Dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___";
            options.TracesSampleRate = 1.0;
            options.UseOpenTelemetry(); // <-- Configure Sentry to use open telemetry
            options.DisableSentryHttpMessageHandler = true; // So Sentry doesn't also create spans for outbound HTTP requests
            options.Debug = true;
        });
    })
    .Build();


await host.RunAsync();
```

## Verify

This snippet includes an intentional error, so you can test that everything is working as soon as you set it up.
