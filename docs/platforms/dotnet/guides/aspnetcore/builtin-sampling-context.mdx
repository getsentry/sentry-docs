You can sample transactions by providing a delegate that makes a decision based on the provided context. Sentry's ASP.NET Core integration automatically exposes useful data as part of that context.

For example, here's how to sample a transaction based on the requested path:

```csharp
// Add this to the SDK initialization callback
options.TracesSampler = context =>
{
    var requestPath = context.TryGetHttpPath();

    // We're interested in the checkout page more than others
    if (string.Equals(requestPath, "/checkout", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
    {
        return 0.8; // Sample 80% of checkout transactions
    }

    // Sample only 5% of the everything else
    return 0.05;
};
```

Besides `context.TryGetHttpPath()`, you can also use `context.TryGetHttpRoute()` to get the route name (if available) and `context.TryGetHttpMethod()` to get the HTTP method used to execute the request.

Note that all these methods may return `null`. This can happen either if the corresponding property is not available, or if tracing has not been enabled.
