<Note>

Capturing transactions requires that you first <PlatformLink to="/tracing/">set up tracing</PlatformLink> if you haven't already. You'll also need to enable the <PlatformLink to="/">base Sentry integration for ASP.NET Core</PlatformLink>.

</Note>

### Server Integration

Sentry's ASP.NET Core integration includes middleware to automatically capture each incoming HTTP request and turn it into a transaction.

Transaction names follow the pattern `<HTTP method> <Route>`; for example, a request to the following action will create a transaction named `GET /person/{id}`:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

public class HomeController : Controller
{
    [HttpGet("/person/{id}")]
    public IActionResult Person(string id) { /* ... */ }
}
```

Transactions created by this integration are automatically added to the current scope. If you want to start your own spans from the automatically created transaction, you can use the following approach:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

public class HomeController : Controller
{
    private readonly IHub _sentryHub;

    public HomeController(IHub sentryHub) => _sentryHub = sentryHub;

    [HttpGet("/person/{id}")]
    public IActionResult Person(string id)
    {
        var childSpan = _sentryHub.GetSpan()?.StartChild("additional-work");
        try
        {
            // Do the work that gets measured.

            childSpan?.Finish(SpanStatus.Ok);
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            childSpan?.Finish(SpanStatus.InternalError);
            throw;
        }
    }
}
```

### HTTP Client Integration

Sentry also provides a custom filter for HTTP client factory commonly used in ASP.NET Core applications. This filter adds an additional message handler that automatically injects Sentry's trace header and tracks outgoing HTTP requests in separate spans attached to the current transaction.

To enable this integration, you need to have HTTP client factory enabled within your application:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;

public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        /* ... */

        services.AddRouting();

        // This is required for HTTP client integration
        services.AddHttpClient();
    }
}
```

If you already have `AddHttpClient()` in your service collection (which is likely the case), then no action is required.
