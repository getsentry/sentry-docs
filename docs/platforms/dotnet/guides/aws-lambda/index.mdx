Sentry provides an integration with AWS Lambda ASP.NET Core Server through the [Sentry.AspNetCore NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sentry.AspNetCore).

## Features

In addition to capturing errors, you can monitor interactions between multiple services or applications by [enabling tracing](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/).

Select which Sentry features you'd like to install in addition to Error Monitoring to get the corresponding installation and configuration instructions below.

## Install

<OnboardingOptionButtons options={['error-monitoring', 'performance']}/>

Add the Sentry dependency:

```powershell {tabTitle:Package Manager}
Install-Package Sentry.AspNetCore -Version {{@inject packages.version('sentry.dotnet.aspnetcore') }}
```

```shell {tabTitle:.NET Core CLI}
dotnet add package Sentry.AspNetCore -v {{@inject packages.version('sentry.dotnet.aspnetcore') }}
```

You can combine this integration with a logging library like `log4net`, `NLog`, or `Serilog` to include both request data as well as your logs as breadcrumbs. The logging ingrations also capture events when an error is logged.

## Configure

All `ASP.NET Core` configurations are valid here. But one configuration in particular is relevant.

`FlushOnCompletedRequest` ensures all events are flushed out. This is because the general ASP.NET Core hooks for when the process is exiting are not guaranteed to run in a serverless environment. This setting ensures that no event is lost if AWS recycles the process.

```csharp {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "12-14"}}
public class LambdaEntryPoint : Amazon.Lambda.AspNetCoreServer.APIGatewayProxyFunction
{
    protected override void Init(IWebHostBuilder builder)
    {
        builder
            // Add Sentry
            .UseSentry(options =>
            {
                options.Dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___";
                // When configuring for the first time, to see what the SDK is doing:
                o.Debug = true;
                // Set TracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
                // of transactions for tracing.
                // We recommend adjusting this value in production
                o.TracesSampleRate = 1.0;
                // Required in Serverless environments
                options.FlushOnCompletedRequest = true;
            })
            .UseStartup<Startup>();
    }
}
```
