Sentry provides an integration with AWS Lambda ASP.NET Core Server through the [Sentry.AspNetCore NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sentry.AspNetCore).

## Install

Add the Sentry dependency:

```powershell {tabTitle:Package Manager}
Install-Package Sentry.AspNetCore -Version {{@inject packages.version('sentry.dotnet.aspnetcore') }}
```

```shell {tabTitle:.NET Core CLI}
dotnet add package Sentry.AspNetCore -v {{@inject packages.version('sentry.dotnet.aspnetcore') }}
```

You can combine this integration with a logging library like `log4net`, `NLog`, or `Serilog` to include both request data as well as your logs as breadcrumbs. The logging ingrations also capture events when an error is logged.

### Configuring

All `ASP.NET Core` configurations are valid here. But one configuration in particular is relevant.

`FlushOnCompletedRequest` ensures all events are flushed out. This is because the general ASP.NET Core hooks for when the process is exiting are not guaranteed to run in a serverless environment. This setting ensures that no event is lost if AWS recycles the process.

            .UseSentry(options =>
            {
                options.Dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___";
                // When configuring for the first time, to see what the SDK is doing:
                options.Debug = true;
                // Set TracesSampleRate to 0.1 to capture 10%
                // of transactions for performance monitoring.
                options.TracesSampleRate = 0.1;
                // Required in Serverless environments
                options.FlushOnCompletedRequest = true;
            })
            .UseStartup<Startup>();
    }
}
```
