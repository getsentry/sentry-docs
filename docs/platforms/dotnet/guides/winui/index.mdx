Sentry's .NET SDK works with Windows UI Library applications through the [Sentry NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sentry).

## Features

In addition to capturing errors, you can monitor interactions between multiple services or applications by [enabling tracing](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/).

Select which Sentry features you'd like to install in addition to Error Monitoring to get the corresponding installation and configuration instructions below.

## Install

<OnboardingOptionButtons options={['error-monitoring', 'performance']}/>

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-install" />

## Configure (Without Trimming)

If you don't have [Trimming](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/trimming/trimming-options?pivots=dotnet-8-0) enabled when publishing your application then all you need to do is [initialize the SDK with `SentrySdk.Init`](/platforms/dotnet/) in the constructor of your application class (usually `App.xaml.cs`). Sentry's integration for WinUI will automatically capture any unhandled exceptions in your application and send these to Sentry.

<Alert>

Do not initialize the SDK in the `OnLaunched` event of the application or the `Hub` will not be initialized correctly.

```csharp {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "17-20"}}
using Sentry.Protocol;

sealed partial class App : Application
{
    public App()
    {
        // Initialize Sentry in the App constructor before any other code, to ensure you capture all possible exceptions.
        SentrySdk.Init(options =>
        {
            // Tells which project in Sentry to send events to:
            options.Dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___";

            // When configuring for the first time, to see what the SDK is doing:
            options.Debug = true;

            // Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100% of transactions for tracing.
            // We recommend adjusting this value in production.
            options.TracesSampleRate = 1.0;

            // Enable Global Mode since this is a client app.
            options.IsGlobalModeEnabled = true;

            // TODO:Any other Sentry options you need go here.
        });

        // Initialize the app component, and hook the Suspending event.
        this.InitializeComponent();

        // Add any other code you may need last.
    }
}
```

## Configure (With Trimming)

If you have [Trimming](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/trimming/trimming-options?pivots=dotnet-8-0) enabled when publishing your application then, in addition to [initializing the SDK with `SentrySdk.Init`](/platforms/dotnet/), you must also configure an UnhandledException handler in the constructor of your application class (usually `App.xaml.cs`).

<Alert>

Do not initialize the SDK in the `OnLaunched` event of the application or the `Hub` will not be initialized correctly.

```csharp
// Add these to your existing using statements.
using Sentry.Protocol;
using UnhandledExceptionEventArgs = Microsoft.UI.Xaml.UnhandledExceptionEventArgs;

sealed partial class App : Application
{
    public App()
    {
        // Initialize Sentry in the App constructor before any other code, to ensure you capture all possible exceptions.
        SentrySdk.Init(o =>
        {
            // Tells which project in Sentry to send events to:
            o.Dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___";

            // When configuring for the first time, to see what the SDK is doing:
            o.Debug = true;

            // Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100% of transactions for tracing.
            // We recommend adjusting this value in production.
            o.TracesSampleRate = 1.0;

            // Enable Global Mode since this is a client app.
            o.IsGlobalModeEnabled = true;

            // Disable Sentry's built in UnhandledException handler as this won't work with AOT compilation
            o.DisableWinUiUnhandledExceptionIntegration();

            // TODO:Any other Sentry options you need go here.
        });

        // Hook up the WinUI UnhandledException event before initializing the app component.
        this.UnhandledException += OnUnhandledException;

        // Initialize the app component, and hook the Suspending event.
        this.InitializeComponent();

        // Add any other code you may need last.
    }

    // Add this OnUnhandledException handler.

    // Use this attribute to ensure all types of exceptions are handled.
    [SecurityCritical]
    private void OnUnhandledException(object sender, UnhandledExceptionEventArgs e)
    {
        // Get a reference to the exception, because the Exception property is cleared when accessed.
        var exception = e.Exception;
        if (exception != null)
        {
            // Tell Sentry this was an unhandled exception
            exception.Data[Mechanism.HandledKey] = false;
            exception.Data[Mechanism.MechanismKey] = "Application.UnhandledException";

            // Capture the exception
            SentrySdk.CaptureException(exception);

            // Flush the event immediately
            SentrySdk.FlushAsync(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2)).GetAwaiter().GetResult();
        }
    }
}
```
