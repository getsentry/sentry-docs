Sentry supports [.NET for iOS, macOS, and Mac Catalyst](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/ios/) directly from the [Sentry NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sentry).

## Overview of the features

- All the features of our main [.NET SDK](/platforms/dotnet), for your managed code
- Native crash reporting for Apple platforms, leveraging our [Cocoa SDK](/platforms/apple) including:
    - Automatically [attach screenshots to Native exceptions](/platforms/apple/guides/ios/configuration/options/#attach-screenshot)
    - Detect [App Hangs](/platforms/apple/configuration/app-hangs/)
    - [Automatic performance tracing](/platforms/apple/performance/)
    - [Automatic breadcrumbs](/platforms/apple/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/#automatic-breadcrumbs)
    - [Swizzling](/platforms/apple/configuration/swizzling/)
- Automatic session tracking and [release health](/product/releases/)

## Install

Add the Sentry dependency to your .NET for iOS, macOS, and/or Mac Catalyst application:

```shell {tabTitle:.NET Core CLI}
dotnet add package Sentry -v {{@inject packages.version('sentry.dotnet') }}
```

```powershell {tabTitle:Package Manager}
Install-Package Sentry -Version {{@inject packages.version('sentry.dotnet') }}
```

## Configure

In your `AppDelegate.cs` file, call `SentrySdk.Init` in the `FinishedLaunching` event and include any options you would like to set. The `Dsn` is the only required parameter.


```csharp
[Register("AppDelegate")]
public class AppDelegate : UIApplicationDelegate
{
    public override bool FinishedLaunching(UIApplication application, NSDictionary launchOptions)
    {
        // Init the Sentry SDK
        SentrySdk.Init(options =>
        {
            options.Dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___";
            options.SendDefaultPii = true; // adds the user's IP address automatically
#if DEBUG
            // Log debug information about the Sentry SDK
            options.Debug = true;
#endif

            // All the native iOS SDK options are available below
            // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/apple/guides/ios/configuration/
            // Enable Native iOS SDK App Hangs detection
            options.Native.EnableAppHangTracking = true;

            options.SetBeforeSend(evt =>
            {
                if (evt.Exception?.Message.Contains("Something you don't care want logged?") ?? false)
                {
                    return null; // return null to filter out event
                }
                // or add additional data
                evt.SetTag("dotnet-iOS-Native-Before", "Hello World");
                return evt;
            });

            options.OnCrashedLastRun = e =>
            {
                Console.WriteLine(e);
            };
        });
    }
}
```

### Options

The .NET for iOS, macOS, and Mac Catalyst integration is part of [Sentry](/platforms/dotnet/). Please refer to the documentation for that package for information about platform agnostic options.

## Verify

This snippet includes an intentional error, so you can test that everything is working as soon as you set it up.
