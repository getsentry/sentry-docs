Sentry provides an integration with ASP.NET through the [Sentry.AspNet NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sentry.AspNet).

## Features

In addition to capturing errors, you can monitor interactions between multiple services or applications by [enabling tracing](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/).

Select which Sentry features you'd like to install in addition to Error Monitoring to get the corresponding installation and configuration instructions below.

## Install

<OnboardingOptionButtons options={['error-monitoring', 'performance']}/>

Add the Sentry dependency:

```powershell {tabTitle:Package Manager}
Install-Package Sentry.AspNet -Version {{@inject packages.version('sentry.dotnet.aspnet') }}
```

```shell {tabTitle:.NET Core CLI}
dotnet add package Sentry.AspNet  -v {{@inject packages.version('sentry.dotnet.aspnet') }}
```

You can combine this integration with a logging library like `log4net`, `NLog` or `Serilog` to include both request data
as well as your logs as breadcrumbs. The logging integrations also capture events when an error is logged.

## Configure

You configure the SDK in the `Global.asax.cs`:


```csharp {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "21-24, 34-43"}}
using System;
using System.Web;
using Sentry.AspNet;
using Sentry.EntityFramework; // If you also installed Sentry.EntityFramework
using Sentry.Extensibility;

public class MvcApplication : HttpApplication
{
    private IDisposable _sentry;

    protected void Application_Start()
    {
        // Initialize Sentry to capture AppDomain unhandled exceptions and more.
        _sentry = SentrySdk.Init(options =>
        {
            options.Dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___";
            // When configuring for the first time, to see what the SDK is doing:
            options.Debug = true;

            // Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100% of transactions for performance monitoring.
            // We recommend adjusting this value in production.
            options.TracesSampleRate = 1.0;

            // If you also installed the Sentry.EntityFramework package
            options.AddEntityFramework();
            options.AddAspNet();
        });
    }

    // Global error catcher
    protected void Application_Error() => Server.CaptureLastError();

    protected void Application_BeginRequest()
    {
        Context.StartSentryTransaction();
    }

    protected void Application_EndRequest()
    {
        Context.FinishSentryTransaction();
    }

    protected void Application_End()
    {
        // Flushes out events before shutting down.
        _sentry?.Dispose();
    }
}
```

### Capturing the affected user

When opting-in to [SendDefaultPii](#senddefaultpii), the SDK will automatically read the user from the request by inspecting `HttpContext.User`. Default claim values like `NameIdentifier` for the _Id_ will be used.


```csharp
options.AddAspNet();
options.Dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___";
// Opt-in to send things like UserId and UserName if a user is logged-in
options.SendDefaultPii = true;
```

### SendDefaultPii

Although this setting is part of the [Sentry](/platforms/dotnet/) package, in the context of ASP.NET Core, it means reporting the user by reading the frameworks `HttpContext.User`. The strategy to create the `SentryUser` can be customized.

### IncludeRequestPayload

It's helpful to troubleshoot a problem in the API when the payload that hit the endpoint is logged.
Opt-in to send the request body to Sentry:

```csharp
options.AddAspNet(RequestSize.Always);
```

## Verify

This snippet includes an intentional error, so you can test that everything is working as soon as you set it up.
