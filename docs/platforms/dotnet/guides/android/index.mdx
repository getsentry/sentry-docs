Sentry supports [.NET for Android](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/android/getting-started/installation/) directly from the [Sentry NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sentry).

## Overview of the features

- All the features of our main [.NET SDK](/platforms/dotnet), for your managed code
- Attach LogCat logs to events
- Java crash reporting for Android, leveraging our [Android SDK](/platforms/android) including:
    - [Capture Application Not Responding (ANR) errors](/platforms/android/configuration/app-not-respond/) when the app is unresponsive
    - Automatically [attach screenshots to Java exceptions](/platforms/android/enriching-events/screenshots/)
    - Automatic breadcrumbs for Activity lifecycle, App lifecycle, System and Network events and User Interactions
    - Automatic [Activity lifecycle tracing](/platforms/android/tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#activity-instrumentation) and [User Interaction tracing](/platforms/android/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#user-interaction-instrumentation)
    - Device Root checking
- Native crash reporting for Android, leveraging our [Android NDK](/platforms/android/configuration/using-ndk/)
- Automatic session tracking and [release health](/product/releases/)
- _Session Replay for Android_ (currently experimental)

## Install

Add the Sentry dependency to your .NET for Android application:

```shell {tabTitle:.NET Core CLI}
dotnet add package Sentry -v {{@inject packages.version('sentry.dotnet') }}
```

```powershell {tabTitle:Package Manager}
Install-Package Sentry -Version {{@inject packages.version('sentry.dotnet') }}
```

## Configure

In your `MainActivity.cs` file, call `SentrySdk.Init` in the `OnCreate` event and include any options you would like to set. The `Dsn` is the only required parameter.


```csharp
[Activity(Label = "@string/app_name", MainLauncher = true)]
public class MainActivity : Activity
{
    protected override void OnCreate(Bundle? savedInstanceState)
    {
        SentrySdk.Init(options =>
        {
            options.Dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___";
            options.SendDefaultPii = true; // adds the user's IP address automatically
#if DEBUG
            // Log debug information about the Sentry SDK
            options.Debug = true;
#endif

            // Android specific .NET features are under the Android properties:
            options.Android.LogCatIntegration = LogCatIntegrationType.Errors; // Get logcat logs for both handled and unhandled errors; default is unhandled only
            options.Android.LogCatMaxLines = 1000; // Defaults to 1000

            // All the native Android SDK options are available below
            // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/android/configuration/
            // Enable Native Android SDK ANR detection
            options.Native.AnrEnabled = true;

            // Session Replay is currently available via the ExperimentalOptions
            options.Native.ExperimentalOptions.SessionReplay.OnErrorSampleRate = 1.0;
            options.Native.ExperimentalOptions.SessionReplay.SessionSampleRate = 1.0;
            options.Native.ExperimentalOptions.SessionReplay.MaskAllImages = false;
            options.Native.ExperimentalOptions.SessionReplay.MaskAllText = false;

            options.SetBeforeSend(evt =>
            {
                if (evt.Exception?.Message.Contains("Something you don't care want logged?") ?? false)
                {
                    return null; // return null to filter out event
                }
                // or add additional data
                evt.SetTag("dotnet-Android-Native-Before", "Hello World");
                return evt;
            });
        });

        base.OnCreate(savedInstanceState);
    }
}
```

### Options

The .NET for Android integration is part of [Sentry](/platforms/dotnet/). Please refer to the documentation for that package for information about platform agnostic options.

Android specific options are described below.

### LogCatIntegration

Can be set to control whether when LogCat logs are attached to events. It can be set to one of the following values:

- `None`: The LogCat integration is disabled.
- `Unhandled`: LogCat logs are attached to events only when the event is unhandled.
- `Errors`: LogCat logs are attached to events with an exception.
- `All`: LogCat logs are attached to all events.

The default is `LogCatIntegrationType.None`

<Alert level="warning">

Use caution when enabling `LogCatIntegrationType.All`, as this may result in a lot of data being sent to Sentry and performance issues if the SDK generates a lot of events.

</Alert>

### LogCatMaxLines

The maximum number of lines to read from LogCat logs.

The default value is 1000.

## Verify

This snippet includes an intentional error, so you can test that everything is working as soon as you set it up.
