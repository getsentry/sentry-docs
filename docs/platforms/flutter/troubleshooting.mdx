If you need help solving issues with Sentry's Flutter SDK, you can read the edge cases documented here. If you need additional help, you can [ask on GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dart/issues/new/choose). Customers on a paid plan may also contact support.

## "Missing API declaration" after App Store review

Starting May 1, 2024, Apple requires all apps submitted to the App Store to provide a list of privacy-related APIs they use, including the reasons under which they use it. If you received an email from Apple with the message "ITMS-91053: Missing API declaration", your app doesn't fulfill the requirements. To solve this, follow our [Apple Privacy Manifest](/platforms/flutter/data-management/apple-privacy-manifest) guide.

## Known Limitations

- If you enable the `split-debug-info` and `obfuscate` features, you must upload [debug symbols](/platforms/flutter/upload-debug/).
- Issue titles might be obfuscated as we rely on the `runtimeType`, but they may not be human-readable. See the [Obfuscate Caveat](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/obfuscate#caveat).
- Layout related errors are only caught by [FlutterError.onError](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/foundation/FlutterError/onError.html) in debug mode. In release mode, they are removed by the Flutter framework. See [Flutter build modes](https://flutter.dev/docs/testing/build-modes).
- Use [inbound filters](/product/data-management-settings/filtering/) to exclude unhandled errors that are caught outside of your application in release builds. The SDK cannot filter these directly due to obfuscated stack traces.
- If your app runs on Windows and uses a Flutter version below `3.3.0`, you need to set the version and build number manually, see [this issue on GitHub](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/73652). To do so:
  - Use Dart defines to build the app: `flutter build windows --dart-define=SENTRY_RELEASE=my_app@1.0.0+1`
  - Or, set the release on SentryOptions `options.release = 'my_app@1.0.0+1'` during SDK initialization.

## Building Specific ABI on Android

The Sentry Flutter SDK includes the Sentry Android SDK, which bundles multiple native libraries for multiple ABIs.
Building a Flutter app for a specific ABI using the `--target-platform` argument, for example an ARM 32bit apk, looks like this, which should also include the `--split-per-abi` flag:

```bash
flutter build apk --target-platform=android-arm --split-per-abi
```

## Native Symbolication on Android

The configuration for symbolication of Native events (C/C++) is documented in our [Android Native Development Kit](/platforms/android/configuration/using-ndk/) content. If you are having issues with symbolication in Flutter, check that your configuration is correct, as discussed in our Flutter content that covers [Uploading for Android NDK](/platforms/flutter/upload-debug/#uploading-for-android-ndk)

## Native Symbolication on iOS/macOS

Flutter `split-debug-info` and `obfuscate` flags are supported on iOS/macOS. They require compiling your app using Flutter, version `3.7.0` and above and the Sentry Flutter SDK, version `6.10.0` and above.

## Source Context

Source Context support requires compiling your app using the `split-debug-info` build parameter on Flutter `3.10.0` and above. You must also upload [debug symbols](/platforms/flutter/upload-debug/) with the `upload_sources` option enabled.

## Sentry Dart Plugin

If you are using the Sentry Dart Plugin to upload [Debug Symbols](/platforms/flutter/upload-debug/#automatically-upload-debug-symbols), refer to the points below to resolve potential issues.

A Sentry `auth_token` can be generated at the [Organization Auth Tokens ](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/settings/auth-tokens/) settings page.

Dart's `--obfuscate` option is required to be paired with `--split-debug-info` to generate a symbol map. See [Dart docs](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Obfuscating-Dart-Code) for more information.

The `--split-debug-info` option requires setting an output directory. The directory must be an inner folder of the project's folder. See [Flutter docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/obfuscate#obfuscate-your-app) for more information.

Flutter's `build web` command requires setting the `--source-maps` parameter to generate source maps. See [Flutter GitHub Issue](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/72150#issuecomment-755541599) for more information.

## Screenshot Integration Background Crash

There is an [issue with the Sentry Flutter SDK](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dart/issues/1669) where apps can crash if taking screenshots in the background.

This is an [issue](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/135245) with Flutter itself and should be fixed in [Flutter 3.15](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/labels/found%20in%20release%3A%203.15).

For prior versions, you can work around this by configuring the SDK only to take screenshots when the app is in the `resumed` state. To do this, set `SentryFlutterOptions.attachScreenshotOnlyWhenResumed` to `true`.
