_(New in version 6.17.0)_

Enabling UI instrumentation captures transactions and adds breadcrumbs for a set of different user interactions, which include clicks, long clicks, taps, and so on.

## Instrumentation Behaviour

Before diving into the configuration, it's important to understand how user interaction instrumentation behaves:

- The instrumentation sets the transaction name specified in the `key` of the `Widget` from the `key` of the `Widget`, for example `login_button`.
- The transaction operation is set to `ui.action.click`.
- If the user interaction transaction has reached the [idleTimeout](/platforms/flutter/configuration/options/#idle-timeout), but didn't have any child spans added, it will be dropped.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure:

1. The Sentry Flutter SDK is initialized. Learn more [here](/platforms/flutter/#configure).
2. Tracing is set up. Learn more [here](/platforms/flutter/tracing/).

## Configure

### 1. Wrap root widget

Wrap your root widget with `SentryWidget`:

```dart
Future<void> main() async {
  await SentryFlutter.init(
    // Configure your options
    (options) => options.dsn = '___DSN___',
    appRunner: () => runApp(SentryWidget(child: MyApp())),
  );
}
```

### 2. Set a unique key for your widgets

If the view doesn't have the key assigned, the transaction and the breadcrumb won't be captured because it can't be uniquely identified.
The key value should be unique across the whole application because the transactions are grouped by its name.

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  key: const Key('my_button_widget'),
  onPressed: () {
    final activeSpan = Sentry.getSpan();
    final childSpan = activeSpan?.startChild('some operation', description: 'some description');
    childSpan?.finish();
  }, child: const Text('User Interaction Example'),
),
```

## Verify

Tap on the button specified in step 2 of the configure section, wait for `idleTimeout` seconds (default is 3s) then check the performance page for a new transaction called `my_button_widget`.

## Handling Successive User Interaction Events

### Default Behaviour

When a new user interaction occurs while a user interaction transaction is still in progress, the SDK automatically completes the ongoing transaction.
This is necessary because only one transaction can be active in the scope at a time.

### Interaction with the Same View

If the same view is interacted with again (e.g. clicking an `ElevatedButton` repeatedly) within the `idleTimeout` period then the SDK does the following:

- Resets the idle timer for the transaction.
- Extends the transactionâ€™s duration by the length of the `idleTimeout`.

## Additional Configuration

### Disabling User Interaction Tracing

User interaction tracing is enabled by default.
If you wish to opt-out of this feature set the `enableUserInteractionTracing` option to `false`.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  await SentryFlutter.init(
    (options) => options.enableUserInteractionTracing = false,
    appRunner: () => runApp(SentryWidget(child: MyApp())),
  );
}
```

### Disabling User Interaction Breadcrumbs

User interaction breadcrumbs are enabled by default.
If you wish to opt-out of this feature set the `enableUserInteractionBreadcrumbs` option to `false`.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  await SentryFlutter.init(
    (options) => options.enableUserInteractionBreadcrumbs = false,
    appRunner: () => runApp(SentryWidget(child: MyApp())),
  );
}
```

### Breadcrumb PII

By default, breadcrumbs exclude widget labels and text to avoid capturing personally identifiable information (PII).
To include these details, set the `sendDefaultPii` option to `true`.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  await SentryFlutter.init(
    (options) => options.sendDefaultPii = true,
  appRunner: () => runApp(SentryWidget(child: MyApp())),
  );
}
```

### Transaction Timeout

The transaction finishes automatically after it reaches the specified [idleTimeout](/platforms/flutter/configuration/options/#idle-timeout) and all of its child spans are finished.
The `idleTimeoout` defaults to `3000` milliseconds (3 seconds).

#### Disable Timeout

You can also disable the idle timeout by setting it to `null`, but if you do, you must finish the transaction manually.

To finish the transaction manually, use `Sentry.getSpan()` to retrieve the active transaction on the scope:

```dart
import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';

// Finish the transaction manually
final activeTransaction = Sentry.getSpan()
await activeTransaction?.finish();
```
