[AssetBundle](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/services/AssetBundle-class.html) instrumentation provides insight into how long your app takes to load its assets, such as files.

## Instrumentation Behaviour

The instrumentation starts a span from an active transaction that's bound to the scope of the following calls:

- `load` and `loadString` - The SDK sets the span `operation` to `file.read`.
- `loadStructuredData` - The SDK sets the span `operation` to `serialize`.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure:

1. The Sentry Flutter SDK is initialized. Learn more [here](/platforms/flutter/#configure).
2. Tracing is set up. Learn more [here](/platforms/flutter/tracing/).

## Configure

Wrap the `runApp` method with a `DefaultAssetBundle` and `SentryAssetBundle`.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  await SentryFlutter.init(
    (options) => options.dsn = '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
      appRunner: () => runApp(
        DefaultAssetBundle(
          bundle: SentryAssetBundle(),
          child: MyApp(),
        ),
    ),
  );
}
```

## Verify

### 1. Execute the Code

```dart
final transaction = Sentry.startTransaction(
  'asset-bundle-transaction',
  'load',
  bindToScope: true,
);

final text = await DefaultAssetBundle.of(context).loadString('assets/lorem-ipsum.txt');

await transaction.finish(status: const SpanStatus.ok());
```

### 2. View the Transaction on Sentry.io

To view the recorded transaction, log into [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and open your project.
Clicking **Performance** will open a page with transactions, where you can select the just recorded transaction with the name `asset-bundle-transaction`.

## Additional Configuration

### Disabling the `loadStructuredData` Feature

The `loadStructuredData` is an opt-out feature. The following example shows how to disable it:

```dart
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

SentryAssetBundle(enableStructuredDataTracing: false)
```
