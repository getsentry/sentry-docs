Sentry's app start instrumentation provides insight into how long your application takes to launch.

<Alert>

App start instrumentation is available on **iOS** and **Android**.

</Alert>

## Instrumentation Behaviour

Before diving into the configuration, it's important to understand how app start instrumentation behaves:

App start instrumentation tracks the duration between the earliest native process initialization and the first frame rendered (as reported by [addTimingsCallback](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/scheduler/SchedulerBinding/addTimingsCallback.html)). Once the app start is processed, the callback is removed to avoid additional overhead.

When the SDK receives the start and end times of the app launch, the SDK:
- Creates a transaction named `ui.load`
- Attaches a span with either `app.start.cold` or `app.start.warm` operation
- Adds app start metrics to the transaction

<Alert>

While the SDK differentiates between cold and warm starts, it doesn't track hot starts/resumes.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure:

1. The Sentry Flutter SDK is initialized. Learn more [here](/platforms/flutter/#configure)
2. Tracing is set up. Learn more [here](/platforms/flutter/tracing/).

## Configure

This instrumentation is automatically enabled. There is no need for further configuration.

## Verify

### 1. Launch Your App:

Launch your Sentry configured app.

### 2. Locate Your Transaction:

Open the [sentry.io performance page](https://sentry.io/performance), find, and select the 'root /' transaction and navigate to the trace view of a sampled event.

### 3. View App Start Metrics:

Select the event within your transaction. Sentry displays the app start metrics on the right side of the screen in the **Mobile Vitals** section.
