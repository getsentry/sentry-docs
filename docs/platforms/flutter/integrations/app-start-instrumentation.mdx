Sentry's app start instrumentation provides insight into how long your application takes to launch.

## Instrumentation Behaviour

Before diving into the configuration, it's important to understand how app start instrumentation behaves:

- The SDK attaches the app start metrics to the **first run transaction**.
- It tracks the length of time from the **earliest native process initialization** until the very first [PostFrameCallback](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/scheduler/SchedulerBinding/addPostFrameCallback.html) is triggered.
- The SDK differentiates between a cold and a warm start, but doesn't track hot starts/resumes.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure:

1. The Sentry Flutter SDK is initialized. Learn more [here](/platforms/flutter/#configure)
2. Tracing is set up. Learn more [here](/platforms/flutter/tracing/).

## Configure

This type of instrumentation is automatically enabled. There is no need for further configuration.

## Verify

### 1. Execute the Transaction:

Initiate a transaction immediately after the app launches.

```dart
import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';

final transaction = Sentry.startTransaction("test test", "my operation");
await Future.delayed(const Duration(milliseconds: 1000));
transaction.finish();
```

### 2. Locate Your Transaction:

Open the [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/) performance dashboard, find, and select the transaction you executed.

### 3. View App Start Metrics:

Select the event within your transaction. Sentry.io displays the app start metrics on the right side of the screen.

## Additional Configuration

### Change App Start Tracking End

1. Set `autoAppStart` to `false` in the Sentry options.
2. Call `SentryFlutter.setAppStartEnd`.

```dart
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

// Run my App and do my things first

// Initialize the Flutter SDK
Future<void> main() async {
  await SentryFlutter.init(
    (options) => options.autoAppStart = false,
  );
}

// End the App Start metric
SentryFlutter.setAppStartEnd(DateTime.now().toUtc());
```
