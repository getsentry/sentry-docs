Unresponsive UI and animation hitches annoy users and degrade the user experience.
This integration can help. Set it up and identify these problems in your app by tracking and showing **slow frames**, **frozen frames**, and **frame delay** metrics for spans.
Learn more about frame delay [here](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/performance/frames-delay/).

## Instrumentation Behaviour

Frame metrics are manually calculated using the [addPersistentFrameCallback](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/scheduler/SchedulerBinding/addPersistentFrameCallback.html) API from the Flutter SDK.
Frame duration tracking in Sentry's Flutter SDK begins automatically when a span starts. It continuously measures each frame's render time until the span finishes, then calculates and attaches frame metrics to the completed span.

## Prerequisite

Before starting, ensure:

1. The Sentry Flutter SDK is initialized. Learn more [here](/platforms/flutter/#configure).
2. Tracing is set up. Learn more [here](/platforms/flutter/tracing/).

## Configure

This type of instrumentation is automatically enabled. There is no need for further configuration.

## Additional Configuration

### Disabling the Instrumentation

Set `enableFramesTracking` to `false` in the options to disable the instrumentation.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  await SentryFlutter.init(
    (options) => options.enableFramesTracking = false,
    appRunner: () => runApp(MyApp()),
  );
}
```
