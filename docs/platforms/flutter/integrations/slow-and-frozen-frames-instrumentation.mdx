Unresponsive UI and animation hitches annoy users and degrade the user experience.
This integration can help. Set it up and identify these problems in your app by tracking and showing **slow frames**, **frozen frames**, and **frame delay** metrics for spans.
Learn more about frame delay [here](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/performance/frames-delay/).

<Alert>

Frames tracking instrumentation is available on **iOS**, **macOS** and **Android**.

## Instrumentation Behaviour

The frames tracking instrumentation measures frame metrics (slow frames, frozen frames, and frame delay) for each span. To calculate these metrics, the SDK uses a custom `WidgetsFlutterBinding` that measures the duration between [handleBeginFrame](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/scheduler/SchedulerBinding/handleBeginFrame.html) and [handleDrawFrame](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/scheduler/SchedulerBinding/handleDrawFrame.html) to determine each frame's render time.

Frame duration tracking begins automatically when a span starts. The integration continuously measures frame durations until the span finishes, then calculates and attaches the frame metrics to the completed span.

## Prerequisite

Before starting, ensure:

1. The Sentry Flutter SDK is initialized. Learn more [here](/platforms/flutter/#configure).
2. Tracing is set up. Learn more [here](/platforms/flutter/tracing/).

## Configure

This instrumentation is automatically enabled through two integrations:
- The `WidgetsFlutterBindingIntegration` which provides the custom binding for frame tracking
- The `FramesTrackingIntegration` which processes and attaches the frame metrics to spans

In most cases, no additional configuration is required.

### Early Widgets Binding Initialization

If you need to initialize the widgets binding earlier than `SentryFlutter.init()`, you must call `SentryWidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` manually. Note that using a different custom binding will prevent this instrumentation from working properly.

Example:
```dart {2}
void main() {
  SentryWidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  // ... rest of your initialization code
}
```

## Additional Configuration

### Disabling the Instrumentation

Set `enableFramesTracking` to `false` in the options to disable the instrumentation.

```dart {3}
await SentryFlutter.init(
  (options) {
    options.enableFramesTracking = false
  },
);
```
