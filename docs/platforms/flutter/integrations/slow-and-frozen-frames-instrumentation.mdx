Unresponsive UI and animation hitches annoy users and degrade the user experience.
Two measurements to track these types of experiences are **slow frames** and **frozen frames**.
Sentry's slow and frozen frames instrumentation helps track these measurements.

## Instrumentation Behaviour

Slow and frozen frames are retrieved directly from the native layer, not the Flutter layer which is a limitation. That means that a slow frame is reported if the native layer is not keeping up with the rendering.

## Prerequisite

Before starting, ensure:

1. The Sentry Flutter SDK is initialized. Learn more [here](/platforms/flutter/#configure).
2. Tracing is set up. Learn more [here](/platforms/flutter/tracing/).
3. Routing Instrumentation is set up. Learn more [here](/platforms/flutter/integrations/routing-instrumentation/).

## Configure

This type of instrumentation is automatically enabled. There is no need for further configuration.

## Additional Configuration

### Disabling the Instrumentation

Set `enableAutoPerformanceTracing` to `false` in the options to disable the instrumentation.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  await SentryFlutter.init(
    (options) => options.enableAutoPerformanceTracing = false,
    appRunner: () => runApp(MyApp()),
  );
}
```
