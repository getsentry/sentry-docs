## Enable Tracing

Profiling depends on Sentry’s Tracing product being enabled beforehand. To enable tracing in the SDK:

<SignInNote />

```dart {diff}
SentryFlutter.init(
  (options) => {
    options.dsn = '___PUBLIC_DSN___';
+   // We recommend adjusting this value in production:
+   options.tracesSampleRate = 1.0;
  },
  appRunner: () => runApp(MyApp()),
);
```

Check out the <PlatformLink to="/tracing/">tracing setup documentation</PlatformLink> for more detailed information on how to configure sampling. Setting the sample rate to 1.0 means all transactions will be captured.

## Enable Profiling

<Note>

Flutter Profiling alpha is available for iOS and macOS since SDK version `7.12.0`.

</Note>

To enable profiling, set the `profilesSampleRate`:

<SignInNote />

```dart {diff}
SentryFlutter.init(
  (options) => {
    options.dsn = '___PUBLIC_DSN___';
    // We recommend adjusting this value in production:
    options.tracesSampleRate = 1.0;
+   // The sampling rate for profiling is relative to tracesSampleRate
+   // Setting to 1.0 will profile 100% of sampled transactions:
+   options.profilesSampleRate = 1.0;
  },
  appRunner: () => runApp(MyApp()),
);
```
