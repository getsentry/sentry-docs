## Migrating From `sentry_flutter` `6.18.x` to `sentry_flutter` `7.0.0`

In addition to the changes introduced in [sentry](/platforms/dart/migration/):

API changes:

- Sentry's Flutter SDK version 7.0.0 and above requires Flutter `3.0.0`.
- [`sentry_dio`](https://pub.dev/packages/sentry_dio), version 7.0.0 requires [`dio 5.0.0`](https://pub.dev/packages/dio)
- The Sentry Cocoa SDK was upgraded to `8.0.0` which introduces breaking changes, see the [migration guide](/platforms/apple/migration/#migrating-from-7x-to-8x).
- The following fields have been removed from the `SentryFlutterOptions` class and replaced:
  - `enableAutoPerformanceTracking` replaced with `enableAutoPerformanceTracing`.
  - `enableOutOfMemoryTracking` replaced with `enableWatchdogTerminationTracking`.
  - `anrTimeoutIntervalMillis` replaced with `anrTimeoutInterval`.
  - `autoSessionTrackingIntervalMillis` replaced with `autoSessionTrackingInterval`.
- The `enableNdkScopeSync` feature is now enabled by default.

## Migrating From `sentry_flutter` `6.12.x` to `sentry_flutter` `6.13.x`

The SDK already runs your init `callback` on an error handler, such as [`runZonedGuarded`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-async/runZonedGuarded.html) on Flutter versions prior to `3.3`, or [`PlatformDispatcher.onError`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/PlatformDispatcher/onError.html) on Flutter versions 3.3 and higher, so that errors are automatically captured. No code changes are needed on your part.

## Migrating From `sentry_flutter` `6.5.x` to `sentry_flutter` `6.6.x`

There are no Flutter-specific breaking changes. However, there are some in [sentry](/platforms/dart/migration/) for Dart.

## Migrating From `sentry_flutter` `6.3.x` to `sentry_flutter` `6.4.x`

To build a Flutter app for Android, Kotlin 1.5.31 or higher is required.
If your app uses a lower version, you will receive the following [error message](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/breaking-changes/kotlin-version#summary).

## Migrating From `sentry_flutter` `5.1.x` to `sentry_flutter` `6.0.0`

There are no Flutter specific breaking changes. However there are some in [sentry](/platforms/dart/migration/) for Dart.

## Migrating from `sentry_flutter` `5.0.0` to `sentry_flutter` `5.1.0`

# Android specific changes

You may remove `android:extractNativeLibs="true"` meta-data in the `AndroidManifest` file or `android.bundle.enableUncompressedNativeLibs=false` in the `gradle.properties` file if you're using the [Android Native Development Kit](/platforms/android/configuration/using-ndk/). Sentry can now symbolicate events with the default value of [extractNativeLibs](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/gradle-plugin#extractNativeLibs) and [android.bundle.enableUncompressedNativeLibs](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/gradle-plugin#behavior-changes).

A random generated installationId replaces [Settings.Secure.ANDROID_ID](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Settings.Secure#ANDROID_ID), which has been removed. This may affect the number of unique users displayed on the the Issues page and Alerts. If you always set a custom user using Sentry.setUser(customUser), the behavior has not changed. While you don't have to make any update, if you want to maintain the old behavior, use the following code snippet.
It makes use of the [device_info_plus](https://pub.dev/packages/device_info_plus) plugin:


```dart
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';
import 'package:device_info_plus/device_info_plus.dart';
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  await SentryFlutter.init(
    (options) {
      options.dsn = '___PUBLIC_DSN___';
      // revert to old behavior on Android
      if (defaultTargetPlatform == TargetPlatform.android && !kIsWeb) {
        options.addEventProcessor(addAndroidDeviceId);
      }
    },
    // Init your App.
    appRunner: () => runApp(MyApp()),
  );
}

FutureOr<SentryEvent?> addAndroidId(
  SentryEvent event, {
  Hint? hint,
}) async {
  var info = await DeviceInfoPlugin().androidInfo;
  var user = (event.user ?? SentryUser()).copyWith(id: info.androidId);

  return event.copyWith(
    user: user,
  );
}
```

## Migrating from `sentry_flutter` `4.0.x` to `sentry_flutter` `5.0.0`

In addition to the changes introduced in [sentry](/platforms/dart/migration/):

- `SentryFlutterOptions.enableLifecycleBreadcrumbs` was replaced with `SentryFlutterOptions.enableAppLifecycleBreadcrumbs`.
- The Web Plugin Registrant import changed from `import 'package:sentry_flutter/src/sentry_flutter_web.dart';` to `import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter_web.dart';`
  - This change may lead to breaking changes. In most cases, however, this change won't lead to breaking changes since the referencing file is auto-generated.
