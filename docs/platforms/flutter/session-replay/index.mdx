<Alert>

Flutter Session Replay is available on **iOS** and **Android**. This SDK support is still experimental as we iron out any bugs that are reported. If you encounter any issues please let us know via a GitHub ticket.

</Alert>

[Session Replay](/product/explore/session-replay/) helps you get to the root cause of an error or latency issue faster by providing you with a reproduction of what was happening in the user's device before, during, and after the issue. You can rewind and replay your application's state and see key user interactions, like taps, swipes, network requests, and console entries, in a single UI.

By default, our Session Replay SDK masks all text content, images, and user input, giving you heightened confidence that no sensitive data will leave the device. To learn more, see [product docs](/product/explore/session-replay/).

## Pre-requisites

Make sure your Sentry Flutter SDK version is at least 8.9.0, which is required for Session Replay.
You can update your `pubspec.yaml` to the matching version:

```yaml
dependencies:
  sentry_flutter: ^8.9.0
```

## Setup

To set up replay, enable it by setting a non-zero sample rate. Also, make sure you've `SentryWidget` wrapping your app:

```dart
await SentryFlutter.init(
  (options) {
    ...
    options.experimental.replay.sessionSampleRate = 1.0;
    options.experimental.replay.onErrorSampleRate = 1.0;
  },
  appRunner: () => runApp(
    SentryWidget(
      child: MyApp(),
    ),
  ),
);
```

## Verify

While you're testing, we recommend that you set `sessionSampleRate` to `1.0`. This ensures that every user session will be sent to Sentry.

Once testing is complete, **we recommend lowering this value in production**. We still recommend keeping `onErrorSampleRate` set to `1.0`.

## Sampling

Sampling allows you to control how much of your website's traffic will result in a Session Replay. There are two sample rates you can adjust to get the replays relevant to you:

1. `sessionSampleRate` - The sample rate for replays that begin recording immediately and last the entirety of a user's session.
2. `onErrorSampleRate` - The sample rate for replays that are recorded when an error happens. This type of replay will record
   up to a minute of events prior to the error and continue recording until the session ends.

Sampling starts as soon as a session begins. The `sessionSampleRate` is then evaluated. If the session is sampled, replay recording will start immediately. If not, `onErrorSampleRate` will be evaluated. If the session is sampled at this point, the replay will be buffered and will only be uploaded to Sentry if an error occurs.

## Redact Session Replay via `masking`

By default, the SDK is recording and aggressively redacting (masking) all `Text`, `EditableText`, and `Image` widgets for <PlatformLink to="/session-replay/">`Session Replay`</PlatformLink>. To modify or disable this behavior, use the `options.experimental.privacy` parameter.

<Alert level="warning">
  Modifying this parameter will also affect `masking` for
  <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/screenshots/">`Screenshots`</PlatformLink>
  .

## Error Linking

Errors that happen while a replay is running will be linked to the replay, making it possible to jump between related issues and replays. However, it's **possible** that in some cases the error count reported on the **Replays Details** page won't match the actual errors that have been captured. That's because errors can be lost, and while this is uncommon, there are a few reasons why it could happen:

- The replay was rate-limited and couldn't be accepted.
- The replay was deleted by a member of your org.
- There were network errors and the replay wasn't saved.
