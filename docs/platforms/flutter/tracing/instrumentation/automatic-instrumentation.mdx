Capturing transactions requires that you first <PlatformLink to="/tracing/">set up tracing</PlatformLink> if you haven't already.

### Routing

Sentry's routing instrumentation in Flutter automatically tracks and reports page navigation events in your app.
It supports both [standard Flutter routing](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/navigation) and the [GoRouter](https://pub.dev/packages/go_router) package.

Learn more in our [Routing Instrumentation](/platforms/flutter/integrations/routing-instrumentation/) docs.

### User Interaction

Sentry's user interaction instrumentation captures transactions and adds breadcrumbs for a set of different user interactions, which include clicks, long clicks, taps, and so on.

Learn more in our [User Interaction Instrumentation](/platforms/flutter/integrations/user-interaction-instrumentation/) docs.

### http.Client Library

Sentry's `http.Client` instrumentation captures errors and creates transaction from your HTTP requests.

Learn more in our [SentryHttpClient Instrumentation](/platforms/dart/integrations/http-integration/#performance-monitoring-for-http-requests) docs.

### Dio HTTP Library

Sentry's Dio instrumentation captures errors and creates transaction from your Dio HTTP requests.

Learn more in our [Dio Instrumentation](/platforms/dart/integrations/dio/#performance-monitoring-for-http-requests) docs.

### App Start

The app start instrumentation provides insight into how long your application takes to launch.

Learn more in our [App Start Instrumentation](/platforms/flutter/integrations/app-start-instrumentation/) docs.

### Slow and Frozen Frames

Unresponsive UI and animation hitches annoy users and degrade the user experience. Two measurements to track these types of experiences are slow frames and frozen frames. If you want your app to run smoothly, you should try to avoid both. The SDK adds these two measurements for the transactions you capture.

Slow and frozen frames are Mobile Vitals, which you can learn about in the [full documentation](/product/insights/mobile-vitals).

Learn more how to set it up in our [Slow and Frozen Frames Instrumentation](/platforms/flutter/integrations/slow-and-frozen-frames-instrumentation/) docs.

### AssetBundle Instrumentation

The [AssetBundle](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/services/AssetBundle-class.html) instrumentation provides insight into how long your app takes to load its assets, such as files.

Learn more in our [AssetBundle Instrumentation](/platforms/flutter/integrations/asset-bundle-instrumentation/) docs.

### File I/O Instrumentation

The Sentry-specific file I/O instrumentation provides insight into how long your app takes to execute File I/O operations.

Learn more about our [file I/O integration](/platforms/dart/integrations/file/).

### sqflite Database Instrumentation

The sqflite database instrumentation provides the ability to track the performance of any sqflite query.
