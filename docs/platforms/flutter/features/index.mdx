Sentry's Flutter SDK enables automatic reporting of errors and exceptions, and identifies performance issues in your application. The below, is a list of features that are available as part of this SDK.

**Features:**

- Under the hood the SDK relies on <Link to="/platforms/dart">Sentry's Dart SDK</Link>:
    - The minimum required version is `2.17.0` and Flutter SDK version is `3.0.0`.
    - This SDK includes all the <Link to="/platforms/dart/features">Features of Sentry's Dart SDK</Link>.
- Automatic native crash error tracking (using both <Link to="/platforms/android">Android</Link> and <Link to="/platforms/apple/guides/ios">iOS</Link>), including:
    - Java, Kotlin, C, and C++ code for Android.
    - ObjC, Swift, and C for iOS.
- Automatic detection of <Link to="/platforms/android/configuration/app-not-respond">Application Not Responding (ANR)</Link> on Android and <Link to="/platforms/apple/guides/ios/configuration/app-hangs/">App Hangs</Link> on iOS.
- Offline storage of events.
- Events <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/context">enriched</PlatformLink> with device data.
- Breadcrumbs automatically captured:
    - by the <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/#automatic-breadcrumbs">Flutter SDK</PlatformLink>.
    - via the Native SDKs <Link to="/platforms/android/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/#automatic-breadcrumbs">Automatic Breadcrumbs for Android</Link> and <Link to="/platforms/apple/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/#automatic-breadcrumbs">Automatic Breadcrumbs for iOS</Link>.
    - as well as `http` with the <Link to="/platforms/dart/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/#automatic-breadcrumbs">Dart SDK</Link>.
- Integrations for sqflite, routing and more. For a complete list, see <PlatformLink to="/integrations">integrations</PlatformLink>.
- <Link to="/product/releases/health">Release Health</Link> tracks crash free users and sessions.
- <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/attachments">Attachments</PlatformLink> that can enrich your event by storing additional files, such as config or log files.
- <PlatformLink to="/tracing">Tracing</PlatformLink> that can track:
  - <PlatformLink to="/integrations/app-start-instrumentation">App start time</PlatformLink>.
  - <PlatformLink to="/integrations/routing-instrumentation/#time-to-initial-display">Time to Initial Display and Time to Full Display</PlatformLink>.
  - <PlatformLink to="/integrations/slow-and-frozen-frames-instrumentation">Slow and Frozen Frames</PlatformLink>.
  - <PlatformLink to="/integrations/user-interaction-instrumentation">User Interaction</PlatformLink> which include clicks, long clicks, taps and so on.
  - For a complete list see <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation">automatic instrumentations</PlatformLink>.
- <PlatformLink to="/user-feedback">User Feedback</PlatformLink>, providing the ability to collect user feedback when an unexpected event occurs.
- <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/screenshots">Screenshot</PlatformLink> and <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/viewhierarchy">View Hierarchy</PlatformLink> attachments for errors.
- <PlatformLink to="/profiling">Profiling</PlatformLink> collects detailed information about your code at the function level.
  - Profiling is currently supported on **iOS** and **macOS**.
  - It captures profiles across multiple language layers, including native languages (such as Swift and Objective-C) as well as Dart.
- <PlatformLink to="/data-management/debug-files/source-context">Source Context</PlatformLink> shows snippets of code around the location of stack frames.
- <PlatformLink to="/upload-debug">Sentry Dart Plugin</PlatformLink> makes uploading debug symbols easy and automatic.

**Web Limitations:**

Sentry supports Flutter Web as well, with the following limitations:

- Issue titles are not human-readable, as they show the minified name.
- Stack traces aren't symbolicated when compiled using WebAssembly (WASM).
- Stack traces are not symbolicated when loaded as a browser extension.
- Offline caching isn't supported for exceptions.
- <Link to="/product/releases/health">Release Health</Link> isn't supported.
- Device context data isn't as rich on the web as it is on mobile.

**Desktop Limitations:**

Sentry supports Flutter on Linux and Windows as well, with the following limitations:

- Native crashes are not supported on Windows.
- [Release Health](/product/releases/health/) isn't supported.
- Device context data isn't as rich on Linux and Windows as it is on mobile.

When running on macOS, you can expect the same feature set as on iOS.
