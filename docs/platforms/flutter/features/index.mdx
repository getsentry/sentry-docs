<Note>

Sentry's Flutter SDK enables automatic reporting of errors, messages, and exceptions. The SDK is available on GitHub [`sentry-dart`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dart/).

</Note>

**Features:**

- Automatic native crash error tracking (using both [Android](/platforms/android/) and [iOS](/platforms/apple/)), including
    - Java, Kotlin, C, and C++ code for Android
    - ObjC, Swift, and C for iOS
- Offline storage of events
- Events [enriched](/platforms/flutter/enriching-events/context/) with device data
- Breadcrumbs automatically captured:
    - by the [Flutter SDK](/platforms/flutter/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/#automatic-breadcrumbs)
    - via the Native SDKs [Automatic Breadcrumbs for Android](/platforms/android/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/#automatic-breadcrumbs) and [Automatic Breadcrumbs for iOS](/platforms/apple/usage/#sentryautobreadcrumbtrackingintegration)
    - as well as `http` with the [Dart SDK](/platforms/dart/)
- [Release Health](/product/releases/health/) tracks crash free users and sessions
- Limited support for Flutter Web
- Under the hood the SDK relies on the [Dart SDK](/platforms/dart/); the minimum required version is `2.8.0` and Flutter SDK version is `1.17.0`.
