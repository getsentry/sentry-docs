**Web Limitations:**

Sentry supports Flutter Web as well, with the following limitations:

- Issue titles are not human-readable, as they show the minified name.
- Stack traces aren't symbolicated when compiled using WebAssembly (WASM).
- Stack traces are not symbolicated when loaded as a browser extension.
- Offline caching isn't supported for exceptions.
- <Link to="/product/releases/health">Release Health</Link> isn't supported.
- Device context data isn't as rich on the web as it is on mobile.

**Desktop Limitations:**

Sentry supports Flutter on Linux and Windows as well, with the following limitations:

- Native crashes are not supported on Windows.
- [Release Health](/product/releases/health/) isn't supported.
- Device context data isn't as rich on Linux and Windows as it is on mobile.

When running on macOS, you can expect the same feature set as on iOS.
