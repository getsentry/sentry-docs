Sentry's Flutter SDK enables automatic reporting of errors and exceptions, and identifies performance issues in your application. The below, is a list of features that are available as part of this SDK.

**Features:**

- Under the hood the SDK relies on [Sentry's Dart SDK](/platforms/dart/):
    - The minimum required version is `2.17.0` and Flutter SDK version is `3.0.0`.
    - This SDK includes all the [Features of Sentry's Dart SDK](/platforms/dart/features/)
- Automatic native crash error tracking (using both [Android](/platforms/android/) and [iOS](/platforms/apple/)), including:
    - Java, Kotlin, C, and C++ code for Android.
    - ObjC, Swift, and C for iOS.
- Offline storage of events.
- Events [enriched](/platforms/flutter/enriching-events/context/) with device data.
- Breadcrumbs automatically captured:
    - by the [Flutter SDK](/platforms/flutter/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/#automatic-breadcrumbs).
    - via the Native SDKs [Automatic Breadcrumbs for Android](/platforms/android/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/#automatic-breadcrumbs) and [Automatic Breadcrumbs for iOS](/platforms/apple/usage/#sentryautobreadcrumbtrackingintegration).
    - as well as `http` with the [Dart SDK](/platforms/dart/).
- Integrations for sqflite, routing and more. For a complete list, see our [integrations list](/platforms/flutter/integrations/).
- [Release Health](/product/releases/health/) tracks crash free users and sessions.
- [Attachments](/platforms/flutter/enriching-events/attachments/) that can enrich your event by storing additional files, such as config or log files.

  - [App start time](/platforms/flutter/integrations/app-start-instrumentation/)
  - [Time to Initial Display and Time to Full Display](/platforms/flutter/integrations/routing-instrumentation/#time-to-initial-display/)
  - [Slow and Frozen Frames](/platforms/flutter/integrations/slow-and-frozen-frames-instrumentation/)

- [Screenshot](/platforms/flutter/enriching-events/screenshots/) and [View Hierarchy](/platforms/flutter/enriching-events/viewhierarchy/) attachments for errors.
- [Profiling](/platforms/flutter/profiling/) collects detailed information about your code at the function level.
- [Source Context](/platforms/flutter/data-management/debug-files/source-context/) shows snippets of code around the location of stack frames.
- [Sentry Dart Plugin](/platforms/flutter/upload-debug/) makes uploading debug symbols easy and automatic.
