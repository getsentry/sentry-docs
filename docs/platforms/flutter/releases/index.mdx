The Flutter SDK uses the following channels to release SDK updates:

## `Pre-release`

Pre-releases (alpha, beta, RC,â€¦) are for larger and potentially more impactful changes, such as new features or major versions.

## `Latest`

We continuously release major/minor/hotfix versions from the `main` branch. These releases go through all our internal quality gates and are very safe to use. They're intended to be the default for most teams.

## `Stable`

Releases are promoted from `Latest` to `Stable` when they've been used in the field for some time and at some scale. The length of time a release has been out, the level of adoption, and other quality and stability metrics are all considered before a release is deemed `Stable`. These types of releases will have a `Stable` label on the <Link to="https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dart/releases/">releases page</Link>.

## FAQ

### Where can I find the latest stable release for any given SDK?

On the <Link to="https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dart/releases/">releases page</Link> of the SDK's GitHub repo. Stable releases will have the `Stable` label in the name of the release. You can also use the search box in the top right to search for the newest releases.

### Does this mean the release channels are not stable?

No. Stability and performance are the top priorities for every release. The `Stable` release status means that the release has been tested and proven to work in the wild and at scale.

### How often do we mark SDKs as stable?

The stable release cycle depends on a number of factors and can vary, but the target cadence is to provide stable releases roughly every month.

### Should I only use stable releases?

We leave this decision up to you. Stable releases have been tested in the field and at significant scale. They are intended for a dependable and consistent experience. Please note that the `Stable` release channel will get our newest features later than other releases.

### How does this relate to the stability of a feature?

A `Stable` release status doesn't guarantee the stability of an SDK feature or product feature. A new feature that's still experimental might be part of a stable SDK release. Any experimental features will be clearly marked and offered as an opt-in.
