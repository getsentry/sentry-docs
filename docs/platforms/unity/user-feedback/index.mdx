<Alert level="info">

The User Feedback Prefab is available in Unity SDK version 4.0.0, which is currently in beta.

</Alert>

When a user experiences an error, Sentry provides the ability to collect additional feedback. The Unity SDK provides both a simple prefab-based solution and a programmatic API for collecting user feedback.

## Use the User Feedback Prefab

The Unity SDK includes a ready-to-use prefab that provides a complete user feedback solution. This prefab contains:

- A feedback button (megaphone icon) that opens the feedback form
- A feedback form with fields for:
  - Name (optional)
  - Email (optional)
  - Message/feedback (required)
  - Screenshot (optional, taken automatically)

### Adding the Prefab to Your Scene

1. Drag and drop the User Feedback prefab from the Unity SDK package into any scene
2. The prefab includes a scaling canvas that works across different screen sizes and resolutions
3. The prefab is ready to use immediately without any additional configuration

### Customization

You can customize the feedback form by:

- Creating a prefab variant to inherit from the original while allowing updates
- Removing optional fields (name, email) by deleting them from the VerticalLayoutGroup
- Modifying the appearance and styling of the form elements
- The prefab comes with a custom inspector that highlights missing or broken references:
  - Missing optional fields are highlighted in yellow
  - Missing required fields are highlighted in red

## Use the .NET SDK API

<Alert>

User Feedback for **[ASP.NET](/platforms/dotnet/guides/aspnet/user-feedback/#integration)** or **[ASP.NET Core](/platforms/dotnet/guides/aspnetcore/user-feedback/#integration)** supply integrations specific to supporting those SDKs.

</Alert>

If you prefer to create your own feedback form or need programmatic control, you can use the SDK's API to send feedback to Sentry:

```csharp {tabTitle:C#}
var eventId = SentrySdk.CaptureMessage("An event that will receive user feedback.");

SentrySdk.CaptureFeedback("It broke.", "user@example.com", "The User", associatedEventId: eventId);
```
