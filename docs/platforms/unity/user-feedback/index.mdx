When a user experiences an error, Sentry provides the ability to collect additional feedback. You can collect feedback according to the method supported by the SDK.

## Use the .NET SDK

<Note>

User Feedback for **[ASP.NET](/platforms/dotnet/guides/aspnet/user-feedback/#integration)** or **[ASP.NET Core](/platforms/dotnet/guides/aspnetcore/user-feedback/#integration)** supply integrations specific to supporting those SDKs.

</Note>

You can create a form to collect the user input in your preferred framework, and use the SDK's API to send the information to Sentry. You can also use the widget, as described below. If you'd prefer an alternative to the widget or do not have a JavaScript frontend, you can use this API:

```csharp {tabTitle:C#}
using Sentry;

var eventId = SentrySdk.CaptureMessage("An event that will receive user feedback.");

SentrySdk.CaptureUserFeedback(eventId, "user@example.com", "It broke.", "The User");
```

```fsharp {tabTitle:F#}
open Sentry

let eventId = SentrySdk.CaptureMessage("An event that will receive user feedback.")

SentrySdk.CaptureUserFeedback(eventId, "user@example.com", "It broke.", "The User")
```
