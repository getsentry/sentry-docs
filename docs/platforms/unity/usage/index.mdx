Sentry's SDK hooks into the game engine and automatically reports errors, uncaught exceptions, as well as other types of errors depending on the platform.

<Alert>

Key terms:

- An _event_ is one instance of sending data to Sentry. Generally, this data is an error or exception.
- An _issue_ is a grouping of similar events.
- The reporting of an event is called _capturing_.
  When an event is captured, it's sent to Sentry.

</Alert>

By default, the Sentry Unity SDK automatically captures errors through Unity's logging system. For details on this see the [Automatic Error Capture documentation](/platforms/unity/usage/automatic-error-capture/).

In addition to automatic capture, you can manually capture errors, exceptions, and messages as described below.

## Capturing Errors

The most common form of capturing is to capture errors. In Unity C# code, you can use `SentrySdk.CaptureException(exception)` to explicitly report exceptions and mark them as `handled`.

```csharp
try
{
    AFunctionThatMightFail();
}
catch (Exception e)
{
    SentrySdk.CaptureException(e);
}
```

While capturing an event, these get also recorded as breadcrumbs that lead up to the next event. Breadcrumbs are different from events: they will not create an event in Sentry, but will be buffered until the next event is sent. Learn more about breadcrumbs in our <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/">Breadcrumbs documentation</PlatformLink>.

### Ignoring Errors

You can ignore exceptions by their type when initializing the SDK:

```csharp
// Add this to the SDK initialization callback
options.AddExceptionFilterForType<OperationCanceledException>();
```

This modifies the behavior of the [entire inheritance chain](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/inheritance#background-what-is-inheritance). As a result, the example code will also filter out `TaskCanceledException` since it is derived from `OperationCanceledException`.

## Capturing Messages

Another common operation is to capture a bare message. A message is textual information that should be sent to Sentry. The SDK will [automatically capture messages](/platforms/unity/usage/automatic-error-capture/) created through `Debug.LogError()`. You can opt out of this behaviour on the `Logging` tab in the editor (Tools->Sentry).

Messages show up as issues on your issue stream, with the message as the issue name.

```csharp
SentrySdk.CaptureMessage("Something went wrong");
```

<Alert>

By default, the SDK only provides a stack trace for captured exceptions. To provide a stack trace in message events, captured either through `SentrySdk.CaptureMessage` or `Debug.LogError`, you need to set `AttachStacktrace` to `true` in the `Logging` tab in the editor (Tools->Sentry).
