Sentry supports [PlayStation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/playstation/), [Xbox](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/xbox/) and [Nintendo Switch](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/nintendo-switch/) via the Unity SDK.  Once you submit the middleware verification process, we'll reach out and send you an invite to our private GitHub repositories with console specific code.
This allows your configuration and custom data set via C# to show up in C# exceptions as well as crash dumps on these console platforms.
