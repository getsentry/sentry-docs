Sentry supports [PlayStation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/playstation/), [Xbox](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/xbox/) and [Nintendo Switch](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/nintendo-switch/) via the Unity SDK. The Unity SDK automatically handles console-specific configurations when building for these platforms.

The Unity SDK leverages platform-specific native SDKs under the hood to provide comprehensive error tracking for console platforms, ensuring optimal performance and native crash capture capabilities.

## Xbox

Once you have access to Xbox development resources, the Unity SDK will automatically configure itself for Xbox builds using the underlying [Native SDK](/platforms/native/) for optimal crash reporting and error tracking.

## PlayStation

<Alert>

The Unity SDK automatically handles PlayStation-specific configurations when building for PS5. Crash capturing works out of the box, and additional context like breadcrumbs and tags are captured through the Unity SDK's built-in features.

## Nintendo Switch

The Unity SDK provides comprehensive support for Nintendo Switch development through Unity's standard Sentry integration.

## Unity-Specific Console Features

When developing for consoles with Unity, the Sentry SDK provides additional features:

- **Automatic Platform Detection**: The SDK automatically detects the target console platform and configures itself accordingly
- **Native Crash Handling**: Leverages platform-specific native SDKs for optimal crash capture on each console
- **Unity-specific Context**: Captures Unity scene information, GameObject details, and Unity-specific breadcrumbs
- **Console Performance Monitoring**: Track frame rates, memory usage, and other Unity-specific performance metrics
- **Cross-Platform Development**: Maintain consistent error tracking across development (PC), testing (devkit), and retail console builds

For detailed configuration options specific to your Unity console project, see the [Unity configuration documentation](/platforms/unity/configuration/).
