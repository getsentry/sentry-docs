When you add Sentry to your app, you get a lot of valuable information about errors and performance. And lots of information is good -- as long as it's the right information, at a reasonable volume.

The Sentry SDKs have several configuration options to help you filter out events.

We also offer [Inbound Filters](/concepts/data-management/filtering/) to filter events in sentry.io. We recommend filtering at the client level though, because it removes the overhead of sending events you don't actually want. Learn more about the [fields available in an event](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/data-model/event-payloads/).

## Filtering Error Events

Configure your SDK to filter error events by using the <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send" /> callback method and configuring, enabling, or disabling integrations.

### Using <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send" />

All Sentry SDKs support the <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send" /> callback method. Because it's called immediately before the event is sent to the server, this is your last chance to decide not to send data or to edit it. <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send" /> receives the event object as a parameter, which you can use to either modify the eventâ€™s data or drop it completely by returning `null`, based on custom logic and the data available on the event.

<PlatformContent includePath="configuration/before-send/" />

Note also that breadcrumbs can be filtered, as discussed in [our Breadcrumbs documentation](/product/error-monitoring/breadcrumbs/).

## Filtering Transaction Events

To prevent certain transactions from being reported to Sentry, use the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> or <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send-transaction" /> configuration option, which allows you to provide a function to evaluate the current transaction and drop it if it's not one you want.

### Using <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" />

**Note:** The <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> and <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> config options are mutually exclusive. If you define a <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> to filter out certain transactions, you must also handle the case of non-filtered transactions by returning the rate at which you'd like them sampled.

In its simplest form, used just for filtering the transaction, it looks like this:

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/traces-sampler-as-filter" />

It also allows you to sample different transactions at different rates.

If the transaction currently being processed has a parent transaction (from an upstream service calling this service), the parent (upstream) sampling decision will always be included in the sampling context data, so that your <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> can choose whether and when to inherit that decision. In most cases, inheritance is the right choice, to avoid breaking distributed traces. A broken trace will not include all your services. See <PlatformLink to="/configuration/sampling/#inheritance">Inheriting the parent sampling decision</PlatformLink> to learn more.
