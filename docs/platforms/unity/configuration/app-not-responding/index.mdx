Application Not Responding (ANR) errors are triggered when the Unity thread of the game is blocked for more than five seconds. The Unity SDK reports ANR errors as Sentry events.

## ANR Implementation Details

The ANR detection in the Unity SDK strictly works within the Unity game, irrespective of the targeted platform and works in two parts. First the SDK starts a coroutine that periodically notes the time it last got called. Second, a background thread checks the time since the last update against the ANR threshold from the options.
The detection is sensitive of the app losing and regaining focus and gets paused accordingly. It is also using `WaitForSecondsRealtime` so pausing your game by modifying the `Time.timeScale` will not trigger false ANR reports.

On platforms that do no support multithreading the ANR detection falls back to relying on the coroutine itself to report if the last time it executed exceeds the timeout.

### Stack Trace Support

Since the ANR integration creates an exception on a background thread, based on a coroutine not resetting in time, the stack trace will not show the main thread's stack trace.

### Line Number Support

Since the Unity SDKs [line number support](/platforms/unity/configuration/il2cpp) is limited to actually thrown exceptions, the integration does not provide you with line numbers in the captured ANR issues.

## Configuration

ANR detection is enabled by default in Sentry, but you can opt-out through the editor window by going to `Tools -> Sentry -> Advanced -> ANR Detection`. You can also set the ANR timeout there.

You can also opt out by disabling the integration.

```csharp
options.DisableAnrIntegration();
```

To set the timeout use the following snippet.

```csharp
options.AnrTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5);
```
