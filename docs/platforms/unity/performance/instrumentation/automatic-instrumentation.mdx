## Automatically Captured Transactions

The Unity SDK automatically creates transactions for the game's startup and scene loading. 

If you want the SDK to also generate spans for all `Awake` calls during startup and scene operations, you can enable the following settings through the Editor Config Window or <Link to="/platforms/unity/configuration/options/#programmatic-configuration">programmatically</Link>.

```csharp
public override void Configure(SentryUnityOptions options)
{
    options.AutoSceneLoadTraces = true;
    options.AutoStartupTraces = true;
}
```

After you've configured your instrumentation, the Unity SDK will generate traces as shown in the image below.
