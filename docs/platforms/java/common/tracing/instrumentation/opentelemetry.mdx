There are multiple ways to configure your [OpenTelemetry SDK](https://opentelemetry.io/) and send traces and spans to Sentry. They're described below.

<PlatformSection supported={["java.spring", "java.spring-boot"]} notSupported={["java"]}>
If you're unsure whether to use the Java Agent, please have a look at [what the OpenTelemetry SDK has to say about this](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/zero-code/java/spring-boot-starter/).

## Using `sentry-opentelemetry-agent` With Auto Initialization

If you use `sentry-opentelemetry-agent`, it will look for `SENTRY_DSN` and `SENTRY_PROPERTIES_FILE` environment variables to be defined, and then initialize Sentry automatically. You'll just need to configure your `DSN` and `tracesSampleRate`.

### Install

### Usage

### Debugging

### Turn Off Exporter Error Messages

## Using `sentry-opentelemetry-agent` Without Auto-Initialization

You may also disable automatic initialization of Sentry in `sentry-opentelemetry-agent` by setting `SENTRY_AUTO_INIT=false` as an environment variable. Doing this will mean you'll either have to use another Sentry integration that performs initialization, (for example Spring Boot), or initialize Sentry manually.

## Using OpenTelemetry Without Any Java Agent

If the Java Agent approach isn't for you, you can manually initialize OpenTelemetry. We have a separate dependency for this use case.

### Install

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/opentelemetry-install/without-java-agent" />

### Usage

You'll have to configure both OpenTelemetry and Sentry to see transactions in Sentry and have errors linked to transactions created by OpenTelemetry.

## OpenTelemetry and Sentry

With Sentryâ€™s OpenTelemetry SDK, an OpenTelemetry `Span` becomes a Sentry `Transaction` or `Span`. The first `Span` sent through the Sentry `SpanProcessor` is a `Transaction`, and any child `Span` gets attached to the first `Transaction` upon checking the parent `Span` context. This is true for the OpenTelemetry root `Span` and any top level `Span` in the system. For example, a request sent from frontend to backend will create an OpenTelemetry root `Span` with a corresponding Sentry `Transaction`. The backend request will create a new Sentry `Transaction` for the OpenTelemetry `Span`. The Sentry `Transaction` and `Span` are linked as a trace for navigation and error tracking purposes.

### Manual Instrumentation with OpenTelemetry

If you have the OpenTelemetry SDK in you classpath, you can also instrument your code manually using the OpenTelemetry API as documented [in the OpenTelemetry docs](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/java/api/#span).

A manually created span for HTTP requests needs to declare its `SpanKind` as well as the `HttpAttributes.HTTP_REQUEST_METHOD` attribute, so that `Sentry` can correctly process these:

```java {tabTitle:Java}
Span span = tracer.spanBuilder("myspan")
  .setAttribute(HTTP_REQUEST_METHOD, "GET")
  .setSpanKind(SpanKind.SERVER)
  .startSpan();
```
```kotlin {tabTitle:Kotlin}
val span = tracer.spanBuilder("myspan")
  .setAttribute(HTTP_REQUEST_METHOD, "GET")
  .setSpanKind(SpanKind.SERVER)
  .startSpan()
```

### Capturing HTTP Headers

By default OpenTelemetry does not capture any HTTP headers. This, however, can be configured using system properties or environment variables as per OpenTelemetry's configuration documentation [here](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/zero-code/java/agent/instrumentation/http/#capturing-http-request-and-response-headers). Each variable is a comma-separated list of HTTP header names that should be captured.

#### Client variables

- `OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_HTTP_CLIENT_CAPTURE_REQUEST_HEADERS`
- `OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_HTTP_CLIENT_CAPTURE_RESPONSE_HEADERS`

#### Server variables

- `OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_HTTP_SERVER_CAPTURE_REQUEST_HEADERS`
- `OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_HTTP_SERVER_CAPTURE_RESPONSE_HEADERS`

## Additional Configuration

If you need more fine grained control over Sentry, take a look at the <PlatformLink to="/configuration/">Configuration page</PlatformLink>. In case you'd like to filter out transactions before sending them to Sentry (to get rid of health checks, for example), you may find the <PlatformLink to="/configuration/filtering/#filtering-transaction-events">Filtering page</PlatformLink> helpful.
