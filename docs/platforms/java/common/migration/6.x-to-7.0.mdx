## Migrating from `io.sentry:sentry` `6.x` to `io.sentry:sentry` `7.0.0`

### Breaking Changes

- The `sentry-android-okhttp` classes were deprecated in favor of `sentry-okhttp`, which is a pure Java module and can be used in non-Android projects. Check the [OkHttp Integration](/platforms/java/tracing/instrumentation/okhttp) documentation to see how to use it.
  - The `SentryOkHttpUtils` class was removed from the public API. If you were using it, consider filing a [feature request](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/issues).
- If you're using `sentry-kotlin-extensions`, it now requires `kotlinx-coroutines-core` version `1.6.1` or higher.
- Changed the return type of `SentryApolloInterceptor.BeforeSpanCallback` from `ISpan` to `ISpan?`.
- `Scope` now implements the `IScope` interface, therefore some methods like `ScopeCallback.run` accept `IScope` now.
- Some `Sentry.startTransaction` overloads do not exist anymore, and instead, you can set old options by passing a `TransactionOptions` object in.

For example:

```kotlin
// old
val transaction = Sentry.startTransaction("name", "op", bindToScope = true)
// new
val transaction = Sentry.startTransaction("name", "op", TransactionOptions().apply { isBindToScope = true })
```

### Behavioral Changes

- The SDK now captures failed HTTP and GraphQL (Apollo) requests by default.
  - This can increase your event consumption and may affect your quota, because the SDK will report failed network requests as Sentry events if you're using the `sentry-okhttp` or `sentry-apollo-3` integrations by default. You can customize what errors you want/don't want to have reported for [OkHttp](/platforms/java/tracing/instrumentation/okhttp/#http-client-errors) and [Apollo3](/platforms/java/tracing/instrumentation/apollo3/#graphql-client-errors) respectively.
- The SDK now sets `ip_address` to \{\{auto}} by default, even if sendDefaultPII is disabled.
  - We recommend you instead use the "Prevent Storing of IP Addresses" option in the "Security & Privacy" project settings on [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/).
- The `maxSpans` setting (defaults to 1000) is now enforced for nested child spans. This means a single transaction can have `maxSpans` number of children (nested or not) at most.

### Sentry Self-hosted Compatibility

- Starting with version `7.0.0` of the SDK, [Sentry's version >= v22.12.0](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/releases) is required to properly ingest transactions with unfinished spans. This only applies to self-hosted Sentry. If you are using [sentry.io](https://sentry.io), no action is needed.
