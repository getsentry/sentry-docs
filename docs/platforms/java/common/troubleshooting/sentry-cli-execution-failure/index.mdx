The Sentry Maven plugin may fail to execute `sentry-cli` in certain environments.

## Symptoms

A build using `sentry-maven-plugin` fails during execution of `sentry-cli` (e.g. to collect and upload a source bundle).

## Solution

First, enable debug logs for both the plugin and `sentry-cli`, by setting

```xml
<debug>false</debug>
<debugSentryCli>true</debugSentryCli>
```

in your `<configuration>` for `sentry-maven-plugin`.

You might see similar lines in the logs:

```
[ERROR] Error while attempting to run Sentry CLI:
org.apache.maven.plugin.MojoExecutionException: An Ant BuildException has occured: Execute failed: java.io.IOException: Cannot run program "/bin/sh" [...]
```

A possible solution is to add the following JVM option to switch the process launch mechanism to `vfork`:

```bash
-Djdk.lang.Process.launchMechanism=vfork
```
