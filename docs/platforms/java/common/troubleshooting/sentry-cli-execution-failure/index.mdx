The Sentry Maven plugin may fail to execute Sentry CLI in certain environments.

## Symptoms

- A build using `sentry-maven-plugin` fails during execution of `sentry-cli` (e.g. to collect and upload a source bundle).
- Enabling debug logs for `sentry-cli` doesn't show meaningful errors from `sentry-cli` itself.

To enable debug logs, set

```xml
<debug>false</debug>
<debugSentryCli>true</debugSentryCli>
```

in your `<configuration>` for `sentry-maven-plugin`.

You might see similar lines in the logs:

```
[ERROR] Error while attempting to run Sentry CLI:
org.apache.maven.plugin.MojoExecutionException: An Ant BuildException has occured: Execute failed: java.io.IOException: Cannot run program "/bin/sh" [...]
```

## Solution

Add the following JVM option to switch the process launch mechanism to `vfork`:

```bash
-Djdk.lang.Process.launchMechanism=vfork
```
