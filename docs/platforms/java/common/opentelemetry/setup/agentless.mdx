If you do not want to use our recommended <PlatformLink to="/opentelemetry/setup/agent">Java Agent</PlatformLink>, we also offer a dependency that allows you to use OpenTelemetry with Sentry.

## Install

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/opentelemetry-install/without-java-agent" />

## Usage

You'll have to configure both OpenTelemetry and Sentry to see transactions in Sentry and have errors linked to transactions created by OpenTelemetry.

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/opentelemetry-setup/without-java-agent" />
