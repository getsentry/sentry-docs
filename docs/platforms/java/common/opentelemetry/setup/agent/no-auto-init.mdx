You may also disable automatic initialization of Sentry in `sentry-opentelemetry-agent` by setting `SENTRY_AUTO_INIT=false` as an environment variable. Doing this will mean you'll either have to use another Sentry integration that performs initialization, (for example Spring Boot), or initialize Sentry manually.
