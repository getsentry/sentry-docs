There are multiple ways to configure our OpenTelemetry integration. You may chose between using our Java Agent or using one of our agentless dependencies.

## OTLP

If you want OpenTelemetry to handle tracing and export spans via OTLP directly to Sentry, while Sentry handles errors, logs, and metrics, you can use the `sentry-opentelemetry-otlp` module. This is a lightweight integration where Sentry only reads the trace and span IDs from the OpenTelemetry `Context` to correlate its events with OpenTelemetry traces. Unlike the Agent and Agentless integrations above, it does not use OpenTelemetry for scope storage or span creation within the Sentry SDK.
