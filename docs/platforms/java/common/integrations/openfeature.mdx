The [OpenFeature](https://openfeature.dev/) integration tracks feature flag evaluations produced by the OpenFeature SDK. This SDK is supported by a broad range of feature flagging providers. For the full list, visit [OpenFeature's ecosystem page](https://openfeature.dev/ecosystem?instant_search%5BrefinementList%5D%5Btype%5D%5B0%5D=Provider&instant_search%5BrefinementList%5D%5BallTechnologies%5D%5B0%5D=Java).

The flag evaluations are held in memory and are sent to Sentry on error and transaction events. **At the moment, we only support boolean flag evaluations.**

## Install

To install use:

```groovy {tabTitle:Gradle}
implementation 'io.sentry:sentry-openfeature:{{@inject packages.version('sentry.java.openfeature', '8.27.0') }}'
```

```xml {tabTitle:Maven}
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.sentry</groupId>
    <artifactId>sentry-openfeature</artifactId>
    <version>{{@inject packages.version('sentry.java.openfeature', '8.27.0') }}</version>
</dependency>
```

```scala {tabTitle: SBT}
libraryDependencies += "io.sentry" % "sentry-openfeature" % "{{@inject packages.version('sentry.java.openfeature', '8.27.0') }}"
```

For other dependency managers, check out the [central Maven repository](https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.sentry/sentry-openfeature).

Before using this integration, you need to install and instrument the [OpenFeature Java SDK](https://openfeature.dev/docs/reference/technologies/server/java) in your app. Learn more by reading OpenFeature's [SDK docs](https://openfeature.dev/docs/reference/technologies/server/java) and [provider docs](https://openfeature.dev/docs/reference/concepts/provider).

## Configure

Add `SentryOpenFeatureHook` to your OpenFeature setup:

```java {5}
import dev.openfeature.sdk.OpenFeatureAPI;
import io.sentry.openfeature.SentryOpenFeatureHook;

OpenFeatureAPI api = OpenFeatureAPI.getInstance();
api.addHooks(new SentryOpenFeatureHook());
```

```kotlin {5}
import dev.openfeature.sdk.OpenFeatureAPI
import io.sentry.openfeature.SentryOpenFeatureHook

val api: OpenFeatureAPI = OpenFeatureAPI.getInstance()
api.addHooks(SentryOpenFeatureHook())
```

## Verify

The integration is tested by evaluating a feature flag using your OpenFeature SDK before capturing an exception:

```java
import dev.openfeature.sdk.OpenFeatureAPI;
import io.sentry.Sentry;

OpenFeatureAPI api = OpenFeatureAPI.getInstance();
var client = api.getClient();

boolean flagValue = client.getBooleanValue("test-flag", false);

Sentry.captureException(new Exception("Something went wrong!"));
```

```kotlin
import dev.openfeature.sdk.OpenFeatureAPI
import io.sentry.Sentry

val api: OpenFeatureAPI = OpenFeatureAPI.getInstance()
val client = api.client

val flagValue: Boolean = client.getBooleanValue("test-flag", false)

Sentry.captureException(Exception("Something went wrong!"))
```

Open your Sentry project and confirm that your error event has recorded the feature flag "test-flag" and its value "false".
