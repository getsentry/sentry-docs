Similar to Spring MVC, Sentry offers support for Spring WebFlux. When developing a reactive web application, Sentry Spring Boot Starter creates the infrastructure required for capturing errors triggered during HTTP request processing.

The minimum version of Spring Boot supported by the Sentry WebFlux integration is `v2.2.5.RELEASE`.
