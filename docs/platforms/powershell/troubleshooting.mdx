## The event is dropped by Sentry because it's too large

> Sentry: (Error) Sentry rejected the envelope 5bfe4129cb2446c08768b16479865035. Status code: RequestEntityTooLarge. Error detail: failed to read request body. Error causes: A payload reached size limit.

You can have the [Sentry SDK write these envelopes to a path](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dotnet/blob/e62013ca63436d2a786fb229570e96f42c7c4044/src/Sentry/Http/HttpTransportBase.cs#L341-L363) in order to troubleshoot why they are too large.
Set the environment variable `SENTRY_KEEP_LARGE_ENVELOPE_PATH` to the directory you want these to be written to.
Make sure the process the SDK is running in has write access to it.

## Unhandled exceptions are not captured

Currently, the SDK captures exceptions that are explicitly handled by ane of the following methods:
- piping the `ErrorRecord` inside a `catch` statement or in a `trap` using `$_ | Out-Sentry`
- using `Invoke-WithSentry { ... }`
