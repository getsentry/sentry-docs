Application crashes due to stack overflow differ from other crashes from the handler's perspective because the handler
relies on the resource that ran out: stack space. Since the handler typically runs on the thread whose stack overflowed,
it can no longer use stack variables or call functions. This results in a crashed application without sending a report that
it happened.

How to handle this issue is different from platform to platform, but options boil down to:

* allocating a stack that only the crash handler can use (Linux/POSIX and Windows)
* running the handler in a separate thread (or process), which will receive a message of the crash asynchronously (macOS)

Independent of whether an application crashed due to a stack overflow or not, handlers should make minimal use of the
stack because even if there was no stack overflow, the amount of stack available to the handler could be limited. This is
especially true for users who use the `on_crash` or `before_send` hook over which Sentry has no control.

On Linux (and other `POSIX` systems), users should preallocate everything before their hooks run and only move data into
preallocated storage because heap allocations can also fail inside the signal handler (constructing `sentry_value_t` is
okay because we use a safe allocator inside the signal handler). See also:
[What to consider when writing on_crash hooks](/platforms/native/advanced-usage/signal-handling/#what-to-consider-when-writing-on_crash-hooks).

## How do OSes differ, and how can Sentry help?

### Windows

The Windows API provides a [thread-stack guarantee interface](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-setthreadstackguarantee)
where users can give a size in bytes reserved for the handler to run in case of a crash. However, this size is subtracted
from the thread stack reserve as it is a direct continuation inside the thread stack, not a separate allocation or
memory region.

The developer must weigh the thread stack reserve against the handler's guarantee during regular operation.
Otherwise, the guarantee used for the handler could eat enough stack space to lead to an overflow.

This should not be the case for most threads on Windows, which have a default stack reserve of 1MiB (whereas the
required handler guarantee will be only 10s of KiB). However, some threads created by specific runtimes or the kernel
(for drivers) might have much smaller stack reserves, where a handler guarantee of 32KiB could already be half or all
the stack available to the thread.

In short, while Windows provides a very high-level request interface ("guarantee me x bytes for my handler"), it is not
flexible regarding the location of the guaranteed handler stack. As such, you must consider the size of the guarantee in
the context of the stack reserve and the actual stack use in a particular thread. The latter is hard to do for threads
you do not control.

Also, you'll need to request the stack guarantee from within the thread you want to specify. You cannot set a
guarantee from the outside, which typically limits you to the threads you own.

On Windows, the Native SDK automatically sets a stack guarantee of 64KiB for all threads that start after loading it as
a shared library. For static library builds, we only automatically set the stack guarantee for the thread that calls
`sentry_init()`.

If you need to set stack guarantees manually, you can use the Win32 API directly. A once-set guarantee amount cannot be
decreased through the Win32 API; it can only be increased. We also provide `sentry_set_thread_stack_guarantee()` on top
of the Win32 function, which includes helpful logging and prevents overriding a previously set stack guarantee.

The auto initialization is also defensive in requesting the stack reserve for each thread it runs on, and only attempts
to set a guarantee if the reserve is at least, by default, 10 times larger than the requested default guarantee.

You can parameterize this behavior to suit your use case by:

* changing the default handler stack using the compile-time parameter `SENTRY_HANDLER_STACK_SIZE`.
* disabling auto-initialization altogether using the compile-time option `SENTRY_THREAD_STACK_GUARANTEE_AUTO_INIT`
* tuning the relative allowance between the stack reserve and the handler guarantee using the compile-time parameter `SENTRY_THREAD_STACK_GUARANTEE_FACTOR`
* enabling more detailed logging during tuning parameters with `SENTRY_THREAD_STACK_GUARANTEE_VERBOSE_LOG`

These parameters are documented in more detail in the section on compile-time options of
[the Native SDK's README](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-native?tab=readme-ov-file#compile-time-options).

### Linux or OSes that primarily use POSIX signal handlers

When you use POSIX signal handlers, you can specify a `sigaltstack`. This alternative signal stack allows the kernel to
continue the handler stack even if the crashed and preempted thread stack runs out.

This relatively low-level interface allows users to specify an arbitrary memory range (on the heap, stack or any memory
mapping a user can access). The upside of allowing the user to determine the size _and_ location offers flexibility
compared to the Windows approach because it is independent of the stack usage and size of the crashed thread and allows
you to add additional bounds like protected regions around the handler stack.

However, it also adds environmental complexity because a badly placed or incorrectly set up memory region could lead to
hard-to-identify bugs (consider a handler stack inside the heap, where a handler overflow caused by a stack hungry
`on_crash` implementation could lead to arbitrary heap corruption).

Like Windows, you can only assign a `sigaltstack` from within the thread, meaning you can only set the handler region
for threads you own.

On Linux, `crashpad` and `breakpad` provide their own `sigaltstack` initialization, currently not influenced by Sentry:

* `breakpad` typically allocates 16KiB or `SIGSTKSZ` if it is bigger.
* `crashpad` allocates `SIGSTKSZ` + your system's page size and aligns it to the page size (which will lead to 16KiB or
32KiB on most systems)

Both `breakpad` and `crashpad` will only specify a `sigaltstack` if none exists or the one defined is smaller than
the target size. `breakpad` allocates the alternate stack on the heap. `crashpad` creates a separate memory mapping that
includes a guard page.

The `inproc` backend uses the handler stack size specified in [`SENTRY_HANDLER_STACK_SIZE`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-native?tab=readme-ov-file#compile-time-options)
and only sets up a `sigaltstack` if none has been defined. Like `breakpad`, it allocates the handler stack on the heap.

<Alert>
All backends currently only set up the `sigaltstack` for the thread that initializes the Native SDK. All other threads
must get their own `sigaltstack` setup since no auto-initialization, like on Windows, exists on Linux.
</Alert>

### Android

Android automatically configures every thread to use a `sigaltstack` size of 16KiB (on 32-bit systems) and 32KiB (on
64-bit systems). The Android team recommends not overriding these because configuration inconsistencies with the signal
stacks provided by Android can lead to crashes in regular runtime operation. The `inproc` backend of the Native SDK used
in the Android integration will not define a `sigaltstack` on Linux/Android if one is already specified. Thus, only the
default `sigaltstack` will be used on Android, and you can be sure one exists for each thread.

### macOS, when using Mach exception port listeners

The Mach exception port listener typically blocks in a separate thread until the kernel delivers a Mach exception. Since
the listener thread is entirely independent of the thread that crashed, an exception caused by a stack overflow will
never affect the available stack for the handler. This is even more true for `crashpad` on macOS, where the handler
doesn't only run in a separate thread but in a separate process.

<Alert>
This means that when using `breakpad` or `crashpad` on macOS, handling a stack overflow does not require any different setup
or care than other crashes.
</Alert>

<Alert>
Be aware that, in contrast to Mach exception port usage, signal handlers on macOS run on the same thread that caused the
signal and thus also need a `sigaltstack` to handle any crash from a stack overflow. Only the `inproc` backend on macOS
currently relies entirely on signal handlers, and its signal stack is set up equivalently to Linux or other POSIX platforms.
