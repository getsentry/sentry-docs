This section details recurring topics where the knowledge beyond what the SDK boundary can abstract away from its users no longer holds.

These will include operating system specifics regarding error handling or how some platforms deviate from established standards.

This section is not a conclusive reference documentation but will cover solutions that a user should understand to adapt to particular platform behavior.

While we try to keep the content light, due to the in-depth nature of the topics following the text might require more effort than the other parts of the documentation.
