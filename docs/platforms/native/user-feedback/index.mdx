Sentry makes it possible to collect additional feedback when a user experiences an error. You can collect feedback according to the method supported by your SDK of choice.

## User Feedback API

The user feedback API allows you to collect user feedback using your own UI. You can use the same programming language you have in your app to then send the feedback. In this case, the SDK creates the HTTP request so you don't have to deal with posting data via HTTP.

Sentry pairs the feedback with the original event, giving you additional insight into issues. In order to do this, Sentry needs the `eventId`. For example, to get the `eventId`, you can use <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#before-send"><PlatformIdentifier name="before-send" /></PlatformLink> or the return value of the method capturing an event.

<PlatformContent includePath="user-feedback/sdk-api-example/" />

Alternatively, you can use the [User Feedback API endpoint](/api/projects/submit-user-feedback/) directly.
