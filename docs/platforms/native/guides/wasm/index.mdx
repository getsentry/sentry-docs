title: WebAssembly
description: "Learn about how Sentry processes WASM crash reports."
---

WebAssembly allows you to compile native code into a platform-independent bytecode format, which, for example, permits you to run native C, C++, or Rust code in a web browser.

**This feature is still developing, so may be rough around the edges.**

Debugging support for WebAssembly is an ongoing effort by the WebAssembly community.
Support for it in Sentry is limited by what's possible in that ecosystem.

## Requirements

As of now it's possible to get crash reports uploaded to Sentry if your compiler can
output [WASM DWARF debug information](https://yurydelendik.github.io/webassembly-dwarf/)
alongside the binary code. In addition, you need to upload your WebAssembly
debug information files to Sentry or use a symbol server as you
would for our other platforms.

For this process to work, we require debug information files to be augmented by a
`build_id` custom section. We provide a tool called [wasm-split](https://github.com/getsentry/symbolicator/tree/master/crates/wasm-split)
that can automatically add this section if missing and splits off
the debug information so it isn't sent to customers.

## Using wasm-split

Once your compiler has produced a `.wasm` file, you can use our [wasm-split](https://github.com/getsentry/symbolicator/tree/master/crates/wasm-split)
tool to add a `build_id` (if missing) and split the file into a debug information
file and a final stripped `.wasm` file without debug information:

```shell
wasm-split /path/to/file.wasm -d /path/to/file.debug.wasm --strip
```

This command modifies the `file.wasm` in place to add the `build_id`, then removes all
debug information. The debug information is put in a `file.debug.wasm` which
then needs to be uploaded to Sentry. For more information, see [Debug Information Files](/platforms/native/guides/wasm/data-management/debug-files/).

## Crash Reporting

If you want to have crash reporting in the browser, the recommended way with Sentry is to use
the `@sentry/wasm` package and apply its `wasmIntegration` to your `@sentry/browser` configuration.
This is [documented in detail](/platforms/javascript/guides/wasm/) in the JavaScript platform docs.

## Custom Crash Reports

It's likely that if you're working with WebAssembly, you want to send custom
crash reports; for example, if you don't execute WebAssembly in a browser, but in your
own runtime. In that case, you can follow the general protocol documentation which
also covers how to describe WebAssembly frames: [stack trace interface](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/data-model/event-payloads/stacktrace/).

Here is an example event for WebAssembly:

```javascript
{
  "platform": "native",
  "debug_meta": {
    "images": [
      {
        // the URL where the wasm file lives
        "code_file": "http://localhost:8002/demo.wasm",
        // indicates a web assembly module
        "type": "wasm",
        // the contents of the build_id section in hex,
        // truncated to 32 characters with a 0 appended
        "debug_id": "9e5cbc5553b44e8b9c69d18cdd7bfd2e0"
      }
    ]
  },
  "exception": {
    "values": [
      {
        "stacktrace": {
          "frames": [
            // wasm frame
            {
              "function": "wasm_func",
              "abs_path": "http://localhost:8002/demo.wasm",
              // the absolute offset in the wasm file for the instruction
              "instruction_addr": "0x8c",
              // indicates that the instruction_addr is relative to the 1st
              // module in the debug_info images list.
              "addr_mode": "rel:0"
            },
            // javascript frame
            {
              "function": "crash",
              "abs_path": "http://localhost:8002/index.html",
              "lineno": 24,
              "platform": "javascript"
            }
          ]
        },
        "type": "Error"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
