title: Application Crashes
description: Depending on the backend, the Native SDK can intercept application crashes and report minidumps to Sentry.
---

By default, the Native SDK intercepts crash signals and unhandled exceptions to
send crash reports to Sentry. Depending on the [backend](../../configuration/backends/), the
crash report can be sent as a conventional event or as a native crash report
file. On Windows, Linux, and macOS, the default backends send binary Minidump
files. Sentry processes them to extract stack traces and exception information
into a readable crash report.

For more information on Minidumps and the limits that apply, see
[What is a Minidump](/platforms/native/guides/minidumps/#what-is-a-minidump).

<Alert level="warning" title="Size Limits">

The size of Minidumps can vary between a few kilobytes and many megabytes.
Contributing factors are the number of threads, size of stack space, and the
number of heap memory regions referenced from the stack. As Minidumps often
contain large regions of empty memory, the SDK compresses Minidumps before
uploading. Sentry drops requests with a body larger than _20MB_, or if they
contain files larger than _100MB_.
