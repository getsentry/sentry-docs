description: Learn more about backends, extending the functionality of the Sentry SDK for crash reporting.
---

_Backends_ extend the functionality of the SDK for some common frameworks
and libraries. Similar to plugins, they extend the functionality of the Sentry
SDK.

The Native SDK can use different backends that are responsible for capturing
crashes. The backend is configured at build-time, using the `SENTRY_BACKEND`
CMake option, with support for the following options:

- [`crashpad`](crashpad/): This uses the out-of-process crashpad handler.
  It is used as the default on Windows, macOS and Linux.
- `breakpad`: This uses the in-process breakpad handler.
- `inproc`: A small in-process handler which is supported on all platforms,
  and is used as default on Android.
- `none`: This builds `sentry-native` without a backend, so it does not handle
  crashes at all. It is primarily used for tests.

`Breakpad` and `inproc` both run "in-process", so they run in the same process
as the application they capture crashes for. This means these backends can't
send a crash to Sentry immediately after it happens. Instead, the crash report is
written to disk and sent the next time the application is run. Since `Crashpad`
runs in a different process it doesn't have this limitation.
