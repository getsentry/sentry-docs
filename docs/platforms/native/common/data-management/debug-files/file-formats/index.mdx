Sentry differentiates four kinds of debug information:

- **Debug Information:** Provides function names, paths to source files, line
  numbers, and inline frames. The process of resolving this information from
  instruction addresses is called "symbolication". This information is
  relatively large compared to the executable and usually put into a separate
  file. In Sentry, these files are designated as _debug companions_ and show the
  `debug` tag.

- **Symbol Tables:** If debug information is not available for a certain
  library, Sentry can use symbol tables as a fallback to retrieve function
  names. Symbol tables are usually included in both the executable and debug
  companion files. However, they do not contain sufficient information to
  resolve inline functions or file names and line numbers. The `symtab` tag
  indicates symbol tables.

- **Source Code:** Conventionally, source code is not part of regular debug
  information files. Sentry CLI can bundle source code of your application and
  upload it to display source context in stack traces in Sentry. These bundles
  show up with the `sources` tag.

- **Unwind Information:** Enables Sentry to extract stack traces from Minidumps
  and other binary crash formats of optimized builds. This process is referred
  to as "stack unwinding" or "stack walking". Since this is also required when
  throwing exceptions in C++, this information is often included in the
  executable or library. If an uploaded file contains this information, it shows
  the `unwind` tag. Note that on some platforms no actual unwinding takes place.
  For instance, WebAssembly currently does not have the equivalent of minidumps
  which means we do not require that type of information in such cases.

Compilers place the above debug information in different files passed on the
target platform, architecture, build flags or optimization level. Consequently,
Sentry might not need all of the above information to process crash reports.
Still, it is always a good idea to provide all available debug information.

`sentry-cli` can be used to list properties of supported debug files and
validate their contents. See [_Debug Information Files in sentry-cli_](/product/cli/dif/) for more information.

## WASM

For WebAssembly, we support [DWARF in WASM containers](https://yurydelendik.github.io/webassembly-dwarf/).
Note that we do not support source maps, which are also a format used for WASM
debugging, but have shortcomings that make them impractical for a crash reporting
tool like Sentry.

Since WASM does not specify debug/build IDs yet, we provide a separate tool to
add build IDs and split files called [wasm-split](https://github.com/getsentry/symbolicator/blob/master/crates/wasm-split)
to help you create a debug companion file ready for uploading to Sentry
while removing all debug information from the release binary.
