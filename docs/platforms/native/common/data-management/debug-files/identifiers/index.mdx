Each debug information file specifies a unique identifier. Crash reports declare
these identifiers to allow debuggers and crash reporting systems to resolve the
correct files. Sentry distinguishes two kinds of identifiers:

- **Code Identifier**: The unique identifier of the executable or dynamic
  library -- the code file. The contents of this identifier are
  platform-dependent: Mach-O files use a UUID, ELF files a SHA hash, PE files use
  a concatenation of certain header attributes. For WebAssembly we use an
  embedded UUID in the `build_id` section of the file.

- **Debug Identifier**: The unique identifier of the debug companion file. In
  contrast to the code identifier, Sentry enforces the same structure on all
  platforms. On Windows, this is the actual unique id of the PDB file; on all
  other platforms this is a lossy transformation of the code identifier.

When uploading debug information files to Sentry, the CLI and server will always
compute a _Debug Identifier_ for each uploaded file. This identifier is
associated with executables and libraries as well as debug companions to ensure
that they can be uniquely located via one common mechanism.

<Note>

Debug information does not have to be associated with releases. The unique debug
identifier ensures that Sentry can choose the right files for every crash
report. However, it is still recommended to configure releases in the client to
benefit from other features.

</Note>

For native events, the issue details page displays a list of _Loaded Images_.
This list contains the executable and all loaded dynamic libraries including
their debug identifiers. You can copy this identifier and search for the exact
files that match it in the _Debug Files_ settings screen.

`sentry-cli` can help to print properties of debug information files like their
debug identifier. See [_Checking Debug Information Files_](/product/cli/dif/#checking-files) for more information.

## WASM Build IDs

WebAssembly does not yet support build IDs. The option proposed to
implement build IDs for WebAssembly ([Build ID Section for WASM](https://github.com/WebAssembly/tool-conventions/issues/133))
has not yet found widespread adoption. Instead, we use a custom
extension to WebAssembly.

Our recommendation is to embed a UUID in the `build_id` custom section as
raw binary. Our [`wasm-split`](https://github.com/getsentry/symbolicator/tree/master/crates/wasm-split)
tool can do this for you automatically.
