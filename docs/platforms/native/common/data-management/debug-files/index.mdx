Debug information files allow Sentry to extract stack traces and provide more
information about crash reports for most compiled platforms. Information stored
in debug files includes original function names, paths to source files and line
numbers, source code context, or the placement of variables in memory. Sentry
can use some of this information and display it on the issue details page.

<Note>

Source maps, while also being debug information files, are handled
differently in Sentry. For more information see [Source Maps in sentry-cli](/product/cli/releases/#sentry-cli-sourcemaps).

</Note>

Sentry requires access to debug information files of your application as well as
system libraries to provide fully symbolicated crash reports. You can either
[upload](./upload/) your files to Sentry or put them on a compatible
[Symbol Server](./symbol-servers/) to be downloaded by Sentry when needed.

## Managing Debug Information Files

After they have been uploaded, debug information files can be viewed and managed
from the _Debug Files_ section in the associated project's settings page. That page
lists all uploaded debug files, and also allows you to configure symbol servers
for automatic downloads.

From the [Project Details](/product/projects/project-details/) page, click into settings,
then click on _Debug Files_ in the page navigation.

<Note>

ProGuard files are listed separately, in the _ProGuard_ section of the project settings page.

</Note>

## Retention Policy

Debug Files have a retention period of _90 days_, using a _time to idle_ expiration mechanism.
This means that uploaded debug files are retained for as long as they are actively being used for event processing.
Once a debug file has not been used to process incoming events for at least 90 days,
it will automatically expire and be eligible for deletion.
