When an event is captured and sent to Sentry, SDKs will merge that event data with extra
information from the current scope. SDKs will typically automatically manage the scopes
for you in the framework integrations and you don't need to think about them. However,
you should know what a scope is and how you can use it for your advantage.

## What's a Scope, What's a Hub

You can think of the hub as the central point that our SDKs use to route an
event to Sentry. When you call `init()` a hub is created and a client and a
blank scope are created on it. That hub is then associated with the current
thread and will internally hold a stack of scopes.

The scope will hold useful information that should be sent along with the
event. For instance [contexts](../context/) or
[breadcrumbs](../breadcrumbs/) are stored on
the scope. When a scope is pushed, it inherits all data from the parent scope
and when it pops all modifications are reverted.

The default SDK integrations will push and pop scopes intelligently. For
instance web framework integrations will create and destroy scopes around your
routes or controllers.

## How the Scope and Hub Work

As you start using an SDK, a scope and hub are automatically created for you out
of the box. It's unlikely that you'll interact with the hub directly unless you're
writing an integration or you want to create or destroy scopes. Scopes, on the
other hand are more user facing. You can call <PlatformIdentifier name="configure-scope" /> at any point in
time to modify data stored on the scope. This is useful for doing things like
[modifying the context](../context/).

When you call a global function such as <PlatformIdentifier name="capture-event" /> internally Sentry
discovers the current hub and asks it to capture an event. Internally the hub will
then merge the event with the topmost scope's data.

<Alert level="warning" title="Hub Abstraction Is Not Implemented">

The Native SDK currently only provides a single scope shared by all threads in the program and maintains no thread-local state by way of a hub. Because of this limitation, you must make sure that your threads don't logically interfere with each other's changes to the global scope, even though they are safe to do so purely from a data-race perspective. This affects use cases where, for example, you want to track many users in server-like programs while capturing events or when you want to trace multiple threads in tracing.

For details on how this affects tracing, check out the [Connect Errors With Spans](/platforms/native/tracing/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation/#connect-errors-with-spans) section of "Custom Instrumentation".

## Configuring the Scope

The most useful operation when working with scopes is the <PlatformIdentifier name="configure-scope" /> function. It can be used to reconfigure the current scope.

You can, for instance, add custom tags or inform Sentry about the currently authenticated user.

<PlatformContent includePath="enriching-events/scopes/configure-scope" />

You can also apply this configuration when unsetting a user at logout:

<PlatformContent includePath="enriching-events/unset-user" />

To learn what useful information can be associated with scopes see
[the context documentation](../context/).
