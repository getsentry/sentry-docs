</Alert>

The `sentryfiber` middleware provides automatic tracing and error capturing for Fiber applications. The source can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/tree/master/fiber).

For installation and configuration instructions, see the [Fiber Getting Started](/platforms/go/guides/fiber/) guide.

## Automatic Instrumentation

<PlatformContent includePath="tracing/automatic-instrumentation/http-frameworks" />

## Adding Custom Spans

You can add custom child spans to track specific operations. See the <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation/">Custom Instrumentation</PlatformLink> documentation for details on manual span creation.

## Distributed Tracing

The `sentryfiber` middleware automatically continues traces from upstream services by reading Sentry trace headers from incoming requests. No additional configuration is needed.
