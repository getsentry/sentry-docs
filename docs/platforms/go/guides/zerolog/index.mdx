title: Zerolog
description: "Zerolog is a fast and efficient logging library for Go, designed for structured logging. This guide demonstrates how to integrate Zerolog with Sentry."

For a complete example, visit the [Go SDK source code repository](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/tree/master/_examples/zerolog).

[Go Dev-style API documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/zerolog) is also available.

## Install

<OnboardingOptionButtons
  options={[
    'error-monitoring',
  ]}
/>

```bash
go get github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/zerolog
```

<Break />

<SignInNote />

To integrate Sentry with Zerolog, you need to set up a custom writer that sends logs to Sentry based on the configured levels.


```go {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "12-16"}}
import (
	"errors"
	"time"
	"os"

	"github.com/getsentry/sentry-go"
	sentryzerolog "github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/zerolog"
	"github.com/rs/zerolog"
	"github.com/rs/zerolog/log"
)

func main() {
	// Initialize Sentry
	err := sentry.Init(sentry.ClientOptions{
		Dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
		BeforeSend: func(event *sentry.Event, hint *sentry.EventHint) *sentry.Event {
			// Modify or filter events before sending them to Sentry
			return event
		},
		Debug:            true,
		AttachStacktrace: true,
	})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal().Err(err).Msg("sentry initialization failed")
	}
	defer sentry.Flush(2 * time.Second)

	// Configure Zerolog to use Sentry as a writer
	sentryWriter, err := sentryzerolog.New(sentryzerolog.Config{
		ClientOptions: sentry.ClientOptions{
			Dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
		},
		Options: sentryzerolog.Options{
			Levels:          []zerolog.Level{zerolog.ErrorLevel, zerolog.FatalLevel, zerolog.PanicLevel},
			WithBreadcrumbs: true,
			FlushTimeout:    3 * time.Second,
		},
	})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal().Err(err).Msg("failed to create sentry writer")
	}
	defer sentryWriter.Close()

	// Use Sentry writer in Zerolog
	log.Logger = log.Output(zerolog.MultiLevelWriter(zerolog.ConsoleWriter{Out: os.Stderr}, sentryWriter))

	// Log an InfoLevel entry to STDERR (not sent to Sentry)
	log.Info().Msg("Application has started")

	// Log an ErrorLevel entry to STDERR and Sentry
	log.Error().Msg("oh no!")

	// Log a FatalLevel entry to STDERR, send to Sentry, and terminate the application
	log.Fatal().Err(errors.New("can't continue")).Msg("fatal error occurred")
}
```

## Configure

sentryzerolog provides options to configure the integration with Sentry. It expects a `sentryzerolog.Config` that has `sentry.ClientOptions` and `sentryzerolog.Options`. The `sentry.ClientOptions` are used to initialize the Sentry client, and the `sentryzerolog.Options` are used to configure the Zerolog integration.

The sentryzerolog.Options struct has the following fields:


```go
// Levels specifies the log levels that will trigger event sending to Sentry.
// Only log messages at these levels will be sent. By default, the levels are
// Error, Fatal, and Panic.
Levels []zerolog.Level

// WithBreadcrumbs, when enabled, adds log entries as breadcrumbs in Sentry.
// Breadcrumbs provide a trail of events leading up to an error, which can
// be invaluable for understanding the context of issues.
WithBreadcrumbs bool

// FlushTimeout sets the maximum duration allowed for flushing events to Sentry.
// This is the time limit within which all pending events must be sent to Sentry
// before the application exits. A typical use is ensuring all logs are sent before
// application shutdown. The default timeout is usually 3 seconds.
FlushTimeout time.Duration
```

## Usage

Use Zerolog as you normally would, and it will automatically send logs at or above the specified levels to Sentry.

Note: Ensure Sentry is flushed before the application exits to avoid losing any pending events.
