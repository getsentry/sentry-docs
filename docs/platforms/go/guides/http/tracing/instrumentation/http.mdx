To capture transactions, you'll need to first <PlatformLink to="/tracing/">set up tracing</PlatformLink>.

</Alert>

The `sentryhttp` middleware provides automatic tracing and error capturing for applications using Go's standard `net/http` package. The source can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/tree/master/http).

For installation and configuration instructions, see the [net/http Getting Started](/platforms/go/guides/http/) guide.

## Automatic Instrumentation

## Adding Custom Spans

You can add custom child spans to track specific operations within your handlers. See the <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation/">Custom Instrumentation</PlatformLink> documentation for details on manual span creation.

## Distributed Tracing

The `sentryhttp` middleware automatically continues traces from upstream services by reading Sentry trace headers from incoming requests. No additional configuration is needed.

For outbound HTTP requests with tracing, see the <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation/requests-module/">HTTP Requests</PlatformLink> documentation.
