Sentry offers a [requests monitoring dashboard](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/insights/backend/http/) that can be auto-instrumented by our Go SDK.

If you're not using the net/http client, you can manually instrument your requests and use Sentry to get a look into how your requests to APIs are performing by following the setup instructions below.

<Alert>
Make sure that there's a transaction running when you create the spans. See <PlatformLink to="/tracing/">Tracing</PlatformLink> for more information.

## Automatic instrumentation

The `sentryhttpclient` package enables automatic propagation of the tracing headers (`sentry-trace` and `sentry-baggage`) and span instrumentation for outbound HTTP requests. Here is an example of using the default http client:

```go
import sentryhttpclient "github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/httpclient"

func main() {
  // need to have tracing enabled
  _ = sentry.Init(sentry.ClientOptions{
  	Dsn:           "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  	EnableTracing:    true,
  	TracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  })

  client := sentryhttpclient.SentryHTTPClient
  response, err := client.Do(request)
  if err != nil {
  	return
  }
  fmt.Println(response)
}
```

## Custom HTTP client

If you need to use your custom HTTP client, all you need to do is use the `SentryRoundTripper`. This gives you control over the transport while retaining Sentry integration:

```go
import sentryhttpclient "github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/httpclient"

customClient := &http.Client{
  Transport: sentryhttpclient.NewSentryRoundTripper(nil),
}
resp, err := customClient.Do(req)
```

Passing nil to `NewSentryRoundTripper` defaults to `http.DefaultTransport`, but you can provide a custom RoundTripper if needed.

## Using a RoundTripper with trace propagation targets

You can further control when sentry tracing headers are attached by using `WithTracePropagationTargets`, which limits propagation to specific URLs (string match, no regex):

```go
import sentryhttpclient "github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/httpclient"

roundTripper := sentryhttpclient.NewSentryRoundTripper(
  http.DefaultTransport,
  sentryhttpclient.WithTracePropagationTargets([]string{"internal.service.local", "api.example.com"}),
)

client := &http.Client{
	Transport: roundTripper,
}

resp, err := client.Do(req)
```

This setup ensures tracing headers are only added to requests targeting the specified hosts, helping prevent leakage of tracing data to third-party services.

## Wrap HTTP Requests in a Span

<Alert>

Refer to [HTTP Span Data Conventions](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/performance/span-data-conventions/#http) for a full list of the span data attributes.

</Alert>

Here is how to manually instrument HTTP requests:

```go
var span sentry.Span
parentSpan := sentry.SpanFromContext(ctx)
if parentSpan != nil {
  span = *parentSpan.StartChild("http.client", sentry.WithTransactionName("transaction-name"), sentry.WithDescription("description"))
}
client := &http.Client{}
resp, err := client.Get("https://example.com")
if err != nil {
  return
}
span.SetData("http.query", "GET https://example.com/")
span.SetData("http.request.method", "GET")
span.SetData("http.response.status_code", resp.StatusCode)
span.SetData("http.response_content_length", resp.ContentLength)
```
