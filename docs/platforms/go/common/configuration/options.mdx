SDKs are configurable using a variety of options. The options are largely standardized among SDKs, but there are some differences to better accommodate platform peculiarities. Options are set when the SDK is first
initialized.

<PlatformContent includePath="configuration/config-intro" />

```go
// ClientOptions that configures a SDK Client
type ClientOptions struct {
	// The DSN to use. If the DSN is not set, the client is effectively
	// disabled.
	Dsn string
	// In debug mode, the debug information is printed to stdout to help you
	// understand what Sentry is doing.
	Debug bool
	// Configures whether SDK should generate and attach stack traces to pure
	// capture message calls.
	AttachStacktrace bool
	// The sample rate for event submission in the range [0.0, 1.0]. By default,
	// all events are sent. Thus, as a historical special case, the sample rate
	// 0.0 is treated as if it was 1.0. To drop all events, set the DSN to the
	// empty string.
	SampleRate float64
	// Enable performance tracing.
	EnableTracing bool
	// The sample rate for sampling traces in the range [0.0, 1.0].
	TracesSampleRate float64
	// Used to customize the sampling of traces, overrides TracesSampleRate.
	TracesSampler TracesSampler
	// The sample rate for profiling traces in the range [0.0, 1.0].
	// This is relative to TracesSampleRate - it is a ratio of profiled traces out of all sampled traces.
	ProfilesSampleRate float64
	// List of regexp strings that will be used to match against event's message
	// and if applicable, caught errors type and value.
	// If the match is found, then a whole event will be dropped.
	IgnoreErrors []string
	// List of regexp strings that will be used to match against a transaction's
	// name. If a match is found, then the transaction  will be dropped.
	IgnoreTransactions []string
	// If this flag is enabled, certain personally identifiable information (PII) is added by active integrations.
	// By default, no such data is sent.
	SendDefaultPII bool
	// BeforeSend is called before error events are sent to Sentry.
	// Use it to mutate the event or return nil to discard the event.
	BeforeSend func(event *Event, hint *EventHint) *Event
	// BeforeSendTransaction is called before transaction events are sent to Sentry.
	// Use it to mutate the transaction or return nil to discard the transaction.
	BeforeSendTransaction func(event *Event, hint *EventHint) *Event
	// Before breadcrumb add callback.
	BeforeBreadcrumb func(breadcrumb *Breadcrumb, hint *BreadcrumbHint) *Breadcrumb
	// Integrations to be installed on the current Client, receives default
	// integrations.
	Integrations func([]Integration) []Integration
	// io.Writer implementation that should be used with the Debug mode.
	DebugWriter io.Writer
	// The transport to use. Defaults to HTTPTransport.
	Transport Transport
	// The server name to be reported.
	ServerName string
	// The release to be sent with events.
	//
	// Some Sentry features are built around releases, and, thus, reporting
	// events with a non-empty release improves the product experience. See
	// https://docs.sentry.io/product/releases/.
	//
	// If Release is not set, the SDK will try to derive a default value
	// from environment variables or the Git repository in the working
	// directory.
	//
	// If you distribute a compiled binary, it is recommended to set the
	// Release value explicitly at build time. As an example, you can use:
	//
	// 	go build -ldflags='-X main.release=VALUE'
	//
	// That will set the value of a predeclared variable 'release' in the
	// 'main' package to 'VALUE'. Then, use that variable when initializing
	// the SDK:
	//
	// 	sentry.Init(ClientOptions{Release: release})
	//
	// See https://golang.org/cmd/go/ and https://golang.org/cmd/link/ for
	// the official documentation of -ldflags and -X, respectively.
	Release string
	// The dist to be sent with events.
	Dist string
	// The environment to be sent with events.
	Environment string
	// Maximum number of breadcrumbs
	// when MaxBreadcrumbs is negative then ignore breadcrumbs.
	MaxBreadcrumbs int
	// Maximum number of spans.
	//
	// See https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/data-model/envelopes/#size-limits for size limits
	// applied during event ingestion. Events that exceed these limits might get dropped.
	MaxSpans int
	// An optional pointer to http.Client that will be used with a default
	// HTTPTransport. Using your own client will make HTTPTransport, HTTPProxy,
	// HTTPSProxy and CaCerts options ignored.
	HTTPClient *http.Client
	// An optional pointer to http.Transport that will be used with a default
	// HTTPTransport. Using your own transport will make HTTPProxy, HTTPSProxy
	// and CaCerts options ignored.
	HTTPTransport http.RoundTripper
	// An optional HTTP proxy to use.
	// This will default to the HTTP_PROXY environment variable.
	HTTPProxy string
	// An optional HTTPS proxy to use.
	// This will default to the HTTPS_PROXY environment variable.
	// HTTPS_PROXY takes precedence over HTTP_PROXY for https requests.
	HTTPSProxy string
	// An optional set of SSL certificates to use.
	CaCerts *x509.CertPool
	// MaxErrorDepth is the maximum number of errors reported in a chain of errors.
	// This protects the SDK from an arbitrarily long chain of wrapped errors.
	//
	// An additional consideration is that arguably reporting a long chain of errors
	// is of little use when debugging production errors with Sentry. The Sentry UI
	// is not optimized for long chains either. The top-level error together with a
	// stack trace is often the most useful information.
	MaxErrorDepth int
}
```

### Providing SSL Certificates

By default, TLS uses the host's root CA set. If you don't have `ca-certificates` (which should be your go-to way of fixing the issue of the missing certificates) and want to use `gocertifi` instead, you can provide pre-loaded cert files as one of the options to the `sentry.Init` call:


```go
package main

import (
	"log"

	"github.com/certifi/gocertifi"
	"github.com/getsentry/sentry-go"
)

sentryClientOptions := sentry.ClientOptions{
	Dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
}

rootCAs, err := gocertifi.CACerts()
if err != nil {
	log.Println("Could not load CA Certificates: %v\n", err)
} else {
	sentryClientOptions.CaCerts = rootCAs
}

sentry.Init(sentryClientOptions)
```

### Removing Default Integrations

`sentry-go` SDK has few built-in integrations that enhance events with additional information, or manage them in one way or another.

If you want to read more about them, see the [source code](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/blob/master/integrations.go) directly.

However, there are some cases where you may want to disable some of them. To do this, you can use the `Integrations` configuration option and filter unwanted integrations. For example:

```go
sentry.Init(sentry.ClientOptions{
	// ...
	Integrations: func(integrations []sentry.Integration) []sentry.Integration {
		var filteredIntegrations []sentry.Integration
		for _, integration := range integrations {
			if integration.Name() == "ContextifyFrames" {
				continue
			}
			filteredIntegrations = append(filteredIntegrations, integration)
		}
		return filteredIntegrations
	},
})
```
