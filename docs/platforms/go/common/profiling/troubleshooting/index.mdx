If you don't see any profiling data in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io), you can try the following:

- Ensure that <PlatformLink to="/tracing/">Tracing is enabled</PlatformLink>.
- Ensure that the automatic instrumentation is sending performance data to Sentry by going to the **Performance** page in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).
- If the automatic instrumentation is not sending performance data, try using <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation">custom instrumentation</PlatformLink>.
- Enable <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#debug">debug mode</PlatformLink> in the SDK and check the logs.

### Limitations

Profile samples are collected periodically for each goroutine.
If your program uses a large number of concurrent goroutines, make sure to check whether the overhead is within the acceptable range for your use case.

As always, and especially with Profiling in Go being an alpha feature, feedback is welcome on [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/621778831602221064/621786587939864586) or [GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/issues/630).
