## Enable Profiling


To enable profiling, set the `ProfilesSampleRate`:

<SignInNote />

```go {diff}
err := sentry.Init(sentry.ClientOptions{
    Dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    EnableTracing: true,
    TracesSampleRate: 1.0,
+   ProfilesSampleRate: 1.0,
})
```

<Note>

The `ProfilesSampleRate` setting is _relative_ to the `TracesSampleRate` setting.

For Profiling to work, you have to first enable Sentry’s performance monitoring via `TracesSampleRate` (like in the example above). Read our <PlatformLink to="/performance/">tracing setup documentation</PlatformLink> to learn how to configure sampling. If you set your sample rate to 1.0, all transactions will be captured.
