## Enable Profiling

<Note>

Go Profiling alpha is available since SDK version `0.22.0`.

</Note>

To enable profiling, set the `ProfilesSampleRate`:

<SignInNote />

```go
err := sentry.Init(sentry.ClientOptions{
	Dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
	EnableTracing: true,
	TracesSampleRate: 1.0,
	ProfilesSampleRate: 1.0,
})
```

<Note>

The <PlatformIdentifier name="profiles_sample_rate" /> setting is _relative_ to the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces_sample_rate" /> setting.

For Profiling to work, you have to first enable Sentryâ€™s performance monitoring via `traces_sample_rate` (like in the example above). Read our <PlatformLink to="/performance/">performance setup documentation</PlatformLink> to learn how to configure sampling. If you set your sample rate to 1.0, all transactions will be captured.
