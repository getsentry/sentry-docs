Sentry takes data privacy very seriously and has default settings in place that prioritize data safety, especially when it comes to personally identifiable information (PII) data. When you add the Sentry SDK to your application, you allow it to collect data and send it to Sentry during the runtime of your application.

The category types and amount of data collected vary, depending on the integrations you've enabled in the Sentry SDK. This page lists data categories that the Sentry Go SDK collects.

For many of the categories listed here it is required to enable the <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options">SendDefaultPII option</PlatformLink>.

## HTTP Headers

By default, the Sentry SDK doesn't send any HTTP headers. Even when sending HTTP headers is enabled, we have a [denylist](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-go/blob/master/interfaces.go#L157-163) in place, which filters out any headers that contain sensitive data.

To start sending HTTP headers, set <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options">SendDefaultPII option</PlatformLink> to true.

## Cookies

By default, the Sentry SDK doesn't send cookies. Sentry tries to remove any cookies that contain sensitive information, such as the Session ID and CSRF Token cookies.

If you want to send cookies, set <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options">SendDefaultPII option</PlatformLink> to true.

## Users' IP Addresses

By default, the Sentry SDK doesn't send the user's IP address. Once enabled, the Sentry backend services will infer the user ip address based on the incoming request, unless certain integrations you can enable override this behavior.

To enable sending the user's IP address, set <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options">SendDefaultPII option</PlatformLink> to true.

## Request URL

The full request URL of incoming HTTP requests is **always sent to Sentry**. Depending on your application, this could contain PII data.

## Request Query String

The full request query string of incoming HTTP requests is **always sent to Sentry**. Depending on your application, this could contain PII data.
