## Using with Game Engines

If you're using Unity or Unreal Engine, use the game engine SDK instead of integrating the Nintendo Switch SDK directly. The game engine SDKs wrap the Nintendo Switch SDK and provide engine-specific features:

- [Unity SDK for Nintendo Switch](/platforms/unity/game-consoles/) - captures C# exceptions and syncs context with native crashes
- [Unreal Engine SDK for Nintendo Switch](/platforms/unreal/game-consoles/) - provides C++ and Blueprint APIs on top of the Nintendo Switch SDK

For custom engines or native C++ games, integrate the Nintendo Switch SDK directly as described above.
