To get started using Sentry in your Nintendo Switch games, you can go to [CRPORTAL](https://crash-report.wc.lp1.er.srv.nintendo.net/sentry/get_started).
There you can configure Nintendo's servers to start forwarding your crashes to Sentry.

You can use your current Sentry organization, or use a Nintendo
[Sponsored Plan](https://crash-report.wc.lp1.er.srv.nintendo.net/sentry/docs/subscription) which is free of charge.

Details on configuring symbol servers are also found [in the documentation in the portal](https://crash-report.wc.lp1.er.srv.nintendo.net/sentry/docs).

To get additional support from Sentry, you can
[reach out via the middleware page](https://developer.nintendo.com/group/development/getting-started/g1kr9vj6/middleware/sentry).
Or write directly inside the Nintendo Developer Portal's [forum specific for Sentry](https://developer.nintendo.com/group/development/g1kr9vj6/forums/english/-/gts_message_boards/category/333894267).
