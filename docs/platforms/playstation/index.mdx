No changes to the game are required, Sentry will pull crashes and additional data such as screenshots automatically.
Support for both devkit as well as retail devices are available.

To start using Sentry in your PS5 games, you can head over to the [Sentry page inside PlayStation Partners](https://game.develop.playstation.net/tm/verify/functionalsw) and confirm your developer status by clicking on *Confirm status*.

We'll receive your request and get back to you with the next steps.
