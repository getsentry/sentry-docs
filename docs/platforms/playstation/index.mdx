You can also use Sentry's [Unity](/platforms/unity/game-consoles/) and [Unreal Engine SDKs](/platforms/unreal/game-consoles/) with PlayStation.

<Alert level="info" title="Availabilty of PlayStation support">
PlayStation support is exclusive to our SaaS offering, as it depends on confidential components that cannot be distributed for self-hosted use.

Access to Sentry's error and crash reporting for consoles is a paid feature. We will review the pricing and details with you during the verification process.
