<Alert level="info" title="Availability of PlayStation support">
PlayStation support is exclusive to our SaaS offering, as it depends on confidential components that cannot be distributed for self-hosted use.

Access to Sentry's error and crash reporting for consoles is a paid feature. We will review the pricing and details with you during the verification process.
