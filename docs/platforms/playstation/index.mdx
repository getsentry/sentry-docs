## Using with Game Engines

If you're using Unity or Unreal Engine, use the game engine SDK instead of integrating the PlayStation SDK directly. The game engine SDKs wrap the PlayStation SDK and provide engine-specific features:

- [Unity SDK for PlayStation](/platforms/unity/game-consoles/) - captures C# exceptions and syncs context with native crashes
- [Unreal Engine SDK for PlayStation](/platforms/unreal/game-consoles/) - provides C++ and Blueprint APIs on top of the PlayStation SDK

For custom engines or native C++ games, integrate the PlayStation SDK directly as described above.

<Alert level="info" title="Availability of PlayStation support">
PlayStation support is exclusive to our SaaS offering, as it depends on confidential components that cannot be distributed for self-hosted use.

Access to Sentry's error and crash reporting for consoles is a paid feature. We will review the pricing and details with you during the verification process.
