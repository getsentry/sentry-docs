If you don't see any profiling data in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io), you can try the following:

- Ensure that <PlatformLink to="/tracing/">Tracing is enabled</PlatformLink>.
- Ensure that the automatic instrumentation is sending performance data to Sentry by going to the **Performance** page in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).
- If the automatic instrumentation is not sending performance data, try using <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation">custom instrumentation</PlatformLink>.
- Enable <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#debug">debug mode</PlatformLink> in the SDK and check the logs.

### Limitations

Profiles for multi-threaded servers like `puma` might not capture frames correctly when async I/O is happening. This is a limitation of `stackprof`.
