## Features

In addition to capturing errors, you can monitor interactions between multiple services or applications by [enabling tracing](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/). You can also collect and analyze performance profiles from real users with [profiling](/product/explore/profiling/).

## Configure

Configuration should happen as early as possible in your application's lifecycle.

## Verify

This snippet includes an intentional error, so you can test that everything is working as soon as you set it up.
