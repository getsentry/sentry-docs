The Sentry SDK uses integrations to hook into the functionality of popular frameworks and libraries to automatically instrument your application and give you the best data out of the box.

Some of our integrations are available as separate gems while others are available as patches that can be enabled from the `sentry-ruby` gem. You can find an overview of all available integrations below.

## Gems

The following table lists all integrations available as gems.

Simply add the relevant gems to your Gemfile and run `bundle install` to install them.

## Patches

The following table lists all integrations available as patches and which ones are enabled by default.

You can use [`config.enabled_patches`](/platforms/ruby/configuration/options/#enabled-patches) to enable or disable them.

```ruby
# enable :faraday patch
config.enabled_patches << :faraday

# disable :puma patch
config.enabled_patches.delete(:puma)
```

|                     Patch   | **Auto-enabled** |
| ----------------------------|:----------------:|
| `:http`                     |       ✓          |
| `:redis`                    |       ✓          |
| `:puma`                     |       ✓          |
| `:faraday`                  |                  |
| `:graphql`                  |                  |

## Features

### Rails

The Rails integration is a feature rich integration that:

* captures Errors anywhere in your Rails application
* creates Transactions for incoming HTTP Requests
* records Spans in those Transactions for various important operations like:
  * database queries (performed with `activerecord`)
  * view renders

### Queues

The various Queue integrations for Sidekiq, Delayed Job and Resque create distributed traces connecting tasks that are performed in the background asynchronously.

The Rails integration also includes this functionality for `ActiveJob`.

### OpenTelemetry

The OpenTelemetry integration is used for exporting spans instrumented by an OpenTelemetry SDK into Sentry. See the [OpenTelemetry Setup](/platforms/ruby/tracing/instrumentation/opentelemetry) instructions for more details.

### HTTP Requests

Outgoing HTTP Requests are instrumented as Spans by the `:http` (for requests done with `Net::HTTP`) and `:faraday` patches.

### GraphQL

GraphQL operations are instrumented as Spans by the `:graphql` patch.

### Puma

The `:puma` patch captures low level exceptions outside your application stack.
