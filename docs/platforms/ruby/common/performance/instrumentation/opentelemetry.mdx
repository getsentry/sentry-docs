You can configure your [OpenTelemetry SDK](https://opentelemetry.io/) to send traces and spans to Sentry.

## Install

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/opentelemetry-install" />

## Usage

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/opentelemetry-setup" />

## OpenTelemetry and Sentry

With Sentryâ€™s OpenTelemetry SDK, an OpenTelemetry `Span` becomes a Sentry `Transaction` or `Span`. The first `Span` sent through the Sentry `SpanProcessor` is a `Transaction`, and any child `Span` gets attached to the first `Transaction` upon checking the parent `Span` context. This is true for the OpenTelemetry root `Span` and any top level `Span` in the system. For example, a request sent from frontend to backend will create an OpenTelemetry root `Span` with a corresponding Sentry `Transaction`. The backend request will create a new Sentry `Transaction` for the OpenTelemetry `Span`. The Sentry `Transaction` and `Span` are linked as a trace for navigation and error tracking purposes.

## Additional Configuration

If you need more fine grained control over Sentry, take a look at the <PlatformLink to="/configuration/">Configuration page</PlatformLink>. In case you'd like to filter out transactions before sending them to Sentry (to get rid of health checks, for example), you may find the <PlatformLink to="/configuration/filtering/#filtering-transaction-events">Filtering page</PlatformLink> helpful.
