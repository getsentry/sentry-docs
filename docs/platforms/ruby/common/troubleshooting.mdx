## General

<Expandable title="Why was my tag value truncated?">

  Currently, every tag has a maximum character limit of 200 characters. Tags over the 200 character limit will become truncated, losing potentially important information. To retain this data, you can split data over several tags instead.

  For example, a 200+ character tagged request:

  `https://empowerplant.io/api/0/projects/ep/setup_form/?user_id=314159265358979323846264338327&tracking_id=EasyAsABC123OrSimpleAsDoReMi&product_name=PlantToHumanTranslator&product_id=161803398874989484820458683436563811772030917980576`

  The 200+ character request above will become truncated to:

  `https://empowerplant.io/api/0/projects/ep/setup_form/?user_id=314159265358979323846264338327&tracking_id=EasyAsABC123OrSimpleAsDoReMi&product_name=PlantToHumanTranslator&product_id=1618033988749894848`

## Profiling

<Expandable title="Why am I not seeing any profiling data?">

  If you don't see any profiling data in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io), you can try the following:

  - Ensure that <PlatformLink to="/tracing/">Tracing is enabled</PlatformLink>.
  - Ensure that the automatic instrumentation is sending performance data to Sentry by going to the **Performance** page
  in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).
  - If the automatic instrumentation is not sending performance data, try using <PlatformLink
  to="/tracing/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation">custom instrumentation</PlatformLink>.
  - Enable <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#debug">debug mode</PlatformLink> in the SDK and check the logs.

  ### Limitations

  Profiles for multi-threaded servers like `puma` might not capture frames correctly when async I/O is happening. This
  is a limitation of `stackprof`.
