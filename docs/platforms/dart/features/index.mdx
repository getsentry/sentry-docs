<Note>

Sentry's Dart SDK enables automatic reporting of errors, messages, and exceptions. The SDK is available on GitHub [`sentry-dart`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dart/). For Flutter apps, refer to [our Flutter documentation](/platforms/flutter) instead.

</Note>

**Features:**

- Breadcrumbs automatically captured:
  - by the [Dart SDK](/platforms/dart/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/#automatic-breadcrumbs)
  - by the [Logging Integration](/platforms/dart/integrations/logging)
  - by the [Dio Integration](/platforms/dart/integrations/dio/)
- [Attachments](/platforms/dart/enriching-events/attachments/) enrich your event by storing additional files, such as config or log files.
- [User Feedback](/platforms/dart/user-feedback/) provides the ability to collect user information when an event occurs.
- [Performance Monitoring](/product/performance/) creates transactions for:
  - [HTTP requests](/platforms/dart/integrations/http-integration/#performance-monitoring-for-http-requests)
  - [Dio HTTP library](/platforms/dart/integrations/dio/#performance-monitoring-for-http-requests)
