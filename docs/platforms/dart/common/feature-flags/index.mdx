description: With Feature Flags, Sentry tracks feature flag evaluations in your application, keeps an audit log of feature flag changes, and reports any suspicious updates that may have caused an error.

## Prerequisites

- [Sentry SDK](/platforms/dart/#configure) version `9.0.0`.

## Enable Evaluation Tracking

If you use a third-party SDK to evaluate feature flags, you can enable Sentry to track those evaluations. Integrations are provider specific, and documentation for supported SDKs is listed below:

- [Firebase Remote Config](/platforms/dart/configuration/integrations/firebase-remote-config/)

### Manual Usage

Call `Sentry.addFeatureFlag` to track feature flag evaluations:

```dart
Sentry.addFeatureFlag("feature_flag_a", true);
```

Calling this function multiple times with the same flag name will override the previous value.
