This section provides guidance on how to manually integrate Sentry into your Dart applications.

## Flutter

To learn how to set up Sentry in your Flutter application, see [Flutter Setup](/platforms/dart/guides/flutter/).

## Pure Dart Projects

Sentry supports Dart applications beyond just Flutter. To learn how to set up Sentry in your pure Dart projects, refer to the [installation documentation](/platforms/dart/#install).

## Debug Symbols

To get readable stack traces for your errors, you'll need to provide Sentry with debug symbols:

- **[Learn about Debug Symbols](/platforms/dart/common/debug-symbols/)** - Understand what debug symbols are and how they help.
  
- **[Sentry Dart Plugin](/platforms/dart/common/debug-symbols/dart-plugin/)** - Use the automated solution for uploading debug symbols.

- **[Manual Upload](/platforms/dart/common/debug-symbols/manual-upload/)** - Upload debug symbols manually for different platforms.
