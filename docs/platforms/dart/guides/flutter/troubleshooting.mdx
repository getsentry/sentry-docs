If you need help solving issues with Sentry's Flutter SDK, you can read the edge cases documented here. If you need additional help, you can [ask on GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dart/issues/new/choose). Customers on a paid plan may also contact support.

## Support 16 KB Page Sizes on Android

Starting with Android 15, AOSP supports devices with a 16 KB page size. If your app uses NDK libraries (directly or via an SDK), you’ll need to rebuild it for compatibility with these devices.

Update to Sentry Flutter SDK version `8.11.0` and above order to support 16 KB page sizes on Android devices. 

Please read the [Android developer documentation](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/page-sizes) to update and test your app with 16 KB page size support.

## "Missing API declaration" after App Store review

Starting May 1, 2024, Apple requires all apps submitted to the App Store to provide a list of privacy-related APIs they use, including the reasons under which they use it. If you received an email from Apple with the message "ITMS-91053: Missing API declaration", your app doesn't fulfill the requirements. To solve this, follow our [Apple Privacy Manifest](/platforms/dart/guides/flutter/data-management/apple-privacy-manifest) guide.

## Known Limitations

- If you enable the `split-debug-info` and `obfuscate` features, you must upload [debug symbols](/platforms/dart/guides/flutter/upload-debug/).
- Issue titles might be obfuscated as we rely on the `runtimeType`, but they may not be human-readable. See the [Obfuscate Caveat](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/obfuscate#caveat).
- Layout related errors are only caught by [FlutterError.onError](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/foundation/FlutterError/onError.html) in debug mode. In release mode, they are removed by the Flutter framework. See [Flutter build modes](https://flutter.dev/docs/testing/build-modes).
- Use [inbound filters](/concepts/data-management/filtering/) to exclude unhandled errors that are caught outside of your application in release builds. The SDK cannot filter these directly due to obfuscated stack traces.
- If your app runs on Windows and uses a Flutter version below `3.3.0`, you need to set the version and build number manually, see [this issue on GitHub](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/73652). To do so:
  - Use Dart defines to build the app: `flutter build windows --dart-define=SENTRY_RELEASE=my_app@1.0.0+1`
  - Or, set the release on SentryOptions `options.release = 'my_app@1.0.0+1'` during SDK initialization.

## Building Specific ABI on Android

The Sentry Flutter SDK includes the Sentry Android SDK, which bundles multiple native libraries for multiple ABIs.
Building a Flutter app for a specific ABI using the `--target-platform` argument, for example an ARM 32bit apk, looks like this, which should also include the `--split-per-abi` flag:

```bash
flutter build apk --target-platform=android-arm --split-per-abi
```

## Running Sentry Within an Isolate

If you have a Sentry instance running within a separate [Isolate](https://dart.dev/language/isolates) you must execute `Sentry.close()` before the Isolate completes, otherwise the Isolate won't shut down correctly.

## Native Symbolication on Android

The configuration for symbolication of Native events (C/C++) is documented in our [Android Native Development Kit](/platforms/android/configuration/using-ndk/) content. If you are having issues with symbolication in Flutter, check that your configuration is correct, as discussed in our Flutter content that covers [Uploading for Android NDK](/platforms/dart/guides/flutter/upload-debug/#uploading-for-android-ndk)

## Native Symbolication on iOS/macOS

Flutter `split-debug-info` and `obfuscate` flags are supported on iOS/macOS. They require compiling your app using Flutter, version `3.7.0` and above and the Sentry Flutter SDK, version `6.10.0` and above.

## Source Context

Source Context support requires compiling your app using the `split-debug-info` build parameter on Flutter `3.10.0` and above. You must also upload [debug symbols](/platforms/dart/guides/flutter/upload-debug/) with the `upload_sources` option enabled.

## Sentry Dart Plugin

If you are using the Sentry Dart Plugin to upload [Debug Symbols](/platforms/dart/guides/flutter/upload-debug/#automatically-upload-debug-symbols), refer to the points below to resolve potential issues.

A Sentry `auth_token` can be generated at the [Organization Auth Tokens ](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/settings/auth-tokens/) settings page.

Dart's `--obfuscate` option is required to be paired with `--split-debug-info` to generate a symbol map. See [Dart docs](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Obfuscating-Dart-Code) for more information.

The `--split-debug-info` option requires setting an output directory. The directory must be an inner folder of the project's folder. See [Flutter docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/obfuscate#obfuscate-your-app) for more information.

Flutter's `build web` command requires setting the `--source-maps` parameter to generate source maps. See [Flutter GitHub Issue](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/72150#issuecomment-755541599) for more information.

## Screenshot Integration Background Crash

There is an [issue with the Sentry Flutter SDK](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dart/issues/1669) where apps can crash if taking screenshots in the background.

This is an [issue](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/135245) with Flutter itself and should be fixed in [Flutter 3.15](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/labels/found%20in%20release%3A%203.15).

For prior versions, you can work around this by configuring the SDK only to take screenshots when the app is in the `resumed` state. To do this, set `SentryFlutterOptions.attachScreenshotOnlyWhenResumed` to `true`.

## Using Flutter Multi-view for Web

Multi-view embedding was introduced in Flutter 3.24. You'll find a detailed guide about it in the [Flutter docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/embedding-flutter-web) .

Using Sentry in a multi-view application is possible, but there are some limitations you should be aware of.
The following features don't currently support multi-view:

- Screenshots via the `SentryScreenshotWidget` (which is part of the `SentryWidget`)
- User interaction integration via the `SentryUserInteractionWidget` (which is part of the `SentryWidget`)
- Window and Device events via the `WidgetsBindingIntegration`

To prevent the `WidgetsBindingIntegration` from loading by default, you'll need to remove the integration as shown below:

```dart
// ignore: implementation_imports
import 'package:sentry_flutter/src/integrations/widgets_binding_integration.dart';
...
SentryFlutter.init(
  (options) {
    ...
    final integration = options.integrations
        .firstWhere((element) => element is WidgetsBindingIntegration);
    options.removeIntegration(integration);
  },
  // Init your App.
  appRunner: appRunner,
);
```

### Example Application

Copy the `main.dart` file into the `lib` folder of your existing project. This file already contains the code of the `multi_view_app.dart` from the [`flutter documentation`](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/embedding-flutter-web#handling-view-changes-from-dart).
Next, copy the `flutter_bootstrap.js` file and the `index.html` file into the `web` folder.

Make sure you're using **Flutter 3.24** or newer and run the application.

Now you should be able to see **two** instances of the same application side by side, with different **ViewIds** in the `body`.
