Debug symbols are essential for understanding stack traces in your Flutter application when errors occur. Without debug symbols, stack traces from minified or obfuscated code can be difficult or impossible to interpret.

## What Are Debug Symbols?

Debug symbols provide the necessary information to convert program addresses back to function names, source file names, and line numbers. When you build a Flutter application, especially with obfuscation or optimization enabled, this information is typically removed from the main application bundle to reduce size.

## When to Upload Debug Symbols

With default settings, complete stack traces are available in your Flutter errors out of the box, unless you use [`split-debug-info`](https://flutter.dev/docs/perf/app-size#reducing-app-size) and [`obfuscate`](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/obfuscate) flags. In these cases, you must upload the debug information files generated by the build, so Sentry can show proper stack traces.

## Upload Methods

Sentry offers several methods to upload debug symbols for Flutter applications:

1. **[Sentry Dart Plugin (Recommended)](/platforms/dart/guides/flutter/debug-symbols/dart-plugin)** - The easiest and most reliable way to upload debug symbols for Flutter applications. It automatically processes, filters, and uploads the correct symbol files for iOS, Android, and Web - significantly reducing the chances of misconfiguration.

2. **[Manual Upload Options](/platforms/dart/guides/flutter/debug-symbols/manual-upload)** - Because this method is more complex, requires additional manual steps, and is not currently documented, we do not recommend using it unless absolutely necessary.
