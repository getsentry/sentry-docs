Debug symbols are essential for understanding stack traces in your Dart application when errors occur. Without debug symbols, stack traces from minified or obfuscated code can be difficult or impossible to interpret.

## What Are Debug Symbols?

Debug symbols provide the necessary information to convert program addresses back to function names, source file names, and line numbers. When you build a Dart application, especially with obfuscation or optimization enabled, this information is typically removed from the main application bundle to reduce size.

## When to Upload Debug Symbols

With default settings, complete stack traces are available in your Dart errors out of the box, unless you use [`split-debug-info`](https://flutter.dev/docs/perf/app-size#reducing-app-size) and [`obfuscate`](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/obfuscate) flags. In these cases, you must upload the debug information files generated by the build, so Sentry can show proper stack traces.

## Upload Methods

Sentry offers several methods to upload debug symbols for Dart applications:

1. **[Sentry Dart Plugin (Recommended)](/platforms/dart/guides/flutter/debug-symbols/dart-plugin)** - The easiest way to automatically upload debug symbols for iOS, Android, and Web.

2. **[Manual Upload Options](/platforms/dart/guides/flutter/debug-symbols/manual-upload):**
   - [iOS and macOS](/platforms/apple/dsym/) - Upload dSYM files for symbolication of Apple platform crashes.
   - [Android](/cli/dif/#uploading-files) - Upload mapping files manually using the Sentry CLI.
   - [Android NDK](/cli/dif/#uploading-files) - Upload ELF DWARF debug files for native code crashes.
   - [Web](/cli/releases/#upload-source-maps) - Upload source maps for Flutter web applications.

Choose the method that best suits your workflow and platform requirements. For most users, the Sentry Dart Plugin provides the simplest solution across all platforms.
