The [Sentry Dart Plugin](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dart-plugin) is the recommended way to upload debug symbols for Flutter applications. It uploads debug symbols and source maps to Sentry which supports:
- **Symbolicated stacktraces** - See actual function names instead of obfuscated code
- **Source context** - Stacktraces enhanced with source code around the location of stack frames that caused the error
- **Symbolicated issue titles**
