The [Sentry Dart Plugin](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dart-plugin) is the recommended way to upload debug symbols for Flutter applications. It uploads debug symbols and source maps to Sentry which enables:
- **Readable stack traces** - See actual function names instead of obfuscated code
- **Source context** - View the exact lines of code that caused the error
- **Readable issue titles** - Obfuscated issue titles are now readable
