_(New in version 7.13.1)_

Hive is a lightweight and fast key-value database for Flutter and Dart applications.
The [sentry_hive](https://pub.dev/packages/sentry_hive) package provides `Hive` support for database instrumentation and allows you to track the performance of your queries.

## Instrumentation Behaviour

The created spans will be attached to the transaction on the scope - if no transaction is on the scope the Hive span will not be sent to Sentry.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure:

1. The Sentry Flutter SDK is initialized. Learn more [here](/platforms/flutter/#configure).
2. Tracing is set up. Learn more [here](/platforms/flutter/tracing/).

## Install

Add the `sentry_hive` dependency to install the Hive database instrumentation.

```yml {filename:pubspec.yaml}
dependencies:
sentry_flutter: ^{{@inject packages.version('sentry.dart.flutter', '7.13.1') }}
sentry_hive: ^{{@inject packages.version('sentry.dart.hive', '7.13.1') }}
path_provider: ^2.0.0
```

## Configure

Use `SentryHive` to initialize the instance:

```dart
import 'package:path_provider/path_provider.dart';
import 'package:sentry_hive/sentry_hive.dart';

final appDir = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
SentryHive.init(appDir.path);
```

## Verify

### 1. Execute the Code

```dart
import 'package:sentry_hive/sentry_hive.dart';

Future<void> hiveTest() async {
  final tr = Sentry.startTransaction(
    'hiveTest',
    'db',
    bindToScope: true,
  );

  final appDir = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
  SentryHive.init(appDir.path);

  final catsBox = await SentryHive.openBox<Map>('cats');
  await catsBox.put('fluffy', {'name': 'Fluffy', 'age': 4});
  await catsBox.put('loki', {'name': 'Loki', 'age': 2});
  await catsBox.clear();
  await catsBox.close();

  SentryHive.close();

  await tr.finish(status: const SpanStatus.ok());
}
```

### 2. View the Transaction on Sentry.io

To view the recorded transaction, log into [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and open your project.
Clicking **Performance** will open a page with transactions, where you can select the just recorded transaction with the name `hiveTest`.
