The Sentry SDK uses integrations to hook into the functionality of popular libraries to automatically instrument your application and give you the best data out of the box.

Integrations can automatically add error instrumentation, performance instrumentation, and/or extra context information to your application. Flutter builds on the Dart SDK, so all Dart integrations are available in Flutter as well.
