On this page, we get you up and running with Sentry's Flutter SDK.

<Alert>

If you don't already have an account and Sentry project established, head over to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/signup/), then return to this page.

</Alert>

## Features

In addition to capturing errors, you can monitor interactions between multiple services or applications by [enabling tracing](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/). You can also collect and analyze performance profiles from real users with [profiling](/product/explore/profiling/).

Select which Sentry features you'd like to install in addition to Error Monitoring to get the corresponding installation and configuration instructions below.

## Install

<OnboardingOptionButtons
  options={[
    'error-monitoring',
    'performance',
    'profiling',
    'logs-beta',
  ]}
/>

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your application's runtime. These are platform-specific and allow Sentry to have a deep understanding of how your application works.

To install, run `@sentry/wizard`:

```bash {tabTitle:brew}
brew install getsentry/tools/sentry-wizard && sentry-wizard -i flutter
```

```bash {tabTitle:npx}
npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i flutter
```

[Sentry Wizard](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-wizard) will patch your project accordingly, though you can [set up manually](/platforms/dart/guides/flutter/manual-setup/) if you prefer. You only need to patch the project once. Then you can add the patched files to your version control system.

<Expandable title="The following tasks will be performed by the Sentry Wizard">

- Configure the SDK with your DSN and performance monitoring options in your main.dart file.
- Update your `pubspec.yaml` with the `sentry_flutter` and `sentry_dart_plugin` packages.
- Add an example error to verify your setup.

</Expandable>

## Configure

Configuration should happen as early as possible in your application's lifecycle.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';
import 'package:sentry_flutter/sentry_flutter.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  await SentryFlutter.init(
    (options) {
      options.dsn = '___PUBLIC_DSN___';
      // Adds request headers and IP for users, for more info visit:
      // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/dart/guides/flutter/data-management/data-collected/
      options.sendDefaultPii = true;
      // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ performance
      // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100% of transactions for tracing.
      // We recommend adjusting this value in production.
      options.tracesSampleRate = 1.0;
      // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ performance
      // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ profiling
      // The sampling rate for profiling is relative to tracesSampleRate
      // Setting to 1.0 will profile 100% of sampled transactions:
      // Note: Profiling alpha is available for iOS and macOS since SDK version 7.12.0
      options.profilesSampleRate = 1.0;
      // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ profiling
      // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ logs-beta
      // Enable logs to be sent to Sentry
      options.enableLogs = true;
      // ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ logs-beta
    },
    appRunner: () => runApp(
      SentryWidget(
        child: MyApp(),
      ),
    ),
  );

  // you can also configure SENTRY_DSN, SENTRY_RELEASE, SENTRY_DIST, and
  // SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT via Dart environment variable (--dart-define)
}
```

## Verify

Verify that your app is sending events to Sentry by adding the following snippet, which includes an intentional error. You should see the error reported in Sentry within a few minutes.

```dart
import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';

try {
  throw StateError('Sentry Test Exception');
} catch (exception, stackTrace) {
  await Sentry.captureException(
    exception,
    stackTrace: stackTrace,
  );
}
```
