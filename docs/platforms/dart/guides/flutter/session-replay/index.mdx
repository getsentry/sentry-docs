<Alert>

Flutter Session Replay is available on **iOS** and **Android**.

</Alert>

[Session Replay](/product/explore/session-replay/) helps you get to the root cause of an error or latency issue faster by providing you with a reproduction of what was happening in the user's device before, during, and after the issue. You can rewind and replay your application's state and see key user interactions, like taps, swipes, network requests, and console entries, in a single UI.

By default, our Session Replay SDK masks all text content, images, and user input, giving you heightened confidence that no sensitive data will leave the device. To learn more, see [product docs](/product/explore/session-replay/).

## Pre-requisites

Make sure your Sentry Flutter SDK version is at least `9.0.0`, which is required for Session Replay.
You can update your `pubspec.yaml` to the matching version:

```yaml
dependencies:
  sentry_flutter: ^9.0.0
```

## Setup

To set up replay, enable it by setting a non-zero sample rate and wrapping your root widget with `SentryWidget`:

```dart
await SentryFlutter.init(
  (options) {
    options.dsn = '___DSN___';
    options.replay.sessionSampleRate = 1.0;
    options.replay.onErrorSampleRate = 1.0;
  },
  appRunner: () => runApp(
    SentryWidget(
      child: MyApp(),
    ),
  ),
);
```

## Verify

While you're testing, we recommend that you set `sessionSampleRate` to `1.0`. This ensures that every user session will be sent to Sentry.

Once testing is complete, **we recommend lowering this value in production**. We still recommend keeping `onErrorSampleRate` set to `1.0`.

## Sampling

Sampling allows you to control how much of your website's traffic will result in a Session Replay. There are two sample rates you can adjust to get the replays relevant to you:

1. `sessionSampleRate` - The sample rate for replays that begin recording immediately and last the entirety of a user's session.
2. `onErrorSampleRate` - The sample rate for replays that are recorded when an error happens. This type of replay will record
   up to a minute of events prior to the error and continue recording until the session ends.

Sampling starts as soon as a session begins. The `sessionSampleRate` is then evaluated. If the session is sampled, replay recording will start immediately. If not, `onErrorSampleRate` will be evaluated. If the session is sampled at this point, the replay will be buffered and will only be uploaded to Sentry if an error occurs.

## PII & Privacy Considerations

Personally identifiable information (PII), and privacy are important considerations when enabling Session Replay. The Sentry Flutter SDK aggressively masks all `Text`, `EditableText`, `RichText` and `Image` widgets by default.

While we have default privacy considerations in place, there are additional settings you might need to configure to fully mask your app's content.
We cannot detect the usage of third party widgets such as [FlutterMap](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_map) so you need to manually configure the privacy configuration to mask the content of these widgets.

## Error Linking

Errors that happen while a replay is running will be linked to the replay, making it possible to jump between related issues and replays. However, it's **possible** that in some cases the error count reported on the **Replays Details** page won't match the actual errors that have been captured. That's because errors can be lost, and while this is uncommon, there are a few reasons why it could happen:

- The replay was rate-limited and couldn't be accepted.
- The replay was deleted by a member of your org.
- There were network errors and the replay wasn't saved.
