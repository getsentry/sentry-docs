## General Integration Configuration

The following options can be configured in the `options.replay` field of your Sentry Flutter SDK, in `SentryFlutter.init((options) { ... })`:


| Key                      | Type     | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------ | -------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| sessionSampleRate | `double` | `0`     | The sample rate for replays that begin recording immediately and last the entirety of the user's session. `1.0` collects all replays, and `0` collects none.                                                                                                      |
| onErrorSampleRate | `double` | `0`     | The sample rate for replays that are recorded when an error happens. This type of replay will record up to a minute of events prior to the error and continue recording until the session ends. `1.0` captures all sessions with an error, and `0` captures none. |
| quality | [SentryReplayQuality](https://pub.dev/documentation/sentry_flutter/latest/sentry_flutter/SentryReplayQuality.html) | `SentryReplayQuality.medium` | Defines the image quality of the session replay. The higher the quality, the more accurate the replay will be, but also more data to transfer and more CPU load. |

## Configure Network Details

In order to capture basic information about network requests, you need to use our Sentry integrations for the HTTP client you are using.
This allows the Sentry instrumented HTTP client to capture network details during your replay.

## Configure Screen Names and Navigation Details

In order to capture screen names and navigation breadcrumbs, you need to add our `SentryNavigatorObserver` to your application's `navigatorObservers` and define route names when you navigate to a new screen.

Read more about how to configure the `SentryNavigatorObserver` in our [Routing Instrumentation](/platforms/dart/guides/flutter/integrations/routing-instrumentation/#configure) guide.

## Configure User Interactions

In order to capture user interaction breadcrumbs such as button taps, you need to wrap your root widget with `SentryWidget` and define unique keys for your buttons.

Read more about how to set up user interactions in our [User Interaction Instrumentation](/platforms/dart/guides/flutter/integrations/user-interaction-instrumentation/) guide.
