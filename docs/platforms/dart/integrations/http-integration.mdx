## Using the `SentryHttpClient` function

You can use the `SentryHttpClient` and call its methods directly, or you can use it with the [`runWithClient`](https://pub.dev/documentation/http/latest/http/runWithClient.html) function. If you need to use a fresh instance of the `client` (so that other instances are not affected) or to run in a separate [`Zone`](https://api.dart.dev/stable/3.5.0/dart-async/Zone-class.html), which allows you to override the functionality of the existing [`Zone`](https://api.dart.dev/stable/3.5.0/dart-async/Zone-class.html), then use the `runWithClient` function (see the `runWithClient` tab). Otherwise, just use `SentryHttpClient` directly and call its methods (see the `default` tab).

### Usage

```dart {filename:http_client.dart}{tabTitle: default}
import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';

final client = SentryHttpClient();

try {
  final response = await client.get(Uri.https('www.example.com', ''));
  print(response.body);
} finally {
  client.close();
}
```

```dart {filename:http_client.dart}{tabTitle: runWithClient}
import 'package:http/http.dart';
import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';

final sentryHttpClient = SentryHttpClient();

await runWithClient(() async {
  final response = await get(Uri.https('www.example.com', ''));
  print(response.body);
}, () => sentryHttpClient);
```

## Reporting Bad HTTP Requests as Errors

The `SentryHttpClient` can also catch exceptions that may occur during requests — for example [`SocketException`](https://api.dart.dev/stable/2.13.4/dart-io/SocketException-class.html).

```dart
import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';

var client = SentryHttpClient();
try {
  var uriResponse = await client.post('https://example.com/whatsit/create',
    body: {'name': 'doodle', 'color': 'blue'});
  print(await client.get(uriResponse.bodyFields['uri']));
} finally {
  client.close();
}
```

When an error occurs, the following information is captured and sent to Sentry:

The marked elements (\*) are affected by the default enabled [server-side data scrubbing](https://docs.sentry.io/security-legal-pii/scrubbing/server-side-scrubbing/).
To implement client side data scrubbing, go to [client-side data scrubbing in Flutter](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/flutter/data-management/sensitive-data/).

Request details:

- Method
- URL \*
- Headers \*
- Body \*
- Content length
- Duration

Response details:

- Headers \*
- Content length
- Status code

This is an opt-out feature. The following example shows how to disable it:


```dart
import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  await Sentry.init(
    (options) {
      options.dsn = '___PUBLIC_DSN___';
      options.captureFailedRequests = false;
    },
    appRunner: initApp, // Init your App.
  );
}
```

Furthermore you can track HTTP requests that you consider bad. In the
following example, exceptions are captured for each request
with a status code within the range of 400 to 404, and also for 500.

```dart
import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';

var client = SentryHttpClient(
  failedRequestStatusCodes: [
    SentryStatusCode.range(400, 404),
    SentryStatusCode(500),
  ],
);

try {
  var uriResponse = await client.post('https://example.com/whatsit/create',
    body: {'name': 'doodle', 'color': 'blue'});
  print(await client.get(uriResponse.bodyFields['uri']));
} finally {
  client.close();
}
```

## Tracing for HTTP Requests

<Alert>

Capturing transactions requires that you first <PlatformLink to="/tracing/">set up tracing</PlatformLink> if you haven't already.

</Alert>

The `SentryHttpClient` starts a span out of the active span bound to the scope for each HTTP Request.

```dart
import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';

final transaction = Sentry.startTransaction(
  'webrequest',
  'request',
  bindToScope: true,
);

var client = SentryHttpClient();
try {
  var uriResponse = await client.post('https://example.com/whatsit/create',
    body: {'name': 'doodle', 'color': 'blue'});
  print(await client.get(uriResponse.bodyFields['uri']));
} finally {
  client.close();
}

await transaction.finish(status: SpanStatus.ok());
```
