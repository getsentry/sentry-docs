## Installation Recommendations: GitHub Releases or Fab

<Note>
While Unreal Engine uses "plugins", we will refer to the Sentry support we offer within Unreal Engine as the Sentry Unreal Engine SDK.
</Note>

There are three common ways to install an SDK to use with Unreal Engine:
1. Install from the [Epic Games Fab](https://www.fab.com/) ([formerly known as the marketplace](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/fab-epics-new-unified-content-marketplace-launches-today))
2. Download a pre-built SDK that you install (e.g. from a [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-unreal/releases))
3. Clone and build the SDK yourself and install

Sentry offers all three for you to be able to get the insights only Sentry can provide. However, each has it's own limitations.

### Overview of SDK Versions

The table below highlights some key differences between different versions of the SDK:

| Feature                    | __GitHub Releases__* | Fab                 | Build Yourself |
|----------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Supported engine versions  | 4.27 and newer       | 5.1 and newer       | 4.27 and newer |
| Supported UE project types | C++ only             | Blueprint and C++   | C++ only       |
| Backend (Windows)          | Crashpad             | Breakpad            | Crashpad       |
| `on_crash` hook (Windows)  | Supported            | Not supported       | Supported      |
| Sentry CLI **              | Included             | Manual download     | Included       |

Legend:
`*`: Recommended version of the SDK
`**`: Sentry CLI is a standalone tool that the plugin uses under the hood to automatically upload debug information files upon game build completion.

### Installing from GitHub Releases (Recommended)

The [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-unreal/releases) provides two plugin packages: `github` and `marketplace`. The key difference between the two is the crash capturing backend, which is used under the hood on Windows.

We recommend using the `github` version which uses `Crashpad`, an out-of-proc handler that sends the crash report right away. The `marketplace` version relies on `Breakpad`, an in-proc handler which requires the UE application or game to be relaunched in order to send the crash reports to Sentry.

### Installing from Fab

Sentry SDK can be downloaded via the [standard installation process](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/working-with-plugins-in-unreal-engine#installingpluginsfromtheunrealenginemarketplace) from its [Epic Games Fab page](https://www.fab.com/listings/eaa89d9d-8d39-450c-b75f-acee010890a2).

This method is recommended only for Blueprint UE projects. If you already have a C++ UE project or don't mind converting an existing Blueprint UE project to a C++ one, consider downloading the plugin from GitHub instead.

### Build yourself

To get started, we recommend cloning the [Unreal SDK repository](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-unreal) and running the initialization script:

* `./scripts/init.sh` on macOS/Linux
* `./scripts/init-win.ps1` on Windows

<Note>
Initialization scripts require [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) to be installed.
</Note>

<Note>
If the initialization script fails due to errors on Windows, check your PowerShell version by printing the built-in variable `$PSVersionTable`. If the version is `5.x`, upgrading to a newer version of [PowerShell](https://github.com/powershell/powershell) may resolve these errors.
</Note>

This script links the checked out version of the plugin (the [plugin-dev](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-unreal/tree/b67076ad5dc419d46b4be70a0bd6e64c2357a82d/plugin-dev) directory) to the [sample app](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-unreal/tree/b67076ad5dc419d46b4be70a0bd6e64c2357a82d/sample) and downloads the latest builds of native SDKs from our GitHub CI.

After successful initialization, copy the contents of the `plugin-dev` directory to `<your_project_root>/Plugins/Sentry`. This will allow you to use Sentry in your Unreal Engine project.
