With Sentry Structured Logs, you can send text-based log information from your Unreal Engine applications to Sentry. Once in Sentry, these logs can be viewed alongside relevant errors, searched by text-string, or searched using their individual attributes.

## Performance Considerations

- Logs are sent asynchronously to avoid impacting game performance
- Consider disabling Debug level logs in production to avoid excessive log volume
- Each severity level can be individually controlled to fine-tune what gets sent to Sentry
- Use categories to organize logs and make them easier to search and filter
- Before-log handlers are executed synchronously, so keep processing lightweight
