Environments tell you where an error occurred, whether that's in your production system, your staging server, or elsewhere.

Sentry automatically creates an environment when it receives an event with the `environment` parameter set.

Environments are case-sensitive. The environment name can't contain newlines, spaces or forward slashes, can't be the string "None", or exceed 64 characters. You can't delete environments, but you can [hide](/product/sentry-basics/environments/#hidden-environments) them.

```cpp
FConfigureSettingsDelegate SettingsDelegate;
SettingsDelegate.BindDynamic(this, &USomeClass::HandleSettingsDelegate);

void USomeClass::HandleSettingsDelegate(USentrySettings* Settings)
{
    Settings->Environment = FString(TEXT("MyEnvironment"));
}

...

USentrySubsystem* SentrySubsystem = GEngine->GetEngineSubsystem<USentrySubsystem>();

SentrySubsystem->InitializeWithSettings(SettingsDelegate);
```

By default, the SDK reports `Editor` when running inside the Unreal Engine Editor. You can also set the default environment to `Release`, `Development`, or `Debug` in your build configuration or override the environment value manually.

Environments help you better filter issues, releases, and user feedback in the Issue Details page of sentry.io, which you learn more about in our [documentation that covers using environments](/product/sentry-basics/environments/).
