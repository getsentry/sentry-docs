## Available Options

<TableOfContents ignoreIds={["available-options"]} />

## Core Options

Options that can be read from an environment variable (`SENTRY_DSN`, `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT`, `SENTRY_RELEASE`) are read automatically.

<SdkOption name="Dsn" type="string" envVar="SENTRY_DSN">

The DSN tells the SDK where to send the events. If this value is not provided, the SDK will try to read it from the `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable. If that variable also does not exist, the SDK will just not send any events.

In runtimes without a process environment (such as the browser) that fallback does not apply.

Learn more about [DSN utilization](/product/sentry-basics/dsn-explainer/#dsn-utilization).

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="Debug" type="bool" defaultValue="false">

Turns debug mode on or off. If debug is enabled SDK will attempt to print out useful debugging information if something goes wrong with sending the event. The default is always `false`. It's generally not recommended to turn it on in production, though turning `debug` mode on will not cause any safety concerns.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="Release" type="string" envVar="SENTRY_RELEASE">

Sets the release. Some SDKs will try to automatically configure a release out of the box but it's a better idea to manually set it to guarantee that the release is in sync with your deploy integrations or source map uploads. Release names are strings, but some formats are detected by Sentry and might be rendered differently. Learn more about how to send release data so Sentry can tell you about regressions between releases and identify the potential source in [the releases documentation](/product/releases/) or the <SandboxLink scenario="releases">sandbox</SandboxLink>.

By default the SDK will try to read this value from the `SENTRY_RELEASE` environment variable if it's not set explicitly in the plugin settings. Otherwise, the release name is automatically derived from the current project name and version to match the format `<ProjectName>@<Version>`.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="Environment" type="string" envVar="SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT">

Sets the environment. This string is freeform and not set by default. A release can be associated with more than one environment to separate them in the UI (think `staging` vs `prod` or similar).

By default the SDK will try to read this value from the `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable if it's not set explicitly in the plugin settings. Otherwise, the default environment is the current application's build configuration, i.e. `Editor` or `Development`.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="Dist" type="string">

Sets the distribution of the application. Distributions are used to disambiguate build or deployment variants of the same release of an application. For example, the dist can be the build number of an Xcode build or the version code of an Android build. The dist has a max length of 64 characters.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="SampleRate" type="float" defaultValue="1.0">

Configures the sample rate for error events, in the range of `0.0` to `1.0`. The default is `1.0`, which means that 100% of error events will be sent. If set to `0.1`, only 10% of error events will be sent. Events are picked randomly.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="MaxBreadcrumbs" type="int" defaultValue="100">

This variable controls the total amount of breadcrumbs that should be captured. This defaults to `100`, but you can set this to any number. However, you should be aware that Sentry has a [maximum payload size](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/data-model/envelopes/#size-limits) and any events exceeding that payload size will be dropped.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="AutomaticBreadcrumbs" type="struct" defaultNote="all fields default to false">

Configures whether to automatically add breadcrumbs for specific in-game events. This is a struct containing boolean fields for different event types:
- `bOnMapLoadingStarted` - when map loading starts
- `bOnMapLoaded` - when map is loaded
- `bOnGameStateClassChanged` - when game state changes
- `bOnGameSessionIDChanged` - when game session ID changes
- `bOnUserActivityStringChanged` - when user activity string changes

All fields default to `false`.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="AutomaticBreadcrumbsForLogs" type="struct" defaultNote="enabled for Fatal, Error, and Warning">

Configures whether to automatically add breadcrumbs for log messages at specific verbosity levels. This is a struct containing boolean fields for different log levels:
- `bOnFatalLog` - defaults to `true`
- `bOnErrorLog` - defaults to `true`
- `bOnWarningLog` - defaults to `true`
- `bOnInfoLog` (Display/Log) - defaults to `false`
- `bOnDebugLog` (Verbose/VeryVerbose) - defaults to `false`

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="AttachStacktrace" type="bool" defaultValue="false">

When enabled, stack traces are automatically attached to all messages logged. Stack traces are always attached to exceptions; however, when this option is set, stack traces are also sent with messages. This option, for instance, means that stack traces appear next to all log messages.

This option is turned off by default.

Grouping in Sentry is different for events with stack traces and without. As a result, you will get new groups as you enable or disable this flag for certain events.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="SendDefaultPii" type="bool" defaultValue="false">

If this flag is enabled, certain personally identifiable information (PII) is added by active integrations. By default, no such data is sent.

<Alert>

If you are using Sentry in your mobile app, read our [frequently asked questions about mobile data privacy](/security-legal-pii/security/mobile-privacy/) to assist with Apple App Store and Google Play app privacy details.

</Alert>

This option is turned off by default.

If you enable this option, be sure to manually remove what you don't want to send using our features for managing [_Sensitive Data_](../../data-management/sensitive-data/).

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="AttachScreenshot" type="bool" defaultValue="false">

Takes a screenshot of the application when an error happens and includes it as an attachment.
Learn more about enriching events with screenshots in our <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/screenshots/">Screenshots documentation</PlatformLink>.

<Alert>

Attaching screenshots to crash events is currently not supported on Android.

</Alert>

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="AttachGameLog" type="bool" defaultValue="false">

When enabled, game log file is automatically attached to all events captured if the current build configuration allows logging.

This option is turned off by default.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="AttachGpuDump" type="bool" defaultValue="true">

When enabled, [Nsight Aftermath](https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-aftermath) mini-dump file is automatically attached to GPU crash events captured.

This option is turned on by default.

<Alert>

This feature is currently supported only for Nvidia GPUs.

</Alert>

<Alert>

On Windows, capturing GPU crashes requires [modifying the Unreal Engine source code](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-unreal/issues/673).

</Alert>

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="CrashpadWaitForUpload" type="bool" defaultValue="false">

When enabled, application shutdown is delayed until the upload of the crash report is complete. This is useful for deployment in `Docker` environment (Linux and Windows containers) where the life cycle of all processes is bound by the root process (typically the application being monitored).

This option is turned off by default.

<Alert>

This feature is supported only for Crashpad backend on Windows and Linux (default for the `github` plugin package).

</Alert>

</SdkOption>

## Hooks

These options can be used to hook the SDK in various ways to customize the reporting of events.

The callbacks you set as hooks will be called on the thread where the event happened. If the event occurs on a non-game thread during garbage collection the callback will not be invoked.

<Alert>

If your callback handler class is part of another plugin, ensure that plugin is loaded before the Sentry SDK. Otherwise, the handler won't be found during Sentry settings deserialization at engine startup and won't be executed.

</Alert>

<SdkOption name="BeforeSend" type="function">

This function is called with an SDK-specific message or error event object, and can return a modified event object, or `null` to skip reporting the event. This can be used, for instance, for manual PII stripping before sending.

By the time <PlatformIdentifier name="BeforeSend" /> is executed, all scope data has already been applied to the event. Further modification of the scope won't have any effect.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="BeforeBreadcrumb" type="function">

This function is called with an SDK-specific breadcrumb object before the breadcrumb is added to the scope. When nothing is returned from the function, the breadcrumb is dropped. To pass the breadcrumb through, return the first argument, which contains the breadcrumb object.
The callback typically gets a second argument (called a "hint") which contains the original object from which the breadcrumb was created to further customize what the breadcrumb should look like.

<Alert>

Currently, hints are supported only on Android.

</Alert>

</SdkOption>

## Tracing Options

<SdkOption name="TracesSampleRate" type="float">

A number between `0` and `1`, controlling the percentage chance a given transaction will be sent to Sentry. (`0` represents 0% while `1` represents 100%.) Applies equally to all transactions created in the app. Either this or <PlatformIdentifier name="TracesSampler" /> must be defined to enable tracing.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="TracesSampler" type="function">

A function responsible for determining the percentage chance a given transaction will be sent to Sentry. It will automatically be passed information about the transaction and the context in which it's being created, and must return a number between `0` (0% chance of being sent) and `1` (100% chance of being sent). Can also be used for filtering transactions, by returning 0 for those that are unwanted. Either this or <PlatformIdentifier name="TracesSampleRate" /> must be defined to enable tracing.

</SdkOption>
