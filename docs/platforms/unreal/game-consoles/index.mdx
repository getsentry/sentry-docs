## How It Works

The Unreal SDK is a thin C++ wrapper that provides a consistent Unreal-friendly API (C++ and Blueprints) while delegating to platform-specific SDKs underneath: [sentry-native](/platforms/native/) on Windows/Linux, [sentry-cocoa](/platforms/apple/) on macOS/iOS, and [sentry-java](/platforms/java/) on Android.

On console platforms, the Unreal SDK and console SDK work together:

- The **Unreal layer** provides the API for adding context (breadcrumbs, tags, user data)
- The **console layer** captures native crashes via platform-specific mechanisms

Each console has a different crash capture model:

| Platform            | How crashes are captured                                 |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Xbox**            | SDK integration via Microsoft's GDK (similar to Windows) |
| **PlayStation**     | Crash reports flow through Sony's servers to Sentry      |
| **Nintendo Switch** | Nintendo's crash reporting forwards directly to Sentry   |

## Getting Started

Sentry supports [PlayStation](/platforms/playstation/), [Xbox](/platforms/xbox/) and [Nintendo Switch](/platforms/nintendo-switch/) via the Unreal Engine SDK extensions. Once you submit the middleware verification process, we'll reach out and send you an invite to our private GitHub repositories with console-specific code.
This allows your configuration and custom data set via C++ or Blueprints to show up in non-fatal events as well as crash dumps on these console platforms.

<Alert>
  Access to Sentry's error and crash reporting for consoles is a paid feature.
  We will review the pricing and details with you during the verification
  process.
