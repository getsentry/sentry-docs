<Alert>

Crash capturing on PlayStation doesn't require the Unreal Engine SDK, but in order to add tags and other context, you'll need to install it along with the corresponding plugin extension.

## Nintendo Switch

To get started using Sentry in your Nintendo Switch games, you can go to [CRPORTAL](https://crash-report.wc.lp1.er.srv.nintendo.net/sentry/get_started).
No changes to the game are required, as you can configure Nintendo's servers to start forwarding your crashes to Sentry.

If you want to add additional context to your crash dumps or you want to capture non-fatal events, Sentry offers an Unreal Engine SDK extension specifically for Nintendo Switch.
It allows for adding additional context such as [breadcrumbs](/product/issues/issue-details/breadcrumbs/) and [tags](/product/issues/issue-details/#tags).
To get access to the plugin extension, please reach out via the [Nintendo Developer Authorization](https://developer.nintendo.com/group/development/getting-started/g1kr9vj6/middleware/sentry) form. 
Or via [Sentry Support](https://sentry.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
