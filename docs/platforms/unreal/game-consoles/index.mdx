Sentry supports [PlayStation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/playstation/), [Xbox](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/xbox/) and [Nintendo Switch](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/nintendo-switch/) via the Unreal Engine SDK extensions. Once you submit the middleware verification process, we'll reach out and send you an invite to our private GitHub repositories with console specific code.
This allows your configuration and custom data set via C++ or Blueprints to show up in non-fatal events as well as crash dumps on these console platforms.

<Alert>

Crash capturing on PlayStation doesn't require the Unreal Engine SDK, but in order to add tags and other context, you'll need to install it along with the corresponding plugin extension.
