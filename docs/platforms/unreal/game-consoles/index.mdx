Sentry supports [PlayStation](/platforms/playstation/), [Xbox](/platforms/xbox/) and [Nintendo Switch](/platforms/nintendo-switch/) via the Unreal Engine SDK extensions. Once you submit the middleware verification process, we'll reach out and send you an invite to our private GitHub repositories with console specific code.
This allows your configuration and custom data set via C++ or Blueprints to show up in non-fatal events as well as crash dumps on these console platforms.

<Alert>
Access to Sentry's error and crash reporting for consoles is a paid feature. We will review the pricing and details with you during the verification process.
