Sentry supports [PlayStation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/playstation/), [Xbox](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/xbox/) and [Nintendo Switch](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/nintendo-switch/) via the Unreal Engine SDK extensions. The access to these is given by sending an invite to private repositories on GitHub after you complete the middleware verification process.

<Alert>

Crash capturing on PlayStation doesn't require the Unreal Engine SDK, but in order to add tags and other context, you'll need to install it along with the corresponding plugin extension.
