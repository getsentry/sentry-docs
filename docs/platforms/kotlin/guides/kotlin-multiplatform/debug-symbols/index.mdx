To symbolicate your stack traces, you need to provide debug information to Sentry.
The symbolication process unscrambles the stack traces to reveal the function, file names, and line numbers of the crash.

## Apple

For Apple applications please follow the iOS documentation on [Uploading Debug Symbols](/platforms/apple/guides/ios/dsym) to set up debug symbols upload.

## Android

### Gradle

To upload ProGuard mapping files or Native debug symbols via Gradle you need to install the [Sentry Android Gradle Plugin](/platforms/android/configuration/gradle) in your `androidApp` module:

```kotlin {filename:androidApp/build.gradle.kts}
plugins {
    id("com.android.application")
    id("io.sentry.android.gradle") version "{{@inject packages.version('sentry.java.android.gradle-plugin', '3.0.0') }}"
}

sentry {
  // Prevent Sentry dependencies from being included in the Android app through the AGP.
  autoInstallation {
    enabled.set(false)
  }
  
  // The slug of the Sentry organization to use for uploading proguard mappings/source contexts.
  org.set("___ORG_SLUG___")

  // The slug of the Sentry project to use for uploading proguard mappings/source contexts.
  projectName.set("___PROJECT_SLUG___")

  // The authentication token to use for uploading proguard mappings/source contexts.
  // WARNING: Do not expose this token in your build.gradle files, but rather set an environment
  // variable and read it into this property.
  authToken.set(System.getenv("SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN"))
}
```

After installing the plugin, you need to configure your auth token as an environment variable:

<OrgAuthTokenNote />

```bash
export SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=___ORG_AUTH_TOKEN___
```

Once configured, the plugin will automatically upload the necessary debug symbols to Sentry when a release build is created.
