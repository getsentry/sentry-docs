# Compose Multiplatform

<Alert level="warning" title="Experimental Support">
While Sentry's Kotlin Multiplatform SDK works in Compose Multiplatform (CMP) projects, it isn't natively supported or fully tested for CMP. Some features may behave unexpectedly or provide incomplete data. Use with caution in production environments and report any issues you encounter.
</Alert>

## Overview

**Compose Multiplatform** is JetBrains' declarative UI framework that allows you to build native user interfaces for desktop, web, and mobile platforms using a single Kotlin codebase. It extends Jetpack Compose beyond Android to create multiplatform applications.

You need to use the [Sentry Kotlin Multiplatform SDK](/platforms/kotlin/guides/kotlin-multiplatform/) which provides error tracking across multiple Kotlin targets. While the SDK functions in Compose Multiplatform projects use the same APIs as pure KMP setups, it's important to note a few differences:

- **Experimental support**: The KMP SDK works in CMP projects and currently supports capturing crashes and errors as well as other basic features that are available through the Sentry KMP SDK.
- **Not CMP-native**: No specific CMP optimizations or testing.
- **Untested edge cases**: Some platform-specific behaviors may be incomplete.

## Installation

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your application's runtime.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-install" />

## Configure

Configuration should happen as early as possible in your application's lifecycle to ensure a working instrumentation. Configure with the following steps:

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-config" />

## Verify

This snippet includes an intentional error, so you can test that everything is working as soon as you set it up.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-verify" />

## Supported Platforms

For a complete list of supported platforms and target presets, see the [Kotlin Multiplatform features documentation](/platforms/kotlin/guides/kotlin-multiplatform/features/#supported-platforms).

## Debug Symbols

Error stack traces in your app might appear unreadable or obfuscated, making it hard to debug issues. To make stack traces clear and human-readable in Sentry, you need to upload your app's debug symbols.

### Android

For Android applications, you need to manually upload ProGuard mapping files using the `sentry-cli`. Follow the [ProGuard Mapping Upload guide](/cli/dif/#proguard-mapping-upload) for detailed instructions.

### iOS

For iOS applications, follow the [Uploading Debug Symbols guide](/platforms/apple/guides/ios/dsym) to set up debug symbols upload.
