# Compose Multiplatform

<Alert level="warning" title="Experimental Support">
While Sentry's Kotlin Multiplatform SDK works in Compose Multiplatform projects, it isn't natively supported or fully tested for CMP. Some features may behave unexpectedly or provide incomplete data. Use with caution in production environments and report any issues you encounter.
</Alert>

## Overview

**Compose Multiplatform** is JetBrains' declarative UI framework that allows you to build native user interfaces for desktop, web, and mobile platforms using a single Kotlin codebase. It extends Jetpack Compose beyond Android to create multiplatform applications.

It is required to use the [Sentry Kotlin Multiplatform SDK](/platforms/kotlin/guides/kotlin-multiplatform/) which provides error tracking across multiple Kotlin targets. While the SDK functions in Compose Multiplatform projects using the same APIs as pure KMP setups, it's important to note:

- ‚úÖ **Experimental support**: The KMP SDK works in CMP projects and currently supports capturing crashes and errors as well as other basic features that are available through the Sentry KMP SDK.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Not CMP-native**: No specific CMP optimizations or testing.
- üîç **Untested edge cases**: Some platform-specific behaviors may be incomplete.

## Installation

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your application's runtime.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-install" />

## Configure

Configuration should happen as early as possible in your application's lifecycle.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-config" />

## Verify

This snippet includes an intentional error, so you can test that everything is working as soon as you set it up.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-verify" />

## Debug Symbols

Error stack traces in your app might appear unreadable or obfuscated, making it hard to debug issues. To make stack traces clear and human-readable in Sentry, you need to upload your app's debug symbols.

For step-by-step instructions, see the [Debug Symbols guide](/platforms/kotlin/guides/kotlin-multiplatform/debug-symbols/).
