title: Transaction Name
description: "Learn how to set or override the transaction name to capture the user and gain critical pieces of information that construct a unique identity in Sentry."

The current transaction name is used to group transactions in our [Performance](/product/performance/) product, as well as annotate error events with their point of failure.

The transaction name can reference the current web app route, or the current
task being executed. For example:

- `GET /api/{version}/users/`
- `UserListView`
- `myapp.tasks.renew_all_subscriptions`

Ideally, the transaction name does not contain variable values such as user
IDs but has rather low cardinality while still uniquely identifying a piece of
code you care about.

A lot of our framework integrations already set a transaction name, though you can set one yourself.

To override the name of the currently running transaction:

<PlatformContent includePath="enriching-events/set-transaction-name" />
