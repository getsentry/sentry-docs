When an event is captured and sent to Sentry, SDKs will merge that event data with extra
information from the current scope. SDKs will typically automatically manage the scopes
for you in the framework integrations and you don't need to think about them. However,
you should know what a scope is and how you can use it to your advantage.

## What's a Scope?

Scopes hold useful information that gets sent along with the
event. For instance, [contexts](../context/) and
[breadcrumbs](../breadcrumbs/) are stored on
the scope. When a scope is forked, it inherits all data from its parent scope.

## How Scopes Work

Scopes are basically stacks of data that are attached to events. When an event is captured, the SDK will merge the data from the active scopes into the event. This allows you to attach data to events that is relevant to the context in which the event was captured.

When you call a global function such as `Sentry.captureException`, Sentry automatically discovers the active scopes and applies them when capturing the event.

## Different Kinds of Scopes

The Sentry SDK has three different kinds of scopes:

- [Global scope](#global-scope)
- [Isolation scope](#isolation-scope)
- [Current scope](#current-scope)

The Android SDK does not fork scopes on its own so you may set data on any of the scopes. The Android SDK writes to [current scope](#current-scope) by default when using top level API like `Sentry.setTag`.

### Global Scope

The global scope is applied to _all_ events, no matter where they originate. You can use it to store data that should apply to all events, such as environmental information.

### Isolation Scope

The isolation scope is used to isolate events from each other. For example, each request in a web server might get its own isolation scope, so that events from one request don't interfere with events from another request.

### Current Scope

The current scope is the local scope that is currently active. You can modify the current scope via `Sentry.configureScope(scope -> { ... })`.

## How Scope Data is Applied to Events

Global scope, isolation scope, and current scope are combined before an event (like an error or transaction) gets sent to Sentry.
In most cases, setting something on current scope replaces the same thing that may have been set on isolation or global scope. If it hasn't been set on current scope, the value on isolation scope takes precedence over the one from global scope. If there also isn't any value on isolation scope, the one from global scope is used if present.

Note, there are exceptions to this, where values from all scopes are merged. This is the case for breadcrumbs, tags, extras, contexts, attachments, and event processors.

```java
Sentry.configureScope(ScopeType.GLOBAL, scope -> {
  scope.setExtra("shared", "global");
  scope.setExtra("global", "data");
});

Sentry.configureScope(ScopeType.ISOLATION, scope -> {
  scope.setExtra("shared", "isolation");
  scope.setExtra("isolation", "data");
});

Sentry.configureScope(ScopeType.CURRENT, scope -> {
  scope.setExtra("shared", "current");
  scope.setExtra("current", "data");
});

Sentry.captureException(new Exception("my error"));
// --> Will have the following extra:
// { shared: 'current', global: 'data', isolation: 'data', current: 'data' }
```
```kotlin
Sentry.configureScope(ScopeType.GLOBAL) { scope ->
  scope.setExtra("shared", "global")
  scope.setExtra("global", "data")
}

Sentry.configureScope(ScopeType.ISOLATION) { scope ->
  scope.setExtra("shared", "isolation")
  scope.setExtra("isolation", "data")
}

Sentry.configureScope(ScopeType.CURRENT) { scope ->
  scope.setExtra("shared", "current")
  scope.setExtra("current", "data")
}

Sentry.captureException(Exception("my error"))
// --> Will have the following extra:
// { shared: 'current', global: 'data', isolation: 'data', current: 'data' }
```

## Configuring the Scope

There are two main ways to interact with the scope. You can modify the current scope via `Sentry.configureScope(scope -> { ... })` and use setters on the resulting scope, or you can use global methods like `Sentry.setTag()` directly, which will set on the respective scope under the hood (which will be the isolation scope).

You can, for instance, add custom tags or inform Sentry about the currently authenticated user.

<PlatformContent includePath="enriching-events/scopes/configure-scope" />

You can also apply this configuration when unsetting a user at logout:

<PlatformContent includePath="enriching-events/unset-user" />

<PlatformContent includePath="enriching-events/scopes/scope-synchronization" />

To learn what useful information can be associated with scopes see
[context](../context/), [tags](../tags), [users](../identify-user) and [breadcrumbs](../breadcrumbs/).

## Local Scopes

We also support pushing and configuring a scope within a single call. This is typically
called <PlatformIdentifier name="with-scope" />, <PlatformIdentifier name="push-scope" /> or implemented as a function parameter on the capture methods, depending on the SDK. It's very helpful if
you only want to send data for one specific event.

### Using Scope Callback Parameter

In the following example we use the scope callback parameter that is available for all `capture` methods to attach a `level` and a `tag` to only one specific error:

<PlatformContent includePath="enriching-events/scopes/scope-callback-param" />

Before the callback is invoked the SDK creates a clone of the current scope, and the changes
made will stay isolated within the callback function. This allows you to
more easily isolate pieces of context information to specific locations in your code or
even call `clear` to briefly remove all context information.

<Alert title="Important">

Any exceptions that occur within the callback function for configuring a local scope will not be
caught, and all errors that occur will be silently ignored and **not** reported.
