## Migration from `io.sentry:sentry-android-gradle-plugin:3.x.x` to `io.sentry:sentry-android-gradle-plugin:4.0.0`

### Breaking Changes

- Bumped Sentry Android SDK to `7.0.0`. Refer to the [section below](#migrating-from-iosentrysentry-android-6x-to-iosentrysentry-android-700) for details about changes to the SDK.
- Renamed `experimentalGuardsquareSupport` flag to `dexguardEnabled`.

### Sentry Android SDK Compatibility

You must use Sentry Gradle plugin 4.+ together with the Sentry Android SDK 7.+ otherwise, it might crash at runtime due to binary incompatibility. If you can't do that for some reason, you can specify the Sentry version via the plugin config block:

```kotlin
sentry {
  autoInstallation {
    sentryVersion.set("7.0.0")
  }
}
```

Similarly, if you have a Sentry SDK (e.g. `sentry-android-core`) dependency on one of your Gradle modules and you're updating it to 7.+, make sure the Gradle plugin is at 4.+, or specify the SDK version as shown in the snippet above.

## Migrating from `io.sentry:sentry-android 6.x` to `io.sentry:sentry-android 7.0.0`

### Breaking Changes

- The minimum supported API level was updated to 19 (`minSdk`).
- The `sentry-android-okhttp` classes were deprecated in favor of `sentry-okhttp`, which is a pure Java module and can be used in non-Android projects.
  - The `SentryOkHttpUtils` class was removed from the public API. If you were using it, consider filing a [feature request](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/issues).
- If you're using `sentry-kotlin-extensions`, it now requires `kotlinx-coroutines-core` version `1.6.1` or higher.
- Moved `enableNdk` and `enableScopeSync` from `SentryOptions` to `SentryAndroidOptions`.
- Changed the return type of `SentryApolloInterceptor.BeforeSpanCallback` from `ISpan` to `ISpan?`.
- `Scope` now implements the `IScope` interface, therefore some methods like `ScopeCallback.run` accept `IScope` now.
- Some `Sentry.startTransaction` overloads do not exist anymore, and instead, you can set old options by passing a `TransactionOptions` object in.

For example:

```kotlin
// old
val transaction = Sentry.startTransaction("name", "op", bindToScope = true)
// new
val transaction = Sentry.startTransaction("name", "op", TransactionOptions().apply { isBindToScope = true })
```

### Behavioral Changes

- `Sentry.getSpan()` now returns the root span/transaction instead of the latest span.
  - This will make the span hierarchy leaner and more readable.
- The SDK now captures failed HTTP and GraphQL (Apollo) requests by default.
  - This can increase your event consumption and may affect your quota, because we will report failed network requests as Sentry events if you're using the `sentry-android-okhttp` or `sentry-apollo-3` integrations by default. You can customize what errors you want/don't want to have reported for [OkHttp](/platforms/android/integrations/okhttp/#http-client-errors) and [Apollo3](/platforms/android/integrations/apollo3/#graphql-client-errors) respectively.
- Added a deadline timeout for automatic transactions.
  - This affects all automatically generated transactions on Android (UI, clicks). The default timeout is 30s, meaning the automatic transaction will be force-finished with the status `deadline_exceeded` when it reaches the deadline.
- The SDK now sets `ip_address` to \{\{auto}} by default, even if sendDefaultPII is disabled.
  - We recommend you instead use the "Prevent Storing of IP Addresses" option in the "Security & Privacy" project settings on [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/).
- The `maxSpans` setting (defaults to 1000) is now enforced for nested child spans. This means a single transaction can have `maxSpans` number of children (nested or not) at most.

### Sentry Integrations Version Compatibility

Make sure to align _all_ Sentry dependencies (like `-timber`, `-okhttp` or other packages) to the same version when bumping the SDK to 7.+, otherwise, it will crash at runtime due to binary incompatibility.

For example, if you're using the [Sentry Android Gradle plugin](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-android-gradle-plugin) with the `autoInstallation` [feature](/platforms/android/configuration/gradle/#auto-installation) (enabled by default), make sure to use version 4.+ of the Gradle plugin together with version 7.+ of the SDK. If you can't do that for some reason, you can specify the Sentry version via the plugin config block:

```kotlin
sentry {
  autoInstallation {
    sentryVersion.set("7.0.0")
  }
}
```

Similarly, if you have a Sentry SDK (e.g. `sentry-android-core`) dependency on one of your Gradle modules and you're updating it to 7.+, make sure the Gradle plugin is at 4.+ or specify the SDK version as shown in the snippet above.

### Sentry Self-hosted Compatibility

- Starting with version `7.0.0` of `sentry`, [Sentry's version >= v22.12.0](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/releases) is required to properly ingest transactions with unfinished spans. This only applies to self-hosted Sentry. If you are using [sentry.io](https://sentry.io), no action is needed.

## Migrating from `io.sentry:sentry-android 6.14.x` to `io.sentry:sentry-android 6.15.0`

The `sentry-compose-android` and `sentry-compose` integrations now declare their upstream dependencies as `compileOnly`. Make sure to have the `androidx.navigation:navigation-compose`, `androidx.compose.runtime:runtime`, and `androidx.compose.ui:ui` dependencies on the classpath if you're using those integrations. Otherwise, the application will crash with a `NoClassDefFoundError` exception.

## Migrating from `io.sentry:sentry-android 6.2.x` to `io.sentry:sentry-android 6.3.0`

The `sentry-android-okhttp`, `sentry-android-fragment`, and `sentry-android-timber` integrations now declare their upstream dependencies as `compileOnly`. Make sure to have the `okhttp`, `fragment`, and `timber` dependencies on the classpath if you're using those integrations or the application will crash with a `NoClassDefFoundError` exception.

## Migrating from `io.sentry:sentry-android 6.x` to `io.sentry:sentry-android 6.2.0`

- Kotlin plugin is upgraded to `1.6.10`.

This version is still compatible with Kotlin `1.4`.

<Note>

This only affects integrations that are written in Kotlin, such as `timber`, `fragment`, `okhttp`, `navigation` and `compose`.

</Note>

## Migrating from `io.sentry:sentry-android 5.x` to `io.sentry:sentry-android 6.0.0`

- Kotlin plugin is upgraded to `1.5`.
- Kotlin `languageVersion` is upgraded to `1.4`.
- `Gson` is removed as a transitive dependency and vendored in the SDK.
  - Protocol classes now implement the `JsonSerializable` and `JsonDeserializer` interfaces.
- `SentryOptions#shutdownTimeout` is renamed to `shutdownTimeoutMillis`.
- Removed `@Deprecated` and `@ApiStatus.ScheduledForRemoval` methods
  - `ITransaction#setRequest`
  - `ITransaction#getRequest`
  - `ITransaction#getContexts`
  - `SentryBaseEvent#getOriginThrowable`
  - `SentryOptions#getCacheDirSize`
  - `SentryOptions#setCacheDirSize`
  - `SentryOptions#isEnableSessionTracking`
  - `SentryOptions#setEnableSessionTracking`
- Removed unnecessary abstractions
  - `IBuildInfoProvider` is now `BuildInfoProvider` only.
  - `IHandler` is now `MainLooperHandler` only.
- `ISpan` now has higher precision using the `System#nanoTime` instead of milliseconds.

- Hints changed its type from `Object` to `io.sentry.Hint`

_Old_:

```kotlin
Sentry.captureException(RuntimeException("exception"), "myStringHint")
```

_New_:

```kotlin
val hints = mutableMapOf<String, Any>("myHint" to "myStringHint")
Sentry.captureException(RuntimeException("exception"), hints)
```

- `SentryOptions#enableScopeSync` is now enabled by default, to disable it, see the code snippet below.

```xml {filename:AndroidManifest.xml}
<meta-data android:name="io.sentry.ndk.scope-sync.enable" android:value="false" />
```

- `SentryOptions#sendClientReports` is now enabled by default. To disable it, use the code snippet below:

```xml {filename:AndroidManifest.xml}
<meta-data android:name="io.sentry.send-client-reports" android:value="false" />
```

### Sentry Self-hosted Compatibility

- Starting with version `6.0.0` of `sentry`, [Sentry's version >= v21.9.0](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/releases) is required or you have to manually disable sending client reports via the `sendClientReports` option. This only applies to self-hosted Sentry. If you are using [sentry.io](https://sentry.io), no action is needed.

There are more changes and refactors, but they are not user breaking changes.

## Migrating to `io.sentry:sentry-android-timber 5.6.2`

Starting from version `5.6.2`, the `Timber.tag` usage is no longer supported by our SDK (the tag will not be captured and reflected on Sentry). Please, vote on this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/issues/1900) to let us know if we should provide support for that.

<Note>

Support for `Timber.tag` has been brought back in version `5.7.2`.

</Note>

## Migrating from `io.sentry:sentry-android-gradle-plugin 2.x` to `io.sentry:sentry-android-gradle-plugin 3.0.0`

The `io.sentry.android.gradle` >= `3.0.0` requires [Android Gradle Plugin >= 7.0.0](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/gradle-plugin#7-0-0). For older versions of the Android Gradle Plugin, use `io.sentry.android.gradle:2.+`.

### includeProguardMapping

The `autoUpload` flag has been deprecated in favor of two new options:

- `includeProguardMapping` - Disables/enables Proguard mapping functionality. When enabled, generates a UUID and attempts to upload a Proguard mapping associated with that UUID to Sentry. When `autoUploadProguardMapping` is disabled, the plugin will only generate a `sentry-debug-meta.properties` file containing UUID, which can later be used to manually upload the mapping using, for example [sentry-cli](/product/cli/dif/#proguard-mapping-upload).
- `autoUploadProguardMapping` - Defines whether the gradle plugin should attempt to auto-upload the mapping file to Sentry.
  When `includeProguardMapping` is disabled, this flag has no effect.

_Old_:

```groovy
sentry {
    autoUpload = false
}
```

```kotlin
sentry {
    autoUpload.set(false)
}
```

_New_:

```groovy
sentry {
  includeProguardMapping = true
  autoUploadProguardMapping = false
}
```

```kotlin
sentry {
  includeProguardMapping.set(true)
  autoUploadProguardMapping.set(false)
}
```

### tracingInstrumentation

The `io.sentry.android.gradle` enables the tracing instrumentation (via bytecode manipulation) for `androidx.sqlite` and `androidx.room` libraries by default, to disable it, see the code snippet below.

```groovy
sentry {
    // Enable or disable the tracing instrumentation.
    // Does auto instrumentation for 'androidx.sqlite' and 'androidx.room' libraries.
    // It starts and finishes a Span within any CRUD operation.
    // Default is enabled.
    // Only available v3.0.0 and above.
    tracingInstrumentation {
      enabled = false
    }
}
```

```kotlin
sentry {
    // Enable or disable the tracing instrumentation.
    // Does auto instrumentation for 'androidx.sqlite' and 'androidx.room' libraries.
    // It starts and finishes a Span within any CRUD operation.
    // Default is enabled.
    // Only available v3.0.0 and above.
    tracingInstrumentation {
      enabled.set(false)
    }
}
```

## Migrating from `io.sentry:sentry-android-gradle-plugin 1.x` to `io.sentry:sentry-android-gradle-plugin 2.0.0`

The `io.sentry.android.gradle` >= `2.0.0` requires [Android Gradle Plugin >= 4.0.0](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/gradle-plugin#4-0-0).

The `io.sentry.android.gradle` >= `2.0.0` must be applied to the `app/build.gradle` module (or the module that has `com.android.application` plugin applied).

The `io.sentry.android.gradle` >= `2.0.0` publishes the Gradle Plugin Marker to Maven Central. As a result, you no longer need to set the `classpath`.

_Old_:

```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }

    dependencies {
        classpath 'io.sentry:sentry-android-gradle-plugin:{version}'
    }
}

apply plugin: 'io.sentry.android.gradle'
```

_New_:

```groovy
plugins {
    id "io.sentry.android.gradle" version "{version}"
}

buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("io.sentry.android.gradle") version "{version}"
}

buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```

The `io.sentry.android.gradle` has been rewritten in Kotlin. As a result, the Groovy or Kotlin DSL syntax has slightly changed.

The `autoProguardConfig` flag has been removed, the Android SDK >= `2.0.0` version already merges the ProGuard rules automatically.

_Old_:

```groovy
sentry {
    autoProguardConfig false
    autoUpload true
    uploadNativeSymbols false
    includeNativeSources false
}
```

_New_:

```groovy
sentry {
    autoUpload = true
    uploadNativeSymbols = false
    includeNativeSources = false
}
```

```kotlin
sentry {
    autoUpload.set(true)
    uploadNativeSymbols.set(false)
    includeNativeSources.set(false)
}
```

## Migrating from `io.sentry:sentry-android 4.3.0` to `io.sentry:sentry-android 5.0.0`

You may remove `android:extractNativeLibs="true"` meta-data in the `AndroidManifest` file or `android.bundle.enableUncompressedNativeLibs=false` in the `gradle.properties` file if you're using the [Android Native Development Kit](/platforms/android/configuration/using-ndk/). Sentry can now symbolicate events with the default value of [extractNativeLibs](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/gradle-plugin#extractNativeLibs) and [android.bundle.enableUncompressedNativeLibs](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/gradle-plugin#behavior-changes).

`Sentry#startTransaction` by default does not bind created transaction to the scope. To start transaction with binding to the scope, use one of the new overloaded `startTransaction` methods taking `bindToScope` parameter and set it to `true`. Bound transaction can be retrieved with `Sentry#getSpan`.

All SDK methods have been annotated with [JetBrains Annotations](https://github.com/JetBrains/java-annotations): `@Nullable` and `@NotNull`. Kotlin compiler respects these annotations, so in Kotlin code, some fields that were recognized as not-null, are now nullable, and the other way around.

`SentryBaseEvent#getOriginThrowable` has been deprecated in favor of `SentryBaseEvent#getThrowable`, and `SentryBaseEvent#getThrowable` now returns the unwrapped throwable.

`SentryOptions#getCacheDirSize` has been deprecated in favor of `SentryOptions#getMaxCacheItems`.

`InvalidDsnException` has been removed. It is replaced by `IllegalArgumentException`.

`EventProcessor` interface has a new `default` method which could break the instantiation when using trailing lambdas.

_Old_:

```kotlin
SentryOptions#addEventProcessor { event, _ -> event }
```

_New_:

```kotlin
SentryOptions#addEventProcessor(object : EventProcessor {
    override fun process(event: SentryEvent, hint: Hint): SentryEvent? {
        return event
    }
})
```

A random generated `installationId` replaces `Settings.Secure.ANDROID_ID`, which has been removed. This may affect the number of unique users displayed on the the Issues page and Alerts.
If you always set a custom user using `Sentry.setUser(customUser)`, the behavior has not changed. While you don't have to make any update, if you want to maintain the old behavior, use the following code snippet:

```java
User user = new User();
user.setId(Settings.Secure.ANDROID_ID);

Sentry.setUser(user);
```

`SentryOptions#setEnableSessionTracking(boolean)` is deprecated in favor of `SentryOptions#setEnableAutoSessionTracking(boolean)`. It will be removed in future.

_Old_:

```java
SentryAndroid.init(this, options -> {
    options.setEnableSessionTracking(false);
});
```

_New_:

```java
SentryAndroid.init(this, options -> {
    options.setEnableAutoSessionTracking(false);
});
```

`io.sentry.session-tracking.enable` AndroidManifest meta-data is deprecated in favor of `io.sentry.auto-session-tracking.enable`. It will be removed in future.

_Old_:

```xml {filename:AndroidManifest.xml}
<application>
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.session-tracking.enable" android:value="false" />
</application>
```

_New_:

```xml {filename:AndroidManifest.xml}
<application>
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.auto-session-tracking.enable" android:value="false" />
</application>
```

## Migrating from `io.sentry:sentry-android 4.1.0` to `io.sentry:sentry-android 4.2.0`

`operation` is now a required property of the `SentryTransaction` and `SentrySpan`. Whenever a transaction or span is started, the value for `operation` must be provided:

```java
Sentry.startTransaction("transaction-name", "operation-name");
```

## Migrating from `io.sentry:sentry-android 2.x` to `io.sentry:sentry-android 3.x`

### Package changes

The package `io.sentry.core` has been renamed to `io.sentry`. To compile correctly, replace the strings on all the usages from `io.sentry.core.` to `io.sentry.`

Other than that, the APIs didn't change. Release Heath sets by default. If you prefer not to track the health of your releases, disable it with:

```xml
<application>
  <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.session-tracking.enable" android:value="false" />
</application>
```

## Migrating from `io.sentry:sentry-android 1.x` to `io.sentry:sentry-android 2.x`

With Sentry Android, we've updated the API to resemble the [Unified API](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/miscellaneous/unified-api/) more closely. And now that the SDK isn't built on top of `io.sentry:sentry-java`, Sentry Android has more Android-specific features.

If you want to upgrade from the previous version of the SDK, please check the following sections of changes that may need updating in your code.

### Configuration

The file `sentry.properties` used by the previous version of the SDK has been discontinued. Configurations for the new SDK are in `AndroidManifest.xml` or directly in the code.

Example of the configuration in the Manifest:


```xml
<application>
    <!-- Example of the Sentry DSN setting -->
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.dsn" android:value="___PUBLIC_DSN___" />
</application>
```

If you want to set the configuration manually in the code, you need to initialize the SDK with `SentryAndroid.init()` --- described in [Installation](#installation) --- in the same file as `SentryAndroidOptions`, which holds configuration items.

### Installation

The new SDK can initialize automatically, all you need to do is provide the DSN in your Manifest file, as shown in the previous example in [Configuration](#configuration).

#### Manual Installation

If you want to register any callback to filter and modify events and/or breadcrumbs, or if you want to provide the configuration values via code, you need to initialize the SDK using the `SentryAndroid.init()`.

To initialize the SDK manually:

- Disable the `auto-init` feature by providing the following line in the manifest:

  ```xml
  <application>
      <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.auto-init" android:value="false" />
  </application>
  ```

- Initialize the SDK directly in your application:


```java
SentryAndroid.init(this, options -> {
  options.setDsn("___PUBLIC_DSN___");
});
```

```kotlin
SentryAndroid.init(this) { options ->
  options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
}
```

### Releases

Please note that the new SDK will send with each event a release version in a different format than the previous SDK.

If you are using the [GitHub](/organization/integrations/source-code-mgmt/github/) or [GitLab](/organization/integrations/source-code-mgmt/gitlab/) integrations, you need to do one of the following:

- [Use the new format](/platforms/android/configuration/releases/)
- Set the release in your `AndroidManifest.xml`
- Change your code as described in the configuration section

### API

#### Set tag

_Old_:

```java
Sentry.getContext().addTag("tagName", "tagValue");
```

```kotlin
Sentry.getContext().addTag("tagName", "tagValue")
```

_New_:

```java
Sentry.setTag("tagName", "tagValue");
```

```kotlin
Sentry.setTag("tagName", "tagValue")
```

#### Capture custom exception

_Old_:

```java
try {
  int x = 1 / 0;
} catch (Exception e) {
  Sentry.capture(e);
}
```

```kotlin
try {
  val x = 1 / 0
} catch (e: Exception) {
  Sentry.capture(e)
}
```

_New_:

```java
try {
  int x = 1 / 0;
} catch (Exception e) {
  Sentry.captureException(e);
}
```

```kotlin
try {
  val x = 1 / 0
} catch (e: Exception) {
  Sentry.captureException(e)
}
```

#### Capture a message

_Old_:

```java
Sentry.capture("This is a test");
```

```kotlin
Sentry.capture("This is a test")
```

_New_:

```java
Sentry.captureMessage("This is a test"); // SentryLevel.INFO by default
Sentry.captureMessage("This is a test", SentryLevel.WARNING); // or specific level
```

```kotlin
Sentry.captureMessage("This is a test") // SentryLevel.INFO by default
Sentry.captureMessage("This is a test", SentryLevel.WARNING) // or specific level
```

#### Breadcrumbs

_Old_:

```java
Sentry.getContext().recordBreadcrumb(
  new BreadcrumbBuilder().setMessage("User made an action").build()
);
```

```kotlin
Sentry.getContext().recordBreadcrumb(
  BreadcrumbBuilder().setMessage("User made an action").build()
)
```

_New_:

```java
Sentry.addBreadcrumb("User made an action");
```

```kotlin
Sentry.addBreadcrumb("User made an action")
```

#### User

_Old_:

```java
Sentry.getContext().setUser(
  new UserBuilder().setEmail("hello@sentry.io").build()
);
```

```kotlin
Sentry.getContext().setUser(
  UserBuilder().setEmail("hello@sentry.io").build()
)
```

_New_:

```java
User user = new User();
user.setEmail("hello@sentry.io");
Sentry.setUser(user);
```

```kotlin
val user = User().apply {
  email = "hello@sentry.io"
}
Sentry.setUser(user)
```

#### Set extra

_Old_:

```java
Sentry.getContext().addExtra("extra", "thing");
```

```kotlin
Sentry.getContext().addExtra("extra", "thing")
```

_New_:

```java
Sentry.setExtra("extra", "thing");
```

```kotlin
Sentry.setExtra("extra", "thing")
```

#### Clear the Context/Scope

_Old_:

```java
Sentry.clearContext();
```

```kotlin
Sentry.clearContext()
```

_New_:

```java
Sentry.configureScope(s -> s.clear());
```

```kotlin
Sentry.configureScope { it.clear() }
```

### Sentry Gradle Plugin

Disable the `autoProguardConfig` flag from the Sentry Gradle Plugin since `io.sentry:sentry-android` >= `2.0.0` does this automatically.

```groovy
sentry {
    autoProguardConfig false
}
```
