The only way to get accurate metrics is to measure performance overhead yourself. You can apply realistic access patterns against your own application, and correlate that to your own topline business metrics. You can learn more about the various optimizations implemented in the Android Replay SDK in the [Replay Performance Overhead](/product/explore/session-replay/mobile/performance-overhead/) documentation.

We measured the overhead of the Android Replay SDK using the [Pocket Casts](https://github.com/Automattic/pocket-casts-android) open-source app, which includes a diverse set of components such as Fragments, Activities, and Jetpack Compose screens. The benchmarks were conducted with full masking enabled, using optimized release builds, and running through the same user flow 10 times. This approach ensured the measurements closely reflect the overhead in a real-world application. Here are the results (median values are shown):

| Metric                           | Sentry SDK only | Sentry + Replay SDK |
| -------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| FPS                              | 55 fps          | 54 fps              |
| Memory                           | 255 MB          | 265 MB              |
| CPU                              | 36%             | 42%                 |
| App Startup Time (Cold)          | 1533.35 ms      | 1539.55 ms          |
| Main Thread Time                 | n/a             | 20ms                |
| Network Bandwidth                | n/a             | 35 KB               |


The benchmarks were run on a Pixel 2XL with Android 11.

<Note>

Jetpack Compose view hierarchies may be slower to snapshot initially due to ART optimizations compared to the traditional Android View System, but their performance improves as execution progresses.
