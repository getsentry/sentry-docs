[Session Replay](/product/explore/session-replay/) helps you get to the root cause of an error or latency issue faster by providing you with a reproduction of what was happening in the user's device before, during, and after the issue. You can rewind and replay your application's state and see key user interactions, like taps, swipes, network requests, and console entries, in a single UI.

By default, our Session Replay SDK masks all text content, images, and user input, giving you heightened confidence that no sensitive data will leave the device. To learn more, see [product docs](/product/explore/session-replay/).

## Pre-requisites

Make sure your Sentry Android SDK version is at least 7.12.0.

## Install

The easiest way to update through the Sentry Android Gradle plugin to your app module's `build.gradle` file.

```groovy {filename:app/build.gradle}
plugins {
  id "com.android.application"
  id "io.sentry.android.gradle" version "{{@inject packages.version('sentry.java.android.gradle-plugin', '4.10.0') }}"
}
```

```kotlin {filename:app/build.gradle.kts}
plugins {
  id("com.android.application")
  id("io.sentry.android.gradle") version "{{@inject packages.version('sentry.java.android.gradle-plugin', '4.10.0') }}"
}
```

If you have the SDK installed without the Sentry Gradle Plugin, you can update the version directly in the `build.gradle` through:

```groovy {filename:app/build.gradle}
dependencies {
    implementation 'io.sentry:sentry-android:{{@inject packages.version('sentry.java.android', '7.12.0') }}'
}
```

```kotlin {filename:app/build.gradle.kts}
dependencies {
    implementation("io.sentry:sentry-android:{{@inject packages.version('sentry.java.android', '7.12.0') }}")
}
```

## Set Up

To set up the integration, add the following to your Sentry initialization.

```kotlin
SentryAndroid.init(context) { options ->
  options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
  options.isDebug = true

  options.sessionReplay.onErrorSampleRate = 1.0
  options.sessionReplay.sessionSampleRate = 0.1
}
```

```XML {filename:AndroidManifest.xml}
<meta-data android:name="io.sentry.session-replay.on-error-sample-rate" android:value="1.0" />
<meta-data android:name="io.sentry.session-replay.session-sample-rate" android:value="0.1" />
```

## Verify

While you're testing, we recommend that you set `sessionSampleRate` to `1.0`. This ensures that every user session will be sent to Sentry.

Once testing is complete, **we recommend lowering this value in production**. We still recommend keeping `onErrorSampleRate` set to `1.0`.

## Sampling

Sampling allows you to control how much of your website's traffic will result in a Session Replay. There are two sample rates you can adjust to get the replays relevant to you:

1. `sessionSampleRate` - The sample rate for
   replays that begin recording immediately and last the entirety of the user's session.
2. `onErrorSampleRate` - The sample rate for
   replays that are recorded when an error happens. This type of replay will record
   up to a minute of events prior to the error and continue recording until the session
   ends.

Sampling begins as soon as a session starts. `sessionSampleRate` is evaluated first. If it's sampled, the replay recording will begin. Otherwise, `onErrorSampleRate` is evaluated and if it's sampled, the integration will begin buffering the replay and will only upload it to Sentry if an error occurs. The remainder of the replay will behave similarly to a whole-session replay.

## Privacy

The SDK is recording and aggressively masking all text, images, and webviews by default. If your app has any sensitive data, you should only turn the default masking off after explicitly masking out the sensitive data, using the APIs described below.
However, if you're working on a mobile app that's free of PII or other types of private data, you can opt out of the default text and image masking settings. To learn more about Session Replay privacy, [read our docs](/platforms/android/session-replay/privacy/).

<Alert>

If you find that any other data isn't being masked with the default settings, please let us know by creating a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Platform%3A+Android%2CType%3A+Bug&projects=&template=bug_report_android.yml).

</Alert>

To disable masking altogether (not to be used on applications with sensitive data):

```kotlin
options.sessionReplay.maskAllText = false
options.sessionReplay.maskAllImages = false
```

```XML {filename:AndroidManifest.xml}
<meta-data android:name="io.sentry.session-replay.mask-all-text" android:value="false" />
<meta-data android:name="io.sentry.session-replay.mask-all-images" android:value="false" />
```

## Error Linking

Errors that happen while a replay is running will be linked to the replay, making it possible to jump between related issues and replays. However, it's **possible** that in some cases the error count reported on the **Replays Details** page won't match the actual errors that have been captured. That's because errors can be lost, and while this is uncommon, there are a few reasons why it could happen:

- The replay was rate-limited and couldn't be accepted.
- The replay was deleted by a member of your org.
- There were network errors and the replay wasn't saved.

## FAQ

Q: **Why are parts of my replay not masked?**

A: Text fields, input fields, images, video players and webviews are all masked by default. Local assets, such as colors or vector drawables, aren't masked because the likelihood of these assets containing PII is low. If you encounter a view/component that should be masked by default, consider opening a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/issues).

Q: **Does Session Replay work with Jetpack Compose?**

A: Yes, by default, text, input field, and image composables should be masked. Masking within embedded Android views (`AndroidView`)
in Compose isn't currently supported. If you encounter composables that aren't masked but should be, consider opening a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/issues).

Q: **What's the lowest version of Android supported?**

A: Recording only happens on Android 8 (API level 26) or newer. For devices running an older version, SDK features other than recording work normally.

Q: **Why is my issue missing a replay?**

A: An issue may be missing a replay because the user's device was [offline](/product/explore/session-replay/mobile#frequently-asked-questions) while `sessionSampleRate` was specified, your project/organization was rate-limited, or (in rare cases) the device failed to capture the replay video.
