<Expandable title="Why are parts of my replay not masked?" permalink>

Text fields, input fields, images, video players, and webviews are all masked by default. Local assets, such as colors or vector drawables, aren't masked because the likelihood of these assets containing PII is low. If you encounter a view or component that should be masked by default, consider opening a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/issues).

<Expandable title="Does Session Replay work with Jetpack Compose?" permalink>

Yes, by default, text, input field, and image composables should be masked. Masking within embedded Android views (`AndroidView`)
in Compose isn't currently supported. If you encounter composables that aren't masked but should be, consider opening a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/issues).

<Expandable title="What's the lowest version of Android supported?" permalink>

Recording only happens on Android 8 (API level 26) or newer. For devices running an older version, SDK features other than recording work normally.

<Expandable title="Why is my issue missing a replay?" permalink>

An issue may be missing a replay because the user's device was [offline](/product/explore/session-replay/mobile#frequently-asked-questions) while `sessionSampleRate` was specified, your project/organization was rate-limited, or (in rare cases) the device failed to capture the replay video.
