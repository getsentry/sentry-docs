## Enable Profiling

<Note>

Android profiling is available starting in SDK version `6.16.0`.
App start profiling is available starting in SDK version `7.3.0`.

</Note>

In `AndroidManifest.xml`:

<SignInNote />

```xml
<application>
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.dsn" android:value="___PUBLIC_DSN___" />
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.traces.sample-rate" android:value="1.0" />
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.traces.profiling.sample-rate" android:value="1.0" />
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.traces.profiling.enable-app-start" android:value="true" />
</application>
```

<Note>

The `io.sentry.traces.profiling.sample-rate` setting is _relative_ to the `io.sentry.traces.sample-rate` setting.

Profiling requires Sentry’s performance monitoring to be enabled via `io.sentry.traces.sample-rate` in the example above. Read our <PlatformLink to="/performance/">performance setup documentation</PlatformLink> to learn how to configure sampling. Setting the sample rate to 1.0 means all transactions will be captured.

</Note>

## App Start Profiling

By default, some transactions will be created automatically for common operations like loading a view controller/activity and app startup.

When app start profiling is enabled, the whole app start process is profiled.  
This includes all methods from any `ContentProvider`, the `Application` class, and the first Activity, until the <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/">first automatic Activity transaction</PlatformLink> is finished.  
App start profiling can be enabled with the manifest option `io.sentry.traces.profiling.enable-app-start` as shown above, and it will respect the `io.sentry.traces.sample-rate` and the `io.sentry.traces.profiling.sample-rate`.  
If you prefer to use a <PlatformLink to="/configuration/sampling/#setting-a-sampling-function">sampling function</PlatformLink>, the SDK sets the `isForNextAppStart` field on the `TransactionContext` to specify it will be used for the next app start profiling.

<Note>

The SDK won't run app start profiling the very first time the app runs, as the SDK won't have read the options by the time the profile should run.  
The SDK will set the `isForNextAppStart` flag in `TransactionContext` if app start profiling is enabled.

</Note>
