## Enable Tracing

Profiling depends on Sentryâ€™s Tracing product being enabled beforehand. To enable tracing in the SDK:

In `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<application>
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.dsn" android:value="___PUBLIC_DSN___" />
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.traces.sample-rate" android:value="1.0" />
</application>
```

Check out the <PlatformLink to="/tracing/">tracing setup documentation</PlatformLink> for more detailed information on how to configure sampling. Setting the sample rate to 1.0 means all transactions will be captured.

By default, some transactions will be created automatically for common operations like loading a view controller/activity and app startup.

## Enable Profiling

<Note>

Android profiling is available starting in SDK version `6.16.0` and is supported on API level 22 and up.
App start profiling is available starting in SDK version `7.3.0`.

</Note>

In `AndroidManifest.xml`:


```xml
<application>
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.dsn" android:value="___PUBLIC_DSN___" />
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.traces.sample-rate" android:value="1.0" />
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.traces.profiling.sample-rate" android:value="1.0" />
    <meta-data android:name="io.sentry.traces.profiling.enable-app-start" android:value="true" />
</application>
```

<Note>

The `io.sentry.traces.profiling.sample-rate` setting is _relative_ to the `io.sentry.traces.sample-rate` setting.

</Note>

## App Start Profiling

When app start profiling is enabled, the whole app start process is profiled.
This includes all methods from any `ContentProvider`, the `Application` class, and the first Activity, until the <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/">first automatic Activity transaction</PlatformLink> is finished.
App start profiling can be enabled with the manifest option `io.sentry.traces.profiling.enable-app-start` as shown above, and it will respect the `io.sentry.traces.sample-rate` and the `io.sentry.traces.profiling.sample-rate`.
If you prefer to use a <PlatformLink to="/configuration/sampling/#setting-a-sampling-function">sampling function</PlatformLink>, the SDK sets the `isForNextAppStart` field on the `TransactionContext` to specify it will be used for the next app start profiling.

<Note>

The SDK won't run app start profiling the very first time the app runs, as the SDK won't have read the options by the time the profile should run.
The SDK will set the `isForNextAppStart` flag in `TransactionContext` if app start profiling is enabled.

</Note>
