The User Feedback feature allows you to collect user feedback from anywhere inside your application at any time, without needing an error event to occur first.

<Alert>
If you're using a self-hosted Sentry instance, you'll need to be on version 24.4.2 or higher in order to use the full functionality of the User Feedback feature. Lower versions may have limited functionality.
Ensure you are using the Android SDK version 8.13.0 or above of the SDK to access the latest features.
</Alert>

## User Feedback Widget

The User Feedback widget allows users to submit feedback from anywhere inside your application.

### Set Up

To start using the User Feedback widget in your Android application, just start the SDK.
A `SentryUserFeedbackDialog` will be available to be used in your app.
For the configuration options, please refer to the <PlatformLink to="/user-feedback/configuration/">User Feedback Widget Configuration</PlatformLink>.

```java
import io.sentry.android.core.SentryUserFeedbackDialog;

// Just instantiate the dialog and show it whenever you want
new SentryUserFeedbackDialog(context).show();
```
```kotlin
import io.sentry.android.core.SentryUserFeedbackDialog

// Just instantiate the dialog and show it whenever you want
SentryUserFeedbackDialog(context).show()
```

### Session Replay

The User Feedback widget integrates seamlessly with Session Replay. When the widget is opened, the SDK buffers up to 30 seconds of the user's session. If feedback is submitted, this replay is sent along with the feedback, allowing you to view both the feedback and the user's actions leading up to the feedback submission.

## User Feedback API

The User Feedback API allows you to collect user feedback while using your own UI components. You can submit feedback directly using the `Sentry.captureFeedback(Feedback)` method:

```java
import io.sentry.Sentry;
import io.sentry.protocol.Feedback;

Feedback feedback = new Feedback("I encountered a bug while using the app.");
feedback.setName("John Doe");
feedback.setContactEmail("john.doe@example.com");
Sentry.captureFeedback(feedback);
```
```kotlin
import io.sentry.Sentry
import io.sentry.protocol.Feedback

val feedback = Feedback("I encountered a bug while using the app.")
feedback.name = "John Doe"
feedback.contactEmail = "john.doe@example.com"
Sentry.captureFeedback(feedback)
```
