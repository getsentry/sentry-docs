Sentry's Android SDK enables automatic reporting of errors and exceptions, and identifies performance issues in your application. The below, is a list of features that are available as part of this SDK.

- Native Development Kit (NDK), the set of tools that that allows you to use C and C++ with Android.
- Events [enriched with device data](/platforms/android/enriching-events/context/).
- Offline caching. (If a device is offline, we'll send a report once the application has been restarted.)
- [Automatic breadcrumbs](/platforms/android/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/#automatic-breadcrumbs) for:
  - Android activity lifecycle events.
  - Application lifecycle events.
  - System events such as: low battery, low storage space, airplane mode started, shutdown, changes of the configuration, and so forth.
  - Application component callbacks.
  - User Interactions such as: view click, scroll, swipe, and so on.
  - Android [fragment](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/fragment/) lifecycle events.
  - [OkHttp](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/okhttp/) requests.
  - [Apollo](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/apollo/) requests.
  - [Timber logs](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/timber/).
  - [Navigation destination](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/navigation/) changes.
- [Release health](/product/releases/health/), tracking crash-free users and sessions.
- [Attachments](/platforms/android/enriching-events/attachments/) that can enrich your event by storing additional files, such as config or log files.
- [User Feedback](/platforms/android/enriching-events/user-feedback/), providing the ability to collect user information when an event occurs.
- [Tracing](/product/performance/) that can track:
    - Android activity transactions.
    - User interaction transactions such as: view click, scroll, swipe, and so on.
    - [Navigation transactions](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/navigation/).
    - Android [fragment spans](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/fragment/).
    - [Cold and warm app starts](/platforms/android/tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#app-start-instrumentation).
    - [Slow and frozen frames](/platforms/android/tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#slow-and-frozen-frames).
    - [OkHttp request spans](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/okhttp/).
    - [SQLite and Room query spans](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/room-and-sqlite/).
    - [File I/O spans](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/file-io/).
    - [Apollo request spans](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/apollo/).
    - Distributed tracing through [OkHttp](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/okhttp/) and [Apollo](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/apollo/) integrations.
- [Application Not Responding (ANR)](/platforms/android/configuration/app-not-respond/), reported if the application is blocked for more than five seconds.
- [HTTP Client Errors](/platforms/android/configuration/integrations/okhttp/#http-client-errors).
- [Screenshot attachments for errors](/platforms/android/enriching-events/screenshots/).
- [View Hierarchy attachments for errors](/platforms/android/enriching-events/viewhierarchy/).
- Code samples provided in both Kotlin and Java (since the Android SDK uses both languages).
- A [sample application](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/tree/main/sentry-samples/sentry-samples-android) for our Android users.
