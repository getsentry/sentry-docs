Sentry's Android SDK enables automatic reporting of errors and exceptions, and identifies performance issues in your application. The below, is a list of features that are available as part of this SDK.

<Expandable title="Already using Sentry for Android? Here are some recent highlights">

We released <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/perf-v2/">Performance-V2</PlatformLink>,
a set of experimental features to give you more details about app start performance and frame delay on a span level.

We released <PlatformLink to="/enhance-errors/source-context">Source Context</PlatformLink>, which shows snippets of code around the location of stack frames.

Let us know if you have feedback by filing a <Link to="https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Platform%3A+Android%2CType%3A+Bug&template=bug_report_android.yml">GitHub issue</Link>.

- Events <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/context">enriched with device data</PlatformLink>.
- Offline caching. (If a device is offline, we'll send a report once the application has been restarted.)
- <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/#automatic-breadcrumbs">Automatic breadcrumbs</PlatformLink> for:
  - Android activity lifecycle events.
  - Application lifecycle events.
  - System events such as: low battery, low storage space, airplane mode started, shutdown, changes of the configuration, and so forth.
  - Application component callbacks.
  - User Interactions such as: view click, scroll, swipe, and so on.
  - Android <PlatformLink to="/configuration/integrations/fragment">fragment</PlatformLink> lifecycle events.

- <Link to="/product/releases/health">Release health</Link>, tracking crash-free users and sessions.
- <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/attachments">Attachments</PlatformLink> that can enrich your event by storing additional files, such as config or log files.
- <PlatformLink to="/user-feedback">User Feedback</PlatformLink>, providing the ability to collect user information when an event occurs.
- <Link to="/product/performance">Tracing</Link> that can track:
    - Android activity transactions.
    - User interaction transactions such as: view click, scroll, swipe, and so on.
    - <PlatformLink to="/configuration/integrations/navigation">Navigation transactions</PlatformLink>.
    - Android <PlatformLink to="/configuration/integrations/fragment">fragment spans</PlatformLink>.
    - <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#app-start-instrumentation">Cold and warm app starts</PlatformLink>.
    - <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#slow-and-frozen-frames">Slow and frozen frames</PlatformLink>.
    - <PlatformLink to="/configuration/integrations/okhttp">OkHttp request spans</PlatformLink>.
    - <PlatformLink to="/configuration/integrations/room-and-sqlite">SQLite and Room query spans</PlatformLink>.
    - <PlatformLink to="/configuration/integrations/file-io">File I/O spans</PlatformLink>.
    - <PlatformLink to="/configuration/integrations/apollo">Apollo request spans</PlatformLink>.
    - Distributed tracing through <PlatformLink to="/configuration/integrations/okhttp">OkHttp</PlatformLink> and <PlatformLink to="/configuration/integrations/apollo">Apollo</PlatformLink> integrations.
- <PlatformLink to="/configuration/app-not-respond">Application Not Responding (ANR)</PlatformLink>, reported if the application is blocked for more than five seconds.
- <PlatformLink to="/configuration/integrations/okhttp/#http-client-errors">HTTP Client Errors</PlatformLink>.
- <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/screenshots">Screenshot attachments for errors</PlatformLink>.
- <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/viewhierarchy">View Hierarchy attachments for errors</PlatformLink>.
- Code samples provided in both Kotlin and Java (since the Android SDK uses both languages).
- A <Link to="https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/tree/main/sentry-samples/sentry-samples-android">sample application</Link> for our Android users.
