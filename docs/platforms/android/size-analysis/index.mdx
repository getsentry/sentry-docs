description: Upload Android builds to Sentry for Size Analysis.

<Include name="size-analysis/ea" />

[Size Analysis](/product/size-analysis) helps monitor your mobile app's size in pre-production to prevent unexpected size increases (regressions) from reaching users. Aside from being courteous to your users, a smaller app size helps boost installation and retention rates, especially for customers with limited storage or slower connections.

## Getting Started

**Accepted Formats**: AAB (preferred) | APK

**Upload Mechanisms**: [Gradle](#uploading-with-gradle) | [Sentry CLI](#uploading-with-the-sentry-cli)

### Uploading with Gradle

<Include name="size-analysis/upload-gradle" />

### Uploading with the Sentry CLI

<Include name="size-analysis/upload-cli-android" />

## Upload Metadata

<Include name="size-analysis/upload-metadata" />

### Build Configuration

<Include name="size-analysis/build-configuration-android" />

## Best Practices

- **Upload release builds only** - Only upload optimized release builds to get accurate size metrics that represent what users download. Debug builds contain extra symbols and debugging information that inflate the size.

- **Upload on every commit to main** - Configure your CI pipeline to upload builds for every commit merged to your main branch. This creates a complete historical record of your app's size evolution and helps identify which commits introduced size changes.

- **Upload on every PR** - Set up CI to upload builds for every pull request. This enables automatic size comparisons between the PR build and the base branch, allowing you to catch size regressions during code review before merging.
