The Android SDK uses the following channels to release SDK updates:

## `Pre-release`

Pre-releases (alpha, beta, RC,â€¦) are for larger and potentially more impactful changes, such as new features or major versions.

## `Latest`

We continuously release major/minor/hotfix versions from the `main` branch. These releases go through all our internal quality gates and are very safe to use. They're intended to be the default for most teams.

## `Stable`

Releases are promoted from `Latest` to `Stable` when they've been used in the field for some time and at some scale. The length of time a release has been out, the level of adoption, and other quality and stability metrics are considered. These releases will be indicated on the <Link to="https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/releases/">releases page</Link> with the `Stable` label.

## FAQ

### Where can I find the latest stable release for any given SDK?

On the releases pages of the SDK's GitHub repo. Stable releases will be indicated with the label `(Stable)` in the name of the release. You can also use the search box in the top right to search for the newest releases.

### Does this mean the release channels are not stable?

No. Stability and performance are the top priorities for every release. The `Stable` release status means that the release has been tested and proven to work in the wild and at scale.

### How often do we mark SDKs as stable?

The stable release cycle depends on a number of factors and can vary, but the target cadence is to provide stable releases roughly every month.

### Should I only use stable releases?

This is a personal choice for you, your team, and your company. As stated earlier, every release is considered stable, but `Stable` releases have been tested longer with the tradeoff of a slightly delayed availability. This is also the reason why there isn't a pre-release for every release.

### How does this relate to the release process and stability of a feature?

This process doesn't affect the release process and stability of specific SDK or Product features, such as Session Replay. For example, a new feature that is still experimental might be part of a stable SDK release, and it will be opt-in and clearly marked as experimental.
