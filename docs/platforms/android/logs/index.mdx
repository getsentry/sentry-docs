With Sentry Structured Logs, you can send text-based log information from your applications to Sentry. Once in Sentry, these logs can be viewed alongside relevant errors, searched by text-string, or searched using their individual attributes.

### Missing Logs for Crashes

Logs can get lost in certain crash scenarios, if the SDK can not send the logs before the app terminates. We are [currently working on improving](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-java/issues/4690) this to ensure that all logs are sent, at the latest on the next app restart.
