Using multiple Android SDK dependencies with mixed versions is not supported as it is very likely to lead to a crash later on. For this reason we chose to crash the application on SDK init instead.

## Multiple Dependencies With Mixed Versions

The following snippet shows a mixed version conflict caused by using `sentry` with version `8.6.0` and `sentry-android` with version `8.7.0`. To fix the issue, set the same version for all dependencies or <PlatformLink to="/configuration/bill-of-materials/">use `sentry-bom`</PlatformLink>. This may also happen if you are using an internal library which has a different version defined.

```groovy {tabTitle:Gradle}{filename:build.gradle}
implementation('io.sentry:sentry:8.6.0')
implementation('io.sentry:sentry-android:8.7.0')
```
```xml {tabTitle:Maven}{filename:pom.xml}
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.sentry</groupId>
            <artifactId>sentry</artifactId>
            <version>8.6.0</version>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.sentry</groupId>
            <artifactId>sentry-android</artifactId>
            <version>8.7.0</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

## Build Plugin And Explicit Dependency

When using our Gradle or Maven plugin and manually defining additional Sentry Android SDK dependencies, it is also possible to end up with mixed versions. The following snippet shows the plugin being configured to use version `8.0.0` but there is an additional dependency that has been set to version `8.1.0`. To fix the issue,  set the same version or <PlatformLink to="/configuration/bill-of-materials/">use `sentry-bom`</PlatformLink>.

```groovy {tabTitle:Gradle}{filename:build.gradle}
plugins { id "io.sentry.android.gradle" version "5.3.0" }

dependencies {
	implementation 'io.sentry:sentry-okhttp:8.1.0'
}

sentry {
	autoInstallation {
		sentryVersion = "8.0.0"
	}
}
```
