---

Sentry's Apple SDK for tvOS enables automatic reporting of errors and exceptions, and identifies performance issues in your application. All features listed below are **enabled by default** unless otherwise noted.

<Alert>

The SDK builds a crash report that persists to disk. While it attempts to send the report right after the crash, it may not always work because the environment may be unstable at the time of the crash. If this is the case, the report will be sent upon application start.

</Alert>

For a complete list of all available features, see the <PlatformLink to="/common/features">main Features page</PlatformLink>. This page highlights tvOS-specific features and limitations.

## tvOS Limitations

tvOS has some limitations compared to iOS:

- User Feedback UI not available
- Screenshot capture not available
- Profiling not available
- MetricKit integration not available

## Available Features on tvOS

### Session Replay

<PlatformLink to="/common/session-replay">Session Replay</PlatformLink> records user sessions for visual debugging, helping you understand what happened before, during, and after an error.

<Alert level="info">

Session Replay works on tvOS 16+, but it is only officially supported on iOS. While the feature may function on tvOS, we cannot guarantee its reliability or provide full support for tvOS-specific issues.

</Alert>

- Works on tvOS 16+ (not officially supported)
- Requires SDK version 8.31.1 or later

### Performance Monitoring

tvOS supports comprehensive performance monitoring:

- App start tracking for cold and warm app start times
- Frame rate tracking for UI rendering performance and slow/frozen frame identification
- User interaction tracking that automatically creates transactions for UI interactions
- Network request monitoring for HTTP request performance
- File I/O performance tracking for file operations
- Core Data performance tracking for Core Data query performance

### Error Detection

tvOS supports comprehensive error detection:

- Crash detection for all types of crashes and exceptions
- <PlatformLink to="/configuration/app-hangs/">App hang detection</PlatformLink> for when the app becomes unresponsive
- <PlatformLink to="/configuration/watchdog-terminations/">Watchdog termination tracking</PlatformLink> for out-of-memory terminations
- <PlatformLink to="/configuration/http-client-errors">HTTP client errors</PlatformLink> automatically captured

### Event Enrichment

- <PlatformLink to="/guides/ios/enriching-events/viewhierarchy/">View Hierarchy</PlatformLink> capture when errors occur
- <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/#automatic-breadcrumbs">Breadcrumbs automatically</PlatformLink> captured for app lifecycle, system events, and network requests
- Events <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/context">enriched</PlatformLink> with device and environment data
- <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/attachments">Attachments</PlatformLink> for storing additional files with events
- <PlatformLink to="/data-management/debug-files/source-context">Source Context</PlatformLink> shows code snippets around stack frames

### Other Features

- Session tracking for release health metrics
- <Link to="/product/releases/health">Release health</Link> tracks crash-free users and sessions
- Offline caching when a device is unable to connect; we send a report once we receive another event
- Swift Async/Await support for automatically stitching together stack traces of Swift concurrency code
- Logs capturing available (requires `enableLogs` option)
