TODO: ADD SOME PICS

Size Analysis Insights point out how iOS app can reduce its size. They spot patterns like duplicate files, oversized media, or unneeded assets, and list exactly what to fix along with the estimated size savings.

## iOS Insights

Below are a list of available insights for iOS builds.

| Insight                     | What it catches                                                                             |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Duplicate files             | Flags identical payloads you can keep once and drop the copies.                             |
| Large videos                | Highlights video files that are bigger than typical delivery budgets.                       |
| Image optimization          | Surfaces oversized PNG/JPEG/HEIC assets and recommends recompressing or converting to HEIC. |
| Alternate icon optimization | Checks alternate app icons for downscaling and recompressing.                               |
| Loose images                | Groups @1x/@2x/@3x variants that should move into asset catalogs.                           |
| Small files                 | Totals tiny files wasting space because of 4 KB filesystem blocks.                          |
| Strip binary                | Shows binaries that still include removable debug sections or symbols.                      |
| Localized strings           | Estimates savings from shrinking `.strings` payloads.                                       |
| Minify localized strings    | Measures wins from stripping comments in `.strings` files.                                  |
| Main binary export metadata | Reports export tries on main binaries that are larger than needed.                          |
| Unnecessary files           | Catches docs, scripts, configs, or other build leftovers in the bundle.                     |
| Hermes debug info (RN only) | Points to bundled Hermes bytecode still carrying debuggers' metadata                        |
