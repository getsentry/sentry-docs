[Size Analysis](/product/size-analysis) helps you monitor your mobile app's size in preprod to prevent size regressions from reaching users. Aside from being courteous to your users, a smaller app size helps boost conversion and retention rates for the long-tail of customers.

## Getting Started

**Accepted Formats**: XCArchive (preferred) | IPA

**Upload Mechanisms**: [Fastlane Plugin](#uploading-with-fastlane) | [Sentry CLI](#uploading-with-the-sentry-cli)

### Uploading with Fastlane

<Include name="size-analysis/upload-fastlane" />

### Uploading with the Sentry CLI

## Upload Metadata

### Build Configuration
