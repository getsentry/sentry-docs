Install groups let you tag builds with one or more group names to control update visibility between builds. See the [product documentation](/product/build-distribution/#install-groups) for a full explanation of how install groups work.

## Uploading With Install Groups

### Sentry CLI

Pass `--install-group` one or more times:

```bash
sentry-cli build upload app.xcarchive \
  --org your-org \
  --project your-project \
  --build-configuration Release \
  --install-group alpha \
  --install-group staging
```

### Fastlane Plugin

Pass the `install_groups` parameter:

```ruby {filename:Fastfile}
sentry_upload_build(
  org_slug: 'your-org',
  project_slug: 'your-project',
  xcarchive_path: 'path/to/YourApp.xcarchive',
  build_configuration: 'Release',
  install_groups: ['alpha', 'staging']
)
```
