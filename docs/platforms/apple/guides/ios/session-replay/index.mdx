<Note>

Mobile support for Session Replay is in Beta. Features available in Beta are still work-in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.

If you have any questions, feedback or would like to report a bug, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Platform%3A+Cocoa%2CType%3A+Bug&projects=&template=bug.yml) with a link to a relevant replay in Sentry if possible.

</Note>

[Session Replay](/product/explore/session-replay/) helps you get to the root cause of an error or latency issue faster by providing you with a reproduction of what was happening in the user's device before, during, and after the issue. You can rewind and replay your application's state and see key user interactions, like taps, swipes, network requests, and console entries, in a single UI.

By default, our Session Replay SDK masks all text content, images, and user input, giving you heightened confidence that no sensitive data will leave the device. To learn more, see [product docs](/product/explore/session-replay/).

## Pre-requisites

Make sure your Sentry Cocoa SDK version is at least 8.31.1

## Install

If you already have the SDK installed, you can update it to the latest version with:

```swift {tabTitle:SPM}
.package(url: "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa", from: "{{@inject packages.version('sentry.cocoa') }}"),
```

```ruby {tabTitle:CocoaPods}
pod update
```

```ruby {tabTitle:Carthage}
github "getsentry/sentry-cocoa" "{{@inject packages.version('sentry.cocoa') }}"
```

## Set Up

To set up the integration, add the following to your Sentry initialization.

```swift
SentrySDK.start(configureOptions: { options in
  options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
  options.debug = true

  // Currently under experimental options:
  options.experimental.sessionReplay.onErrorSampleRate = 1.0
  options.experimental.sessionReplay.sessionSampleRate = 1.0
})
```

## Verify

While you're testing, we recommend that you set `sessionSampleRate` to `1.0`. This ensures that every user session will be sent to Sentry.

Once testing is complete, **we recommend lowering this value in production**. We still recommend keeping `onErrorSampleRate` set to `1.0`.

## Sampling

Sampling allows you to control how much of your website's traffic will result in a Session Replay. There are two sample rates you can adjust to get the replays relevant to you:

1. `sessionSampleRate` - The sample rate for
   replays that begin recording immediately and last the entirety of the user's session.
2. `onErrorSampleRate` - The sample rate for
   replays that are recorded when an error happens. This type of replay will record
   up to a minute of events prior to the error and continue recording until the session
   ends.

Sampling begins as soon as a session starts. `sessionSampleRate` is evaluated first. If it's sampled, the replay recording will begin. Otherwise, `onErrorSampleRate` is evaluated and if it's sampled, the integration will begin buffering the replay and will only upload it to Sentry if an error occurs. The remainder of the replay will behave similarly to a whole-session replay.

## Privacy

The SDK aggressively records the app and masks all text and images. 
Please don't turn it off if you have sensitive data in your app. 
If you want to manually mask parts of your app's data, read our guide on [custom masking](/platforms/apple/guides/ios/session-replay/customredact).

<Note>

If you encounter any data not being redacted with the default settings, please let us know through a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Platform%3A+Cocoa%2CType%3A+Bug&projects=&template=bug.yml).

</Note>

To disable redaction altogether (not to be used on applications with sensitive data):

```swift
options.experimental.sessionReplay.redactAllText = false
options.experimental.sessionReplay.redactAllImages = false
```

## Error Linking

Errors that happen on the page while a replay is running will be linked to the replay, making it possible to jump between related issues and replays. However, it's **possible** that in some cases the error count reported on the **Replays Details** page won't match the actual errors that have been captured. That's because errors can be lost, and while this is uncommon, there are a few reasons why it could happen:

- The replay was rate-limited and couldn't be accepted.
- The replay was deleted by a member of your org.
- There were network errors and the replay wasn't saved.

### FAQ

Q: Does Session Replay work with SwiftUI?
A: Yes. It works with both UIKit and SwiftUI.

Q: What's the lowest version of iOS supported?
A: Session Replay recording happens even on the lowest version supported by the Sentry SDK. (Today that's iOS 12.)
