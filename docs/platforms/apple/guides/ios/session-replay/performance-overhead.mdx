If you're considering enabling Session Replay, it's important to first understand the potential performance impact to your app. While accurate metrics require realistic testing where you apply typical access patterns and correlate the results with your business metrics, to provide a baseline, we measured the overhead using the open-source [Pocket Casts](https://github.com/Automattic/pocket-casts-ios) app.

You can learn more about the various performance overhead optimizations implemented in the iOS Replay SDK in the [Replay Performance Overhead](/product/explore/session-replay/mobile/performance-overhead/) docs.

## Benchmarking the iOS Replay SDK

The Pocket Casts app offers a diverse mix of components making it an ideal candidate for testing. Here's how the benchmarks were conducted:

- **Configuration:** Full masking was enabled, and optimized release builds were used.
- **User Flow:** The same flow was executed 10 times to ensure consistency.
- **Real-World Representation:** This approach closely mirrors performance in real-world scenarios.

The benchmarks were run on an iPhone 14 Pro. Note that active Session Replay recording can introduce slow frames on older lower-end iOS devices (for example iPhone 8).

### Results

Below are the results of the benchmarking tests, presented as median values to reflect typical overhead.

| Metric                  | Sentry SDK only | Sentry + Replay SDK  |
| ----------------------- | --------------- | -------------------- |
| FPS                     | 55 fps          | 53 fps               |
| Memory                  | 102 MB          | 121 MB               |
| CPU                     | 4%              | 13%                  |
| App Startup Time (Cold) | 1264.80 ms      | 1265 ms              |
| Main Thread Time        | n/a             | 43ms                 |
| Network Bandwidth       | n/a             | 10 KB/s of recording |

## Reducing Performance Overhead

To minimize the performance impact of the Replay SDK, consider the following steps:

### Change Replay quality

Lowering the quality of captured screenshots and videos can significantly reduce CPU, memory, and network bandwidth usage. Here's how you can do it:

```swift
SentrySDK.start(configureOptions: { options in
  // this will reduce screenshot compression to 10 and bitrate to 50kbps
  options.sessionReplay.quality = .low // defaults to .medium
})
```

### Disable Replay for Low-End Devices

If the Replay SDK causes performance issues on lower-end devices (for example, [this](https://github.com/getsentry/relay/blob/695b459e03481f7d799f07b2b901b140e5d5753d/relay-event-schema/src/protocol/device_class.rs#L21-L37) is how Sentry determines the device class), you can disable it specifically for those devices:

```swift
SentrySDK.start(configureOptions: { options in
  options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
  options.debug = true

  options.sessionReplay.onErrorSampleRate = if isLowEnd() { 0.0 } else { 1.0 }
  options.sessionReplay.sessionSampleRate = if isLowEnd() { 0.0 } else { 0.1 }
})
```

### Enable Experimental View Renderer

<Alert>
  In case you are noticing issues with the experimental view renderer, please
  report the issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa).
</Alert>

Starting with v8.47.0 you can enable the up to 5x faster new view renderer, reducing the impact of Session Replay on the main thread and potential frame drops.

While we do recommend the new view renderer, it is currently considered an experimental feature to further evaluate its stability.
After the evaluation phase we are going to enable it by default and eventually replace the default implementation with it in the near future.

```swift
SentrySDK.start(configureOptions: { options in
  options.sessionReplay.enableExperimentalViewRenderer = true
})
```

### Enable Fast (Incomplete) View Rendering

In addition to the experimental view renderer we offer the option of even faster, but potentially incomplete, view renderering.

This option only works in combination with the experimental view renderer and controls the way the view hierarchy is drawn.
By default, the view hierarchy is drawn using the method `UIView.drawHierarchy(in:afterScreenUpdates:)`, which can be slow but brings is the most complete way to render the view hierarchy.

By enabling this flag the view is directly rendered using the underlying `CALayer.render(in:)` instead.
While this appraoch can show performance benefits, it can also lead to rendering issues and incomplete UI snapshots.

We recommended to leave this option set to `false`.
In case you prefer performance over completeness, you can set this option to `true`.

```swift
SentrySDK.start(configureOptions: { options in
  options.sessionReplay.enableExperimentalViewRenderer = true

  // Enable faster but incomplete view rendering
  options.sessionReplay.enableFastViewRendering = true
})
```
