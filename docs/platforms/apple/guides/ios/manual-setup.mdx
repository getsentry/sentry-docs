If you can't (or prefer not to) run the [automatic setup](/platforms/apple/guides/ios/#install), you can follow the instructions below to configure your application manually.

## Installation

The minimum required version for iOS is 11.0.

We recommend installing the SDK with CocoaPods, but we also support alternate [installation methods](/platforms/apple/guides/ios/install/). To integrate Sentry into your Xcode project, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby {filename:Podfile}
platform :ios, '11.0'
use_frameworks! # This is important

target 'YourApp' do
  pod 'Sentry', :git => 'https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa.git', :tag => '{{@inject packages.version('sentry.cocoa') }}'
end
```

Then run `pod install`.

## Configuration

We recommend initializing the SDK on the main thread as soon as possible â€“ in your AppDelegate `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method, for example:


```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry // Make sure you import Sentry

// ....

func application(_ application: UIApplication,
    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {

    SentrySDK.start { options in
        options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
        options.debug = true // Enabled debug when first installing is always helpful
    }

    return true
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {

    [SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
        options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";
        options.debug = YES; // Enabled debug when first installing is always helpful

        // Enable tracing to capture 100% of transactions for tracing.
        // Use 'options.tracesSampleRate' to set the sampling rate.
        // We recommend setting a sample rate in production.
        options.enableTracing = YES;
    }];

    return YES;
}
```

If you're using SwiftUI and your app doesn't implement an app delegate, initialize the SDK within the [App conformer's initializer](<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/app/main()>):


```swift
import Sentry

@main
struct SwiftUIApp: App {
    init() {
        SentrySDK.start { options in
            options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
            options.debug = true // Enabled debug when first installing is always helpful

            // Enable tracing to capture 100% of transactions for tracing.
            // Use 'options.tracesSampleRate' to set the sampling rate.
            // We recommend setting a sample rate in production.
            options.enableTracing = true
        }
    }
}
```
