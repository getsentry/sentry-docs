Sentry's Apple SDK for iOS enables automatic reporting of errors and exceptions, and identifies performance issues in your application. All features listed below are **enabled by default** unless otherwise noted.

<Alert>

The SDK builds a crash report that persists to disk. On iOS, crash reports are sent on the next app launch, not immediately after the crash, because iOS only allows async-safe code during crashes and network requests are not async-safe.

</Alert>

For a complete list of all available features, see the <PlatformLink to="/features">main Features page</PlatformLink>. This page highlights iOS-specific features and capabilities.

## Error Detection Features

iOS supports comprehensive error detection:

- Crash detection for all types of crashes and exceptions
- <PlatformLink to="/configuration/app-hangs/">App hang detection</PlatformLink> for when the app becomes unresponsive
- <PlatformLink to="/configuration/watchdog-terminations/">Watchdog termination tracking</PlatformLink> for abnormal process terminations
- <PlatformLink to="/configuration/http-client-errors">HTTP client errors</PlatformLink> automatically captured

## Event Enrichment

- Events <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/context">enriched</PlatformLink> with device data, environment information, and app state
- <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/#automatic-breadcrumbs">Breadcrumbs are automatically</PlatformLink> captured for app lifecycle, touch events, system events, and network requests
- <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/attachments">Attachments</PlatformLink> for storing additional files with events
- <PlatformLink to="/data-management/debug-files/source-context">Source Context</PlatformLink> shows code snippets around stack frames
- <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/screenshots">Screenshot</PlatformLink> capture when errors occur
- <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/viewhierarchy">View Hierarchy</PlatformLink> capture when errors occur

## Logs

<PlatformLink to="/logs">Logs capturing</PlatformLink> is available and requires the `enableLogs` option to be enabled.

## Performance Features Available on iOS

iOS supports all <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation">performance monitoring</PlatformLink> features:

- <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#prewarmed-app-start-tracing">App start tracking</PlatformLink> for cold and warm app start times
- <Link to="/product/insights/mobile/mobile-vitals">Frame rate tracking</Link> for UI rendering performance and slow/frozen frame identification
- <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#user-interaction-tracing">User interaction tracking</PlatformLink> that automatically creates transactions for UI interactions
- <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#network-tracking">Network request monitoring</PlatformLink> for HTTP request performance
- <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#file-io-tracing">File I/O performance tracking</PlatformLink> for file operations
- <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#core-data-tracing">Core Data performance tracking</PlatformLink> for Core Data query performance

## iOS-Specific Features

### Session Replay

<PlatformLink to="/session-replay">Session Replay</PlatformLink> records user sessions for visual debugging, helping you understand what happened before, during, and after an error.

- Available on iOS 16+
- Requires SDK version 8.31.1 or later
- Requires enabling the `enableSessionReplay` option

<Alert level="warning">

Session Replay is automatically disabled on iOS 26.0+ when built with Xcode 26.0+ to prevent potential PII leaks due to Apple's Liquid Glass rendering changes. See the <PlatformLink to="/session-replay/troubleshooting">Session Replay troubleshooting guide</PlatformLink> for details.

</Alert>

## Other Features

- <PlatformLink to="/configuration/metric-kit">MetricKit integration</PlatformLink> available on iOS 15+ (requires `enableMetricKit` option)
- <Link to="/product/releases/health">Release health</Link> tracks crash-free users and sessions
- Swift Async/Await support for automatically stitching together stack traces of Swift concurrency code

## User Feedback UI

<PlatformLink to="/user-feedback">User Feedback</PlatformLink> provides a built-in UI to collect user information when an error occurs. You must call the User Feedback API to display the UI.

- Requires calling the User Feedback API to show the UI

For configuration options and detailed documentation, see the <PlatformLink to="/configuration">Configuration</PlatformLink> section.
