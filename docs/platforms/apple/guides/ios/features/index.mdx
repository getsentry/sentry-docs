Sentry's Apple SDK for iOS enables automatic reporting of errors and exceptions, and identifies performance issues in your application. All features listed below are **enabled by default** unless otherwise noted.

<Alert>

The SDK builds a crash report that persists to disk. While it attempts to send the report right after the crash, it may not always work because the environment may be unstable at the time of the crash. If this is the case, the report will be sent upon application start.

</Alert>

For a complete list of all available features, see the <PlatformLink to="/common/features">main Features page</PlatformLink>. This page highlights iOS-specific features and capabilities.

## iOS-Specific Features

### Session Replay

<PlatformLink to="/common/session-replay">Session Replay</PlatformLink> records user sessions for visual debugging, helping you understand what happened before, during, and after an error.

- Available on iOS 16+
- Requires SDK version 8.31.1 or later
- Enabled by default (when conditions are met)

<Alert level="warning">

Session Replay is automatically disabled on iOS 26.0+ when built with Xcode 26.0+ to prevent potential PII leaks due to Apple's Liquid Glass rendering changes. See the <PlatformLink to="/common/session-replay/troubleshooting">Session Replay troubleshooting guide</PlatformLink> for details.

</Alert>

### User Feedback UI

<PlatformLink to="/user-feedback">User Feedback</PlatformLink> provides a built-in UI to collect user information when an error occurs.

- Available on iOS 13+
- Enabled by default

### Screenshot Capture

Automatically captures screenshots when errors occur to help with debugging. See the <PlatformLink to="/guides/ios/enriching-events/screenshots">Screenshot documentation</PlatformLink> for configuration options.

### View Hierarchy Capture

Captures the complete view hierarchy when errors occur, providing visual context for debugging. See the <PlatformLink to="/guides/ios/enriching-events/viewhierarchy">View Hierarchy documentation</PlatformLink> for configuration options.

## Performance Features Available on iOS

## Error Detection Features

iOS supports comprehensive error detection:

- Crash detection for all types of crashes and exceptions
- <PlatformLink to="/configuration/app-hangs/">App hang detection</PlatformLink> for when the app becomes unresponsive
- <PlatformLink to="/configuration/watchdog-terminations/">Watchdog termination tracking</PlatformLink> for out-of-memory terminations
- <PlatformLink to="/configuration/http-client-errors">HTTP client errors</PlatformLink> automatically captured
