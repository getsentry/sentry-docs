Sentry's Apple SDK for macOS enables automatic reporting of errors and exceptions, and identifies performance issues in your application. The minimum supported macOS version is 10.10. The below, is a list of features that are available as part of this SDK.

<Note>

For macOS, a simple [manual setup](/platforms/apple/guides/macos/usage/#capturing-uncaught-exceptions-in-macos) is required for the SDK to report uncaught exceptions.

</Note>

<Note>

The SDK builds a crash report that persists to disk. While it attempts to send the report right after the crash, it may not always work because the environment may be unstable at the time of the crash. If this is the case, the report will be sent upon application start. 

</Note>


**Features:**

- Multiple types of errors are captured, including:
  - Mach exceptions
  - Fatal signals
  - Unhandled exceptions
  - C++ exceptions
  - Objective-C exceptions
  - Error messages of fatalError, assert, and precondition
  - Start-up crashes. The SDK init waits synchronously for up to 5 seconds to flush out events if the app crashes within 2 seconds after the SDK init.
- Events [enriched](/platforms/apple/enriching-events/context/) with device data
- Offline caching when a device is unable to connect; we send a report once we receive another event
- [Breadcrumbs automatically](/platforms/apple/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/#automatic-breadcrumbs) captured for
  - Application lifecycle events (`didBecomeActive`, `didEnterBackground`)
  - Touch events
  - System events (battery level or state changed, memory warnings, device orientation changed, keyboard did show and did hide, screenshot taken)
  - Outgoing HTTP requests
  {/* <!-- When adding an auto breadcrumb item here please also update /platform-includes/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/automatic-breadcrumbs/apple.mdx --> */}
- [Release health](/product/releases/health/) tracks crash free users and sessions
- [Attachments](/platforms/apple/enriching-events/attachments/) enrich your event by storing additional files, such as config or log files
- [User Feedback](/platforms/apple/user-feedback/) provides the ability to collect user information when an event occurs
- [Source Context](/platforms/apple/data-management/debug-files/source-context/) shows snippets of code around the location of stack frames
