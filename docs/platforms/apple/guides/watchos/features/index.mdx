Sentry's Apple SDK for watchOS enables basic reporting of errors and exceptions with limited symbolication support and no crash or app hang detection. All features listed below are **enabled by default** unless otherwise noted.

<Alert level="warning">

watchOS has significant limitations compared to other Apple platforms. Crash detection, app hang detection, and many performance monitoring features are not available due to platform restrictions.

</Alert>

For a complete list of all available features, see the <PlatformLink to="/features">main Features page</PlatformLink>. This page highlights watchOS-specific features and limitations.

## watchOS Limitations

watchOS has significant limitations due to platform restrictions:

- Crash detection not available (no crash handling)
- App hang detection not available
- Watchdog terminations not available
- Session Replay not available
- User Feedback UI not available
- Screenshot capture not available
- View Hierarchy capture not available
- Profiling not available
- MetricKit integration not available
- Logs capturing not available
- Most performance monitoring features not available
- Limited symbolication support

## Available Features on watchOS

Despite the limitations, watchOS still supports several useful features:

### Error Reporting

- Manual error reporting using <PlatformLink to="/usage">SentrySDK.capture(error:)</PlatformLink> or `SentrySDK.capture(message:)`
- Handled exceptions can be captured and reported

### Event Enrichment

- Events <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/context">enriched</PlatformLink> with device data and environment information
- <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/attachments">Attachments</PlatformLink> enrich your event by storing additional files, such as config or log files
- <PlatformLink to="/data-management/debug-files/source-context">Source Context</PlatformLink> shows snippets of code around the location of stack frames (when available)

### Session & User Tracking

- Session tracking for release health metrics (limited functionality)
- <Link to="/product/releases/health">Release health</Link> tracking (limited by lack of crash detection)

### Data Management

- Offline caching when a device is unable to connect; we send a report once we receive another event
- Event persistence: events persist to disk and are sent when connectivity is available

### Other Features

- Swift Async/Await support for automatically stitching together stack traces of Swift concurrency code (when applicable)
- <PlatformLink to="/user-feedback">User Feedback</PlatformLink> via programmatic API (no UI available)

## Best Practices for watchOS

Given the limitations on watchOS:

1. **Use Manual Error Reporting** - Since crash detection is not available, use <PlatformLink to="/usage">SentrySDK.capture(error:)</PlatformLink> to manually report important errors
2. **Add Context** - Use <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/scopes">scopes</PlatformLink> to add context and <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/tags">tags</PlatformLink> to help debug issues
3. **Test Thoroughly** - Since symbolication is limited, ensure your error messages and context are descriptive
4. **Consider Companion App** - For critical error tracking, consider implementing error reporting in your companion <Link to="/platforms/apple/guides/ios">iOS app</Link>
