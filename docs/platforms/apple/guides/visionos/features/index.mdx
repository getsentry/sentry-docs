Sentry's Apple SDK for visionOS enables automatic reporting of errors and exceptions, and identifies performance issues in your application. All features listed below are **enabled by default** unless otherwise noted.

<PlatformSection supported={["apple.visionos"]}>

<Alert level="info" title="Experimental Support">

The support for [visionOS](https://developer.apple.com/visionos/) is currently experimental, which means it may have bugs. We recognize the irony.

</Alert>

</PlatformSection>

<Alert>

The SDK builds a crash report that persists to disk. While it attempts to send the report right after the crash, it may not always work because the environment may be unstable at the time of the crash. If this is the case, the report will be sent upon application start.

</Alert>

For a complete list of all available features, see the <PlatformLink to="/common/features">main Features page</PlatformLink>. This page highlights visionOS-specific features and limitations.

## visionOS Limitations

visionOS has some limitations compared to iOS:

- Session Replay not available
- User Feedback UI not available
- Screenshot capture not available
- Profiling not available
- MetricKit integration not available

## Available Features on visionOS

### Performance Monitoring

visionOS supports comprehensive performance monitoring:

- App start tracking for cold and warm app start times
- Frame rate tracking for UI rendering performance and slow/frozen frame identification
- User interaction tracking that automatically creates transactions for UI interactions
- Network request monitoring for HTTP request performance
- File I/O performance tracking for file operations
- Core Data performance tracking for Core Data query performance

### Error Detection

visionOS supports comprehensive error detection:

- Crash detection for all types of crashes and exceptions
- <PlatformLink to="/configuration/app-hangs/">App hang detection</PlatformLink> for when the app becomes unresponsive
- <PlatformLink to="/configuration/http-client-errors">HTTP client errors</PlatformLink> automatically captured

### Event Enrichment

- <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/#automatic-breadcrumbs">Breadcrumbs automatically</PlatformLink> captured for app lifecycle, system events, and network requests
- Events <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/context">enriched</PlatformLink> with device and environment data
- <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/attachments">Attachments</PlatformLink> for storing additional files with events
- <PlatformLink to="/data-management/debug-files/source-context">Source Context</PlatformLink> shows code snippets around stack frames

### Other Features

- Session tracking for release health metrics
- <Link to="/product/releases/health">Release health</Link> tracks crash-free users and sessions
- Offline caching when a device is unable to connect; we send a report once we receive another event
- Swift Async/Await support for automatically stitching together stack traces of Swift concurrency code
- Logs capturing available (requires `enableLogs` option)
