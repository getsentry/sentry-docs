## Enable Tracing

Profiling depends on Sentryâ€™s Tracing product being enabled beforehand. To enable tracing in the SDK:

<SignInNote />

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    options.tracesSampleRate = 1.0
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    options.tracesSampleRate = @1.0;
}];
```

Check out the <PlatformLink to="/tracing/">tracing setup documentation</PlatformLink> for more detailed information on how to configure sampling. Setting the sample rate to 1.0 means all transactions will be captured.

By default, some transactions will be created automatically for common operations like loading a view controller/activity and app startup.

## Enable Profiling

<Note>

iOS profiling is available starting in SDK version `8.12.0`.

</Note>

<SignInNote />

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    options.tracesSampleRate = 1.0 // tracing must be enabled for profiling
    options.profilesSampleRate = 1.0 // see also `profilesSampler` if you need custom sampling logic
    options.enableAppLaunchProfiling = true // experimental new feature to start profiling in the pre-main launch phase
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    options.tracesSampleRate = @1.0; // tracing must be enabled for profiling
    options.profilesSampleRate = @1.0; // see also `profilesSampler` if you need custom sampling logic
    options.enableAppLaunchProfiling = YES; // experimental new feature to start profiling in the pre-main launch phase
}];
```

<Note>

The <PlatformIdentifier name="profiles-sample-rate" /> setting is _relative_ to the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> setting.

## Enable Launch Profiling

<Note>

This feature is experimental and may have bugs.

_(New in version 8.21.0)_

Normally, a profile can only be taken during a trace span after the SDK has been initialized. Now, you can configure the SDK to automatically profile certain app launches.

To set up launch profiling, use the `enableAppLaunchProfiling` option and configure the sample rates for traces and profiles with `SentrySDK.startWithOptions` to determine if the subsequent app launch should be automatically profiled. This allows you to gather information on what is going on in your app even before `main` is called, making it easier to diagnose issues with slow app launches.

If you use `SentryOptions.tracesSampler` or `SentryOptions.profilesSampler`, it will be invoked after you call `SentrySDK.startWithOptions`, with `SentryTransactionContext.forNextAppLaunch` set to `true` indicating that it's evaluating a launch profile sampling decision. If instead you simply set `SentryOptions.tracesSampleRate` and `SentryOptions.profilesSampleRate`, those numerical rates will be used directly.

Currently, launch profiles are attached to a special performance transaction operation called `app.launch` and displayed in the product simply as `launch`.
