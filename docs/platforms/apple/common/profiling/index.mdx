## Enable UI Profiling

<Alert>

UI Profiling was introduced in SDK version 8.49.0. All prior profiling API are deprecated and will be removed in a future major version of the SDK.

</Alert>

To configure profiling, assign a closure to `SentryOptions.configureProfiling`, setting the desired options on the object passed in as parameter:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    options.configureProfiling = {
        $0.sessionSampleRate = 1
    }
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    options.configureProfiling = ^(SentryProfileOptions *profiling) {
        profiling.sessionSampleRate = 1.f;
    };
}];
```

By default, `sessionSampleRate` is `0`, so you'll need to set it to a higher value to receive profile data. `sessionSampleRate` is evaluated once per user session and applies to any attempt to start a profile until the next user session starts. See <PlatformLink to="/configuration/releases/#sessions">user session documentation</PlatformLink> for more information on user sessions. 

See the subsections below to learn about the various ways the profiler can be started and stopped.

### Manual Lifecycle

By default, the profiler can only be started and stopped manually with calls to `SentrySDK.startProfiler` and `SentrySDK.stopProfiler`. All code that executes on all threads in between those calls will be recorded. The snippets above demonstrate configuring manual profiling mode.

For example, if you wanted to profile everything that happens after starting a network request, and then update a table view with the contents of the response, you could do it like this (assuming you've already started the Sentry SDK with the options shown above):

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

struct MyModel: Codable {
    // fields...
}
var model: MyModel?
var tableView: UITableView!

@IBAction func updateTable() {
    SentrySDK.startProfiler()
    URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: URLRequest(url: URL(string: "https://my.domain.tld/endpoint")!)) { data, response, error in
        self.model = try! JSONDecoder().decode(MyModel.self, from: data!)
        DispatchQueue.main.async {
            self.tableView.performBatchUpdates {
                // update table view with model
            } completion: { finished in 
                SentrySDK.stopProfiler()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This would capture every stacktrace on every thread involved with performing the network request, decoding the response and rebuilding the cells in the table view.

### Trace Lifecycle

The profiler can be configured to start when a new root span is started where none already exist, and stopped when there are no root spans remaining. For this mode, you must set the `SentryProfileOptions.lifecycle` property to `SentryProfileLifecycleTrace` and ensure some traces will be sampled:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    options.tracesSampleRate = 1
    options.configureProfiling = {
        $0.sessionSampleRate = 1
        $0.lifecycle = .trace
    }
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    options.tracesSampleRate = @1.f;
    options.configureProfiling = ^(SentryProfileOptions *profiling) {
        profiling.sessionSampleRate = 1.f;
        profiling.lifecycle = SentryProfileLifecycleTrace;
    };
}];
```

<Alert>

The `sessionSampleRate` for profiles is _relative_ to the `tracesSampleRate`: if `tracesSampleRate` and `sessionSampleRate` are both `0.5`, then on average 25% of attempts to start the profiler will result in actual data collection.

</Alert>

Check out the <PlatformLink to="/tracing/">tracing setup documentation</PlatformLink> for more detailed information on how to configure sampling for Sentry Tracing.

### App Starts

If configured with manual lifecycle, a profile starts on the next app launch, and continues until you call `SentrySDK.stopProfiler`. 

If configured with trace lifecycle, app start profiles are attached to a special performance transaction operation called `app.launch` and displayed in the product as `launch`. It is stopped either when `SentrySDK.startWithOptions` is called, or, if <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#time-to-initial-display">Time to Initial Display (TTID)</PlatformLink>/<PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#time-to-full-display">Time to Full Display (TTFD)</PlatformLink> tracking is enabled, when the SDK determines that TTID/TTFD has been reached.

Every time `SentrySDK.startWithOptions` is called with app start profiling configured, a separate sample decision is generated with `sessionSampleRate` and stored until the next app launch (as well as `tracesSampleRate` if trace profile lifecycle is configured). The same sample decision will apply for the remainder of the profile session following that subsequent launch.

## Transaction-based Profiling (deprecated)

<Alert>

Profiling configuration, explained below, was originally introduced in SDK version `8.12.0`. It is now deprecated in favor of UI Profiling, introduced in 8.49.0.

</Alert>

<Alert>

Transaction-based Profiling depends on Sentryâ€™s Tracing product being enabled beforehand. Check out the <PlatformLink to="/tracing/">tracing setup documentation</PlatformLink> for detailed information on how to configure sampling.

</Alert>

Configure the sampling rates for traces and profiles to ensure they are nonzero so that some are recorded. The <PlatformIdentifier name="profiles-sample-rate" /> setting is _relative_ to the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> setting.

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    options.tracesSampleRate = 1.0 // tracing must be enabled for profiling
    options.profilesSampleRate = 1.0 // see also `profilesSampler` if you need custom sampling logic
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    options.tracesSampleRate = @1.0; // tracing must be enabled for profiling
    options.profilesSampleRate = @1.0; // see also `profilesSampler` if you need custom sampling logic
}];
```

## Launch Profiling (deprecated)

<Alert>

Launch profiling configuration, explained below, was originally introduced in SDK version 8.21.0. It is now deprecated in favor of UI Profiling, released in 8.49.0.

</Alert>

Normally, a profile can only be taken during a trace span after the SDK has been initialized. Now, you can configure the SDK to automatically profile certain app launches.

To set up launch profiling, use the `enableAppLaunchProfiling` option and configure the sample rates for traces and profiles with `SentrySDK.startWithOptions` to determine if the subsequent app launch should be automatically profiled. This allows you to gather information on what is going on in your app even before `main` is called, making it easier to diagnose issues with slow app launches.

If you use `SentryOptions.tracesSampler` or `SentryOptions.profilesSampler`, it will be invoked after you call `SentrySDK.startWithOptions`, with `SentryTransactionContext.forNextAppLaunch` set to `true` indicating that it's evaluating a launch profile sampling decision. If instead you simply set `SentryOptions.tracesSampleRate` and `SentryOptions.profilesSampleRate`, those numerical rates will be used directly.

Currently, launch profiles are attached to a special performance transaction operation called `app.launch` and displayed in the product simply as `launch`.

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    options.tracesSampleRate = 1.0 // tracing must be enabled for profiling
    options.profilesSampleRate = 1.0 // see also `profilesSampler` if you need custom sampling logic
    options.enableAppLaunchProfiling = true
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    options.tracesSampleRate = @1.0; // tracing must be enabled for profiling
    options.profilesSampleRate = @1.0; // see also `profilesSampler` if you need custom sampling logic
    options.enableAppLaunchProfiling = YES;
}];
```

## Continuous Profiling Beta (deprecated)

<Alert>

Continuous Profiling Beta, explained below, was originally introduced in SDK version 8.36.0. It is now deprecated in favor of UI Profiling, released in 8.49.0.

</Alert>

The current profiling implementation stops the profiler automatically after 30 seconds (unless you manually stop it earlier). Naturally, this limitation makes it difficult to get full coverage of your app's execution. We now offer an experimental continuous mode, where profiling data is periodically uploaded while running, with no limit to how long the profiler may run.

Previously, profiles only ran in tandem with performance transactions that were started either automatically or manually with `SentrySDK.startTransaction`. Now, you can start and stop the profiler directly with `SentrySDK.startProfiler` and `SentrySDK.stopProfiler`. You can also start a profile at app launch by setting `SentryOptions.enableAppLaunchProfiling = true` in your call to `SentrySDK.startWithOptions`.

Continuous profiling mode is enabled by default, requiring no changes to `SentryOptions` when you start the SDK to opt in. If you had previously set `SentryOptions.profilesSampleRate` or `SentryOptions.profilesSampler` to use transaction-based profiling, then remove those lines of code from your configuration.

These new APIs do not offer any sampling functionalityâ€”every call to start the profiler will start it, and the same goes for launch profiles if you've configured that. If you are interested in reducing the amount of profiles that run, you must take care to do it at the call sites.

Continuous profiling has implications for your org's billing structure. This feature is only available for subscription plans that enrolled after June 5, 2024.
