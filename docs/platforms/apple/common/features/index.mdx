---

Sentry's Apple SDK enables automatic reporting of errors and exceptions, and identifies performance issues in your application.

<Alert>

The SDK builds a crash report that persists to disk. While it attempts to send the report right after the crash, it may not always work because the environment may be unstable at the time of the crash. If this is the case, the report will be sent upon application start.

</Alert>

All features listed below are **enabled by default** unless otherwise noted. Some features have platform-specific limitations or version requirements, which are indicated where applicable.

## Error & Crash Detection

- Multiple types of errors are captured, including:
  - Mach exceptions
  - Fatal signals
  - Unhandled exceptions
  - C++ exceptions
  - Objective-C exceptions
  - Error messages of `fatalError`, `assert`, and `precondition`
  - Start-up crashes. The SDK init waits synchronously for up to 5 seconds to flush out events if the app crashes within 2 seconds after the SDK init.

## Data Management

- Offline caching when a device is unable to connect; we send a report once we receive another event
- Event persistence: crash reports persist to disk and are sent upon application start if not sent immediately after a crash
