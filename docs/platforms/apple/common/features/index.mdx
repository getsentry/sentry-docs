Sentry's Apple SDK enables automatic reporting of errors and exceptions, and identifies performance issues in your application.

<Note>

The SDK builds a crash report that persists to disk. While it attempts to send the report right after the crash, it may not always work because the environment may be unstable at the time of the crash. If this is the case, the report will be sent upon application start.

</Note>


**Features:**

- Multiple types of errors are captured, including:
  - Mach exceptions
  - Fatal signals
  - Unhandled exceptions
  - C++ exceptions
  - Objective-C exceptions
  - Error messages of fatalError, assert, and precondition
  - <PlatformLink to="/configuration/app-hangs/">App Hang Detection</PlatformLink>
  - <PlatformLink to="/configuration/watchdog-terminations/"> Watchdog Terminations</PlatformLink>
  - <PlatformLink to="/configuration/http-client-errors">HTTP Client Errors</PlatformLink>
  - Start-up crashes. The SDK init waits synchronously for up to 5 seconds to flush out events if the app crashes within 2 seconds after the SDK init.
- Events <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/context">enriched</PlatformLink> with device data
- Offline caching when a device is unable to connect; we send a report once we receive another event
- <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/#automatic-breadcrumbs">Breadcrumbs automatically</PlatformLink> captured for
  - Application lifecycle events (`didBecomeActive`, `didEnterBackground`, `viewDidAppear`)
  - Touch events
  - System events (battery level or state changed, memory warnings, device orientation changed, keyboard did show and did hide, screenshot taken)
  - Outgoing HTTP requests
- <Link to="/product/releases/health">Release health</Link> tracks crash free users and sessions
- Automatic <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation">Performance Tracking</PlatformLink>
  - Rendering of UIViewControllers

    - <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#prewarmed-app-start-tracing">Prewarmed App Start Tracing</PlatformLink>
  - Performance of <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#file-io-tracing">File I/O</PlatformLink> operations
  - Performance of <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#core-data-tracing">Core Data</PlatformLink> queries
  - <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#user-interaction-tracing">User Interaction</PlatformLink> transactions for UI clicks
- <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/attachments">Attachments</PlatformLink> enrich your event by storing additional files, such as config or log files
- <PlatformLink to="/user-feedback">User Feedback</PlatformLink> provides the ability to collect user information when an event occurs
- <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/viewhierarchy">View Hierarchy</PlatformLink> and <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/screenshots">Screenshot</PlatformLink> attachments for errors
