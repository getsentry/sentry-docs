---

Sentry's Apple SDK enables automatic reporting of errors and exceptions, and identifies performance issues in your application.

<Alert>

The SDK builds a crash report that persists to disk. While it attempts to send the report right after the crash, it may not always work because the environment may be unstable at the time of the crash. If this is the case, the report will be sent upon application start.

</Alert>

All features listed below are **enabled by default** unless otherwise noted. Some features have platform-specific limitations or version requirements, which are indicated where applicable.

## Error & Crash Detection

- Multiple types of errors are captured, including:
  - Mach exceptions
  - Fatal signals
  - Unhandled exceptions
  - C++ exceptions
  - Objective-C exceptions
  - Error messages of `fatalError`, `assert`, and `precondition`
  - Start-up crashes. The SDK init waits synchronously for up to 5 seconds to flush out events if the app crashes within 2 seconds after the SDK init.
- <PlatformLink to="/configuration/app-hangs/">App Hang Detection</PlatformLink>
  - On iOS, tvOS, and visionOS: Differentiates between fully-blocking and non-fully-blocking app hangs, and measures app hang duration (AppHangsV2, enabled by default since SDK version 9.0.0)
- <PlatformLink to="/configuration/watchdog-terminations/">Watchdog Terminations</PlatformLink> (only available on iOS, tvOS, and visionOS)
- <PlatformLink to="/configuration/http-client-errors">HTTP Client Errors</PlatformLink>

## Performance Monitoring

- Automatic <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation">Performance Tracking</PlatformLink> for:
  - Rendering of UIViewControllers
  - Performance of HTTP requests
  - Distributed tracing
  - <Link to="/product/insights/mobile/mobile-vitals">Insights for Mobile Vitals</Link>
    - Cold and warm start
    - Slow and frozen frames
    - <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#prewarmed-app-start-tracing">Prewarmed App Start Tracing</PlatformLink>
  - Performance of <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#file-io-tracing">File I/O</PlatformLink> operations
  - Performance of <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#core-data-tracing">Core Data</PlatformLink> queries
  - <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#user-interaction-tracing">User Interaction</PlatformLink> transactions for UI clicks
  - Frame rate tracking for UI performance (only available on iOS, tvOS, and visionOS)
  - App start time measurement for cold and warm starts (only available on iOS, tvOS, and visionOS)
- <PlatformLink to="/profiling">Profiling</PlatformLink> (requires configuration, only available on iOS and macOS)
  - Transaction-based profiling (deprecated)
  - Continuous profiling
  - UI Profiling (recommended)
  - Launch profiling
- Swift Async/Await support for stitching together stack traces of Swift concurrency code

## Session & User Tracking

- <Link to="/product/releases/health">Release health</Link> tracks crash-free users and sessions
- Session tracking automatically tracks user sessions for release health metrics
- <PlatformLink to="/session-replay">Session Replay</PlatformLink> (only available on iOS 16+ and tvOS 16+)
  - Requires SDK version 8.31.1 or later
  - tvOS is not officially supported

## Event Enrichment

- Events <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/context">enriched</PlatformLink> with device data, environment information, and app state
- <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/#automatic-breadcrumbs">Breadcrumbs are automatically</PlatformLink> captured for:
  - Application lifecycle events (`didBecomeActive`, `didEnterBackground`, `viewDidAppear`)
  - Touch events
  - System events (battery level or state changed, memory warnings, device orientation changed, keyboard did show and did hide, screenshot taken, time zone changed or significant time change)
  - Outgoing HTTP requests
- <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/attachments">Attachments</PlatformLink> enrich your event by storing additional files, such as config or log files
- <PlatformLink to="/data-management/debug-files/source-context">Source Context</PlatformLink> shows snippets of code around the location of stack frames
- <PlatformLink to="/guides/ios/enriching-events/viewhierarchy/">View Hierarchy</PlatformLink> and <PlatformLink to="/guides/ios/enriching-events/screenshots/">Screenshot</PlatformLink> attachments for errors (only available on iOS and tvOS)
- <PlatformLink to="/user-feedback">User Feedback</PlatformLink> provides the ability to collect user information when an event occurs (User Feedback UI only available on iOS 13+)

## Platform-Specific Features

- <PlatformLink to="/configuration/metric-kit">MetricKit</PlatformLink> integration (only available on iOS 15+ and macOS 12+, requires enabling `enableMetricKit` option)
- Logs capturing (requires <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options#enableLogs">`enableLogs`</PlatformLink> option, only available on iOS, tvOS, visionOS, and macOS)

## Data Management

- Offline caching when a device is unable to connect; we send a report once we receive another event
- Event persistence: crash reports persist to disk and are sent upon application start if not sent immediately after a crash
