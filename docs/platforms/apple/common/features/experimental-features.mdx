<Alert>
  Experimental features are still a work-in-progress and may have bugs. We
  recognize the irony.
</Alert>

Experimental features are features that are still being developed and tested. They may have bugs, incomplete functionality, or may change in future releases. Use them at your own risk and provide feedback to help us improve them.

For stable features, see the <PlatformLink to="/features">Features</PlatformLink> page.

## Profiling Features

Profiling features are only available on iOS and macOS.

### App Launch Profiling

Enable <PlatformLink to="/profiling/#enable-launch-profiling">App Launch Profiling</PlatformLink> to get detailed profiles for your app launches.

### Continuous Profiling

Enable <PlatformLink to="/profiling/#continuous-profiling">Continuous Profiling</PlatformLink> to get full coverage of your app's execution.

## App Hang Detection

### AppHangsV2

Enable <PlatformLink to="/configuration/app-hangs/#app-hangs-v2">AppHangsV2</PlatformLink> to get more detailed app hangs. This differentiates between fully-blocking and non-fully-blocking app hangs, and also tells you the duration of app hangs.

AppHangsV2 is only available on iOS, tvOS, and visionOS.

## Swift Concurrency

### Swift Async Stack Traces

If you use Swift concurrency, stitch together stack traces of your async code with the <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#swiftAsyncStacktraces">`swiftAsyncStacktraces`</PlatformLink> option.

<Alert level="info">

You can enable this in your Objective-C project, but only async code written in Swift will be stitched together.

</Alert>

## Crash & Error Handling

### Persisting Traces When Crashing

Enable the <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#enablePersistingTracesWhenCrashing">`enablePersistingTracesWhenCrashing`</PlatformLink> option to link ongoing transactions to a crash event when your app crashes.

### Unhandled C++ Exceptions V2

Enable the `enableUnhandledCPPExceptionsV2` option to capture fatal C++ exceptions via a more reliable approach that hooks into all instances of the `__cxa_throw` function.

```swift
options.experimental.enableUnhandledCPPExceptionsV2 = true
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
options.experimental.enableUnhandledCPPExceptionsV2 = YES;
```

This provides more comprehensive and consistent exception handling across your app's runtime, regardless of the number of C++ modules or how they're linked, and helps in obtaining accurate stack traces.

**Note:** The mechanism of hooking into `__cxa_throw` could cause issues with symbolication on iOS due to caching of symbol references.

### Session Replay in Unreliable Environments

Enable the `enableSessionReplayInUnreliableEnvironment` option to force enabling of session replay in unreliable environments.

```swift
options.experimental.enableSessionReplayInUnreliableEnvironment = true
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
options.experimental.enableSessionReplayInUnreliableEnvironment = YES;
```

Due to internal changes with the release of Liquid Glass on iOS 26.0, the masking of text and images cannot be reliably guaranteed. Therefore the SDK uses a defensive programming approach to disable the session replay integration by default, unless the environment is detected as reliable.

Indicators for reliable environments include:
- Running on an older version of iOS that doesn't have Liquid Glass (iOS 18 or earlier)
- `UIDesignRequiresCompatibility` is explicitly set to `YES` in Info.plist
- The app was built with Xcode < 26.0 (DTXcode < 2600)

**Important:** This flag allows you to re-enable the session replay integration on iOS 26.0 and later, but please be aware that text and images may not be masked as expected.

Learn more in the <PlatformLink to="/session-replay/">Session Replay</PlatformLink> documentation.

## Providing Feedback

Let us know if you have feedback through [GitHub issues](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/issues). Your feedback helps us improve these experimental features and move them toward stable releases.
