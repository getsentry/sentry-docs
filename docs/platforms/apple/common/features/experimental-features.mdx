Do you want to try some new experimental features? On the latest version of the Apple SDK, you can:

- Enable <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#time-to-full-display">Time to Full Display (TTFD)</PlatformLink> to gain insight into how long it takes your view controller to launch and load all of its content.
<PlatformSection notSupported={["apple.tvos", "apple.watchos", "apple.visionos"]}>
- Enable <PlatformLink to="/profiling/#enable-launch-profiling">App Launch Profiling</PlatformLink> to get detailed profiles for your app launches.
- Enable <PlatformLink to="/profiling/#continuous-profiling">Continuous Profiling</PlatformLink> to get full coverage of your app's execution.
</PlatformSection>
- If you use Swift concurrency, stitch together stack traces of your async code with the `swiftAsyncStacktraces` option. Note that you can enable this in your Objective-C project, but only async code written in Swift will be stitched together.

<Note>
  Experimental features are still a work-in-progress and may have bugs. We
  recognize the irony.
</Note>

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    // ...

    // Enable all experimental features
    options.enableTimeToFullDisplayTracing = true
    options.enableAppLaunchProfiling = true
    options.swiftAsyncStacktraces = true
    options.profilesSampleRate = nil // enable continuous profiling mode
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    // ...

    // Enable all experimental features
    options.enableTimeToFullDisplayTracing = YES;
    options.enableAppLaunchProfiling = YES;
    options.swiftAsyncStacktraces = YES; // only applies to async code in Swift
    options.profilesSampleRate = nil; // enable continuous profiling mode
}];
```
