<Alert>
  Experimental features are still a work-in-progress and may have bugs. We
  recognize the irony.
</Alert>

Experimental features are features that are still being developed and tested. They may have bugs, incomplete functionality, or may change in future releases. Use them at your own risk and provide feedback to help us improve them.

For stable features, see the <PlatformLink to="/common/features">main Features page</PlatformLink>.

## App Hang Detection

<PlatformSection supported={["apple.ios"]}>

### AppHangsV2

Enable <PlatformLink to="/configuration/app-hangs/#app-hangs-v2">AppHangsV2</PlatformLink> to get more detailed app hangs. This differentiates between fully-blocking and non-fully-blocking app hangs, and also tells you the duration of app hangs.

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection notSupported={["apple.ios"]}>

## Swift Concurrency

### Swift Async Stack Traces

If you use Swift concurrency, stitch together stack traces of your async code with the <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#swiftAsyncStacktraces">`swiftAsyncStacktraces`</PlatformLink> option.

<alert type="info">
You can enable this in your Objective-C project, but only async code written in Swift will be stitched together
</alert>

## Crash & Error Handling

### Persisting Traces When Crashing

Enable the <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#enablePersistingTracesWhenCrashing">`enablePersistingTracesWhenCrashing`</PlatformLink> option to link ongoing transactions to a crash event when your app crashes.

### Unhandled C++ Exceptions V2

Enable the <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#enableUnhandledCPPExceptionsV2">`enableUnhandledCPPExceptionsV2`</PlatformLink> option to capture fatal CPPExceptions via hooking into `cxa_throw`.

## Providing Feedback

Let us know if you have feedback through [GitHub issues](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/issues). Your feedback helps us improve these experimental features and move them toward stable releases.
