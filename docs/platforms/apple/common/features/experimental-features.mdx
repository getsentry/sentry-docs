<Alert>
  Experimental features are still a work-in-progress and may have bugs. We
  recognize the irony.
</Alert>

Do you want to try some new experimental features? On the latest version of the Apple SDK, you can:

<PlatformSection notSupported={["apple.tvos", "apple.watchos", "apple.visionos"]}>
- Enable <PlatformLink to="/profiling/#enable-launch-profiling">App Launch Profiling</PlatformLink> to get detailed profiles for your app launches.
- Enable <PlatformLink to="/profiling/#continuous-profiling">Continuous Profiling</PlatformLink> to get full coverage of your app's execution.
</PlatformSection>
<PlatformSection notSupported={["apple.macos", "apple.watchos", "apple.visionos"]}>
- Enable <PlatformLink to="/configuration/app-hangs/#app-hangs-v2">AppHangsV2</PlatformLink> to get more detailed app hangs. This differentiates between fully-blocking and non-fully-blocking app hangs, and also tells you the duration of app hangs.
</PlatformSection>
- If you use Swift concurrency, stitch together stack traces of your async code with the `swiftAsyncStacktraces` option. Note that you can enable this in your Objective-C project, but only async code written in Swift will be stitched together.
- Enable the <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#enable-persisting-traces-when-crashing">`enablePersistingTracesWhenCrashing`</PlatformLink> option to link ongoing transactions to a crash event when your app crashes.
- Enable the `enableUnhandledCPPExceptionsV2` option to capture fatal CPPExceptions via hooking into cxa_throw

Let us know if you have feedback through [GitHub issues](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/issues).
