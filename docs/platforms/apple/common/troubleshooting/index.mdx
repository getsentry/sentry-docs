## "Missing API declaration" after App Store review

Starting May 1, 2024, Apple requires all apps submitted to the App Store to provide a list of privacy-related APIs they use, including the reasons under which they use it. If you received an email from Apple with the message "ITMS-91053: Missing API declaration", your app doesn't fulfill the requirements. To solve this, follow our [Apple Privacy Manifest](/platforms/apple/data-management/apple-privacy-manifest) guide.

## Wrong App Start Data

Starting with iOS 15, the system might [pre-warm](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/app_and_environment/responding_to_the_launch_of_your_app/about_the_app_launch_sequence#3894431) your app by creating the process before the user opens it. In such cases, we can't reliably measure the app start, so we drop it as of [sentry-cocoa 7.18.0](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/releases/tag/7.18.0). We are working on a fix for this. Follow the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/issues/1897) for more details.

## High Slow and Frozen Frames Rate

We recommend updating to at least [7.18.1](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/releases/tag/7.18.1), or else the SDK might report too high a percentage of slow frames.

## Falsely Reported Out Of Memory Crashes

We recommend updating to at least [7.11.0](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/releases/tag/7.11.0), because before this version the SDK might falsely report out-of-memory crashes when an app hangs, and the user kills it manually.

## Crashes with HTTP Auto Performance Instrumentation

We recommend updating to at least [7.5.3](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/releases/tag/7.5.3), because the HTTP instrumentation can lead to crashes. Alternatively, you can also <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#http-instrumentation">disable the feature</PlatformLink>.

## Duplicated Crashes Event With Screenshots

Since the introduction of screenshots for crashes in version [7.20.0](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/releases/tag/7.20.0), projects with 'enableCaptureScreenshot' enabled received duplicated crash reports. Therefore, we recommend updating to at least [7.25.0](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/releases/tag/7.25.0) to fix this problem.

## My first view controller has no performance trace

If your project still initializes a UIWindow during `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` and you plan to use an automatic UIViewController performance tracker, make sure to initialize your window, set the root view controller, and then initialize SentrySDK.

## I use Tuist and the project crashes when I update Sentry

If you use Tuist to manage your SPM dependencies, add the following configuration to your `Dependencies.swift` under `targetSettings`

```Swift
"Sentry": ["USE_HEADERMAP": "YES"]
```

## SentryFileManager: Failed to write data to path

Sentry writes and reads files at a specific path in the app cache directory. This path is created during the SDK initialization.
If you see a log message that looks like this: `[SentryFileManager:439] Failed to write data to path` it means that the cache path doesn't exist anymore.
Check your app for any procedure that cleans the cache of your app during runtime, and avoid deleting the `io.sentry` directory.

## My app is not symbolicated and I use App Store Connect

Since Xcode 14 App Store Connect doesn't make debug symbols available for download anymore, see [Xcode Release Notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-14-release-notes#Deprecations). Please use a different way of uploading the debug symbols by following the [documentation](/platforms/apple/dsym/).

## Crash in `SentrySubClassFinder.actOnSubclassesOfViewControllerInImage`

Suppose your app crashes in `SentrySubClassFinder actOnSubclassesOfViewControllerInImage` with a stacktrace similar to the one below:

```
#0	0x0000000000000000 in 0x00000000 ()
#1	0x00000001043eb498 in type metadata accessor for CapturedStructure? ()
#2	0x00000001043eb3ac in type metadata completion function for RoomCaptureTools ()
#3	0x000000018f9c7930 in swift::MetadataCacheEntryBase<(anonymous namespace)::SingletonMetadataCacheEntry, int>::doInitialization(swift::MetadataWaitQueue::Worker&, swift::MetadataRequest) ()
#4	0x000000018f9b8cf8 in swift_getSingletonMetadata ()
#5	0x00000001043eb360 in type metadata accessor for RoomCaptureTools ()
#6	0x00000001043eb314 in ObjC metadata update function for RoomCaptureTools ()
#7	0x000000018017d938 in realizeClassMaybeSwiftMaybeRelock(objc_class*, mutex_tt<false>&, bool) ()
#8	0x0000000180183548 in look_up_class ()
#9	0x00000001807e7cb8 in NSClassFromString ()
#10	0x000000010514b4c0 in __69-[SentrySubClassFinder actOnSubclassesOfViewControllerInImage:block:]
```

Such a crash may be due to a [potential bug in Swift](https://github.com/apple/swift/issues/72657)
that's triggered when trying to get a class definition that references a RoomPlan or
ActivityKit class on an older iOS version that doesn't support RoomPlan or ActivityKit.
For example, running the code below on iOS 15 with the Sentry Cocoa SDK enabled
leads to the mentioned crash:

```swift
import RoomPlan

@available(iOS 17.0, *)
class RoomPlanWrapper {
    private var finalResults: CapturedStructure?
}
```

You can fix this by excluding the above class from swizzling by using `swizzleClassNameExcludes`,
which is availabe with Sentry Cocoa SDK version `8.23.0` and above:

```swift
SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.swizzleClassNameExcludes = ["RoomPlanWrapper"]
}
```
```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
     options.swizzleClassNameExcludes = [NSSet setWithObjects: @"RoomPlanWrapper", nil];
}];
```

If you can't upgrade the Sentry Cocoa SDK to version `8.23.0`, you can also disable swizzling, as shown below.
However, this would also disable some useful features, such as automatic performance monitoring and network breadcrumbs.

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.enableSwizzling = false
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.enableSwizzling = NO;
}];
```

## Xcode Compiler Error: Invalid Version

If you see the error: `error: invalid version number in '-target arm64-apple-ios9999'` or `invalid version number in '-target arm64-apple-ios10.15-macabi'`
when building your app, this is due to a bug on Xcode. To fix this issue, try to update the Cocoa SDK to version 8.26.0 or above or stay version 8.21.0.
You can also try to switch to Sentry-Dynamic when integrating the Cocoa SDK via Swift Package Manager with the following steps:

1. Open your .xcproject in Xcode.
2. Select your target in Xcode under Targets.
3. Navigate to Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content.
4. Click on the + sign to open a dialog for choosing frameworks and libraries to add.
5. Select Sentry-Dynamic and click the Add button.
6. Remove Sentry to ensure only Sentry-Dynamic appears under Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content.
7. Compile your project.

If you compile your project with Xcode 15.4 and none of the above works, [Apple staff on the Apple forum](https://forums.developer.apple.com/forums/thread/751573)
say it is due to a bug in Xcode 15.4. They recommend sticking to Xcode 15.3 until Apple fixes this bug in a future Xcode release.
