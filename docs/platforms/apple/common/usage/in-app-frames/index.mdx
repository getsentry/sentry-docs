The main executable and frameworks inside the application bundle will be marked as `inApp`, while well known and public frameworks such as UIKitCore, CoreFoundation, GraphicsServices, and so forth will be marked as `not inApp`.

To fine-tune this behaviour, define [Stack Trace Rules](/concepts/data-management/event-grouping/stack-trace-rules/#stack-trace-rules) for your project. This will alow you to mark specific frameworks as `inApp` or `not inApp`, depending on whether you consider them part of your business logic, or third party dependencies. For reference, you can read up on the [default stack trace rules](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/blob/20b05fc91a4ad6783bff1875327f4570bcfb5d00/src/sentry/grouping/enhancer/enhancement-configs/newstyle%402023-01-11.txt#L4).

NOTE: commenting out the below for easier reference: once we tackle a more mid-/long term solution discussed in https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/issues/5252 this will become relevant/correct again

If you're not familiar with these terms, you can learn more:

## Dynamic Frameworks

If you use dynamic frameworks such as Sentry, the Sentry SDK will mark them as `not inApp`. If you have a private framework that should be marked as `inApp`, use the SentryOptions [`inAppInclude`](/platforms/apple/configuration/options/#in-app-include) or [`inAppExclude`](/platforms/apple/configuration/options/#in-app-exclude).


```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"

    // The SDK marks all frameworks starting with MyBusinessLogic as inApp
    options.add(inAppInclude: "MyBusinessLogic")

    // The SDK marks all frameworks starting with MyFramework as not inApp
    options.add(inAppExclude: "MyFramework")
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";

    // The SDK marks all frameworks starting with MyBusinessLogic as inApp
    [options addInAppInclude:@"MyBusinessLogic"];

    // The SDK marks all framework starting with MyFramework as not inApp
    [options addInAppExclude:@"MyFramework"];
}];
```

## Static Frameworks

Because static frameworks end up in the main executable, if you're using one, the Sentry SDK won't be able to detect if a frame of the main executable
originates from your application or a private framework and will mark all frames as `inApp`. To work around this, tell Sentry which frames should be marked as `not inApp`, using [Stack Trace Rules](/concepts/data-management/event-grouping/stack-trace-rules/#stack-trace-rules) on the server. */}
