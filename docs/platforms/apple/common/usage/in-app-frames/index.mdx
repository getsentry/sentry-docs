The `sentry-cocoa` SDK always marks public frameworks such as UIKitCore, CoreFoundation, GraphicsServices, and so forth as `not inApp`. If you're using a version of our SDK that's older than 7.0.0, all private frameworks and the main executable inside the application bundle will be marked as `inApp`. If you're using version 7.0.0 and up, the SDK will only set the `inApp` flag for frames originating from the main executable by using the [CFBundleExecutable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/cfbundleexecutable). For private frameworks such as Sentry, dynamic and static frameworks will differ. 

If you're not familiar with these terms, you can learn more:

- [CFBundleExecutable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/cfbundleexecutable)
- [Dynamic Library Programming Topics](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/DynamicLibraries/000-Introduction/Introduction.html)

## Dynamic Frameworks

If you use dynamic frameworks such as Sentry, the Sentry SDK will mark them as `not inApp`. If you have a private framework that should be marked as `inApp`, use the SentryOptions [`inAppInclude`](/platforms/apple/configuration/options/#in-app-include) or [`inAppExclude`](/platforms/apple/configuration/options/#in-app-exclude).

<SignInNote />

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"

    // The SDK marks all frameworks starting with MyBusinessLogic as inApp
    options.add(inAppInclude: "MyBusinessLogic")

    // The SDK marks all frameworks starting with MyFramework as not inApp
    options.add(inAppExclude: "MyFramework")
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";

    // The SDK marks all frameworks starting with MyBusinessLogic as inApp
    [options addInAppInclude:@"MyBusinessLogic"];

    // The SDK marks all framework starting with MyFramework as not inApp
    [options addInAppExclude:@"MyFramework"];
}];
```

## Static Frameworks

Because static frameworks end up in the main executable, if you're using one, the Sentry SDK won't be able to detect if a frame of the main executable
originates from your application or a private framework and will mark all frames as `inApp`. To work around this, tell Sentry which frames should be marked as `not inApp`, using [Stack Trace Rules](/product/data-management-settings/event-grouping/stack-trace-rules/#stack-trace-rules) on the server.
