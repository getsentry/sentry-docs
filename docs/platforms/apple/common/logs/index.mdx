With Sentry Structured Logs, you can send text-based log information from your applications to Sentry. Once in Sentry, these logs can be viewed alongside relevant errors, searched by text-string, or searched using their individual attributes.

## Limitations

### Missing Logs for Crashes

Logs are collected and sent in batches to reduce the number of individual requests performed. For this reason, unsent **logs might get lost in certain crash scenarios**, where the SDK can not send the logs before the app finally terminates. We are currently working on improving this to ensure that all logs are sent, at the latest on the next app restart.
