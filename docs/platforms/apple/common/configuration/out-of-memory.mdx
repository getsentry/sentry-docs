We renamed this integration to <PlatformLink to="/configuration/watchdog-terminations/">watchdog terminations</PlatformLink> in the 8.0.0 release. The out of memory integration and the watchdog terminations integration are the same thing. The only difference is the name.

If you'd like to opt out of this feature, you can do so using options:


```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    options.enableOutOfMemoryTracking = false
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    options.enableOutOfMemoryTracking = NO;
}];
```
