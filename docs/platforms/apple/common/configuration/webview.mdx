To monitor errors and performance in web views of iOS, iPadOS, and macOS applications, you need to set up Sentry SDKs in both the mobile application and the web projects running in the web views.

## Application Monitoring

The Sentry Cocoa SDK doesn't interact with the mobile application's web views. To monitor errors and performance in the native part of the application follow the [Sentry Cocoa SDK setup instructions](/platforms/apple/).

## WebView Monitoring

To monitor errors and performance in web views choose the appropriate Sentry JavaScript SDK depending on the framework used in the web project.

- [Sentry React SDK](/platforms/javascript/guides/react/) (if the web project uses React)
- [Sentry Angular SDK](/platforms/javascript/guides/angular/) (if the web project uses Angular)
- [Other Sentry JavaScript SDKs](/platforms/javascript)

## Notes

If the web project is accessed remotely and not unique to the mobile application (for example the project also works as a standalone web application), we recommend using separate Sentry projects for the mobile application and the web project.
