title: Migration Guide
sidebar_order: 8000
---

To upgrade from version 4.x of the SDK to version 9.x of the SDK, you must first migrate from 4.x to 5.x, then 5.x to 6.x, then 6.x to 7.x, 7.x to 8.x, and finally from 8.x to 9.x.

## Migrating From 8.x to 9.x

Migrating to 9.x from 8.x includes several breaking changes. We provide this guide to help you update your SDK.

### Changes to Minimum OS Versions and Xcode

We bumped the minimum supported OS versions to:
- **iOS**: 15.0 (previously 11.0)
- **macOS**: 10.14 (previously 10.13)
- **tvOS**: 15.0 (previously 11.0)
- **visionOS**: 1.0 (unchanged)
- **watchOS**: 8.0 (previously 4.0)

We now build the precompiled XCFramework with **Xcode 16**. To submit to the App Store, Apple now requires Xcode 16. If you need a precompiled XCFramework built with Xcode 15, continue using Sentry SDK 8.x.x.

Additionally, the Package.swift sets `swift-tools-version` to 6.0.

### Carthage Support Dropped

We dropped official support for Carthage in v9. If you're using Carthage, please migrate to <PlatformLink to="/install/swift-package-manager/">Swift Package Manager (SPM)</PlatformLink> or <PlatformLink to="/install/cocoapods/">CocoaPods</PlatformLink>.

### Features Enabled by Default

We now enabled the following features by default:

- **Performance V2 is enabled by default**: The app start duration now finishes when the first frame is drawn instead of when the OS posts the `UIWindowDidBecomeVisibleNotification`. We removed the `enablePerformanceV2` option.
- **Pre-warmed app start tracking**: The SDK now collects pre-warmed app starts by default via `enablePreWarmedAppStartTracing`.
- <PlatformLink to="/configuration/app-hangs/#app-hangs-v2">App hang tracking V2</PlatformLink>: This is now the default and we removed the option to enable/disable it.

### Disable App Hang Tracking for Extensions

We now automatically disable app hang tracking for: Widgets, Live Activities, Action Extensions, (Siri) Intent Extensions, Share Extensions. These components run in separate processes or sandboxes with different execution characteristics, which can cause false positive app hang reports.

### Structured Logging

We moved structured logging out of experimental and made it part of the stable API. The `enableLogs` option moved from `options.experimental.enableLogs` to `options.enableLogs`. We added log APIs to `Hub` and `Client`, and logs now include a `sentry.replay_id` attribute.

**Migration required:** Update your code from `options.experimental.enableLogs = true` to `options.enableLogs = true`. Logging is not enabled by default; you must explicitly set this option.

#### HTTP Client Errors

HTTP client errors now mark sessions as errored. This provides better visibility into failed network requests in your release health data.

### Profiling Changes

We removed all deprecated profiling APIs in version [9.0.0](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/releases/tag/9.0.0).

<PlatformSection notSupported={["apple.tvos", "apple.watchos", "apple.visionos"]}>

The only supported profiling method is now <PlatformLink to="/profiling/#enable-ui-profiling">UI Profiling</PlatformLink> (also known as continuous V2 profiling), which was introduced in [version 8.49.0](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/releases/tag/8.49.0).

**Removed deprecated profiling options from `SentryOptions`:**
- `profilesSampleRate` - used for transaction-based profiling (deprecated)
- `profilesSampler` - used for transaction-based profiling (deprecated)
- `enableAppLaunchProfiling` - used for launch profiling (deprecated)

**Migration to UI Profiling:**

If you were using any of the deprecated profiling options, you need to migrate to UI Profiling. Configure profiling by assigning a closure to `SentryOptions.configureProfiling`:

```swift
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    options.configureProfiling = {
        $0.sessionSampleRate = 1
        $0.lifecycle = .manual // or .trace for trace-based lifecycle
    }
}
```

For more information, see the <PlatformLink to="/profiling/#enable-ui-profiling">UI Profiling documentation</PlatformLink>.

</PlatformSection>

### Breaking Changes

#### Option Changes

- `enableFileManagerSwizzling` is now a top-level non-experimental option and remains disabled by default.
- `enableDataSwizzling` is now a top-level option and is enabled by default.
- `enableLogs` is now a top-level non-experimental option and remains disabled by default (you must set it to `true` to enable logging).
- We increased the maximum attachment size to 200MB (previously 20MB)
- We removed the following methods and properties:
  - `inAppExclude` (it had no effect)
  - `integrations`
  - `defaultIntegrations()`
  - `enableTracing` (use `tracesSampleRate` or `tracesSampler` instead)
  - `getStoreEndpoint()`
  - `enablePerformanceV2` the behavior of this option is now enabled by default.

#### Behavioral Breaking Changes

- The default trace context status is now `ok` instead of `undefined`.
- The `function` property on `SentryFrame` now defaults to `nil` instead of `"<redacted>"`
- The `value` and `type` properties on `SentryException` are now nullable; when `NSException` has no reason, `type` is set to `nil`
- We changed the type of the `http.response.status_code` attribute for spans to int

#### Renamed APIs

- We renamed `SentryStructuredLogLevel` to `SentryLogLevel`
- We renamed `SentryStructuredLogAttribute` to `SentryLogAttribute`

#### Removed APIs

- We removed the `segment` property from `SentryTraceContext`, `SentryUser`, and `SentryBaggage`
- We removed the initializers from `SentryTraceContext`
- We removed `SentryDsn.getHash()`
- We removed `SentryFrame.instruction`

We removed the following deprecated APIs:

- `SentrySpan.setExtraValue(_:forKey:)`
- User feedback API (use the new <PlatformLink to="/user-feedback/">feedback API</PlatformLink> instead)
- `Scope.useSpan()` (use `Scope.span` instead)
- `SentryDebugMeta.uuid` (use `debugID` instead)
- `SentryDebugMeta.name` (use `codeFile` instead)

We made the following classes and APIs private:

- `SentryEventDecoder` and `SentryEventDecodable`
- `SentryEnvelopeItemHeader`
- `SentryIntegrationProtocol`
- `SentrySession`
- `SentrySDKInfo`
- `SentryDebugImageProvider`

#### Other breaking changes

- We made the following classes `final`: `PreviewRedactOptions`, `SentryProfileOptions`, `SentryRedactViewHelper`, `SentryViewScreenshotOptions`, `SentryReplayOptions`, `SentryUserFeedbackConfiguration`, `SentryUserFeedbackFormConfiguration`, `SentryUserFeedbackThemeConfiguration`, `SentryUserFeedbackWidgetConfiguration`, `SentryFeedback`, and `SentryExperimentalOptions`

For a complete list of changes, see the [Changelog of version 9.0.0](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/releases/tag/9.0.0)

## Migrating From 7.x to 8.x

Migrating to 8.x from 7.x includes a few breaking changes. We provide this guide to help you update your SDK. It's important to note that this version adds a dependency to Swift, and that we renamed the default branch on the [sentry-cocoa repository](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa) from `master` to `main`.

### Changes to Minimum OS Versions and Xcode

The minimum supported OS versions have been bumped to macOS 10.13, iOS 11, tvOS 11, and watchOS 4. We bumped the minimum Xcode version to 13.

### Features Enabled by Default

The following features are now enabled by default:

- <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#user-interaction-tracing"> The user interaction tracing integration </PlatformLink>
- <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#file-io-tracking"> The File I/O tracing integration </PlatformLink>
- <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#core-data-tracing"> Core Data tracing integration </PlatformLink>
- <PlatformLink to="/configuration/http-client-errors/"> Capture failed requests </PlatformLink>
- <PlatformLink to="/configuration/app-hangs/">App Hangs</PlatformLink> (not available
  for watchOS)

### Changes to Grouping

App Hang events might group differently as we now set the event stack trace snapshot property to `true`.

### Rename OOM to Watchdog Termination

The OOM (out of memory integration) actually tracks [watchdog terminations](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/addressing-watchdog-terminations) based on heuristics. We renamed the integration to better reflect what it does.

### Breaking Changes

#### Configuration Changes

This version includes the following configuration changes:

- Rename `SentryOptions.enableAutoPerformanceTracking` to `SentryOptions.enableAutoPerformanceTracing`
- Rename `SentryOptions.enableUIViewControllerTracking` to `SentryOptions.enableUIViewControllerTracing`
- Rename `SentryOptions.enablePreWarmedAppStartTracking` to `SentryOptions.enablePreWarmedAppStartTracing`
- Rename `SentryOptions.enableFileIOTracking` to `SentryOptions.enableFileIOTracing`
- Rename `SentryOptions.enableCoreDataTracking` to `SentryOptions.enableCoreDataTracing`
- Rename `SentryOptions.enableOutOfMemoryTracking` to `SentryOptions.enableWatchdogTerminationTracking`

#### Swift API Improvements

We made some changes to make the API more ergonomic in Swift:

- Rename `SentrySDK.addBreadcrumb(crumb:)` to `SentrySDK.addBreadcrumb(_ crumb:)`
- Rename `SentryScope.add(_ crumb:)` to `SentryScope.addBreadcrumb(_ crumb:)`
- Rename `SentryScope.add(_ attachment:)` to `SentryScope.addAttachment(_ attachment:)`
- Rename `Client` to `SentryClient`

#### Cleanup Public Classes

We cleaned up our public classes by removing a few functions and properties, that shouldn't be public, to make the API cleaner. In case we removed something you need, please [open an issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/issues/new/choose) on GitHub.

- Make `SpanProtocol.data` non nullable
- Mark `[SpanProtocol setExtraValue:forKey:]` as deprecated
- Make `SpanContext` immutable
  - Remove tags from `SpanContext`
  - Remove context property from `SentrySpan`
- Remove `SentryScope.apply(to:)`
- Remove `SentryScope.apply(to:maxBreadcrumb:)`
- Remove `[SentryOptions initWithDict:didFailWithError:]`
- Remove `[SentryOptions sdkInfo]`
- Make `SentrySession` and `SentrySDKInfo` internal
- Remove default attachment content type
- Remove `captureEnvelope` from `SentryHub` and `SentryClient`
- Remove confusing transaction tag

#### SDK Inits

We removed the version of `SentrySDK.startWithOptions` that took a dictionary, and renamed `SentrySDK.startWithOptionsObject` to `SentrySDK.startWithOptions`. The recommended way to initialize Sentry has not changed:


```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    // ...
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    // ...
}];
```

#### SentrySDK.close Is Now Blocking

`SentrySDK.close` now calls flush, which is a blocking call.

## Migrating From 6.x to 7.x

<Alert title="Important">

We recommend updating to at least [7.5.3](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/releases/tag/7.5.3), because the HTTP instrumentation can lead to crashes. Alternatively, you can also <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#network-tracking">disable the feature</PlatformLink>.

</Alert>

Migrating to 7.x from 6.x includes a few breaking changes. We provide this guide to help you to update your SDK.

### Configuration Changes

This version includes the following configuration changes:

- Change the default maximum number of cached envelopes from 100 to 30. You can now configure this number with `SentryOptions.maxCacheItems`.
- When setting a value `SentryOptions.sampleRate` that is not >= 0.0 and &lt;= 1.0 the SDK sets it to the default of 1.0 instead of keeping the set value.

### Breaking Changes

#### Issue Grouping

This version introduces a change to the grouping of issues. The SDK now sets the `inApp`
flag for frames originating from only the main executable using [CFBundleExecutable](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/cfbundleexecutable).
In previous versions, all frames originating from the application bundle were marked as `inApp`. This had the
downside of marking frames of private frameworks inside the bundle as `inApp`. This problem is fixed now.
Applications using static frameworks shouldn't be affected by this change.
For more information read [mark in-app frames](/concepts/data-management/event-grouping/stack-trace-rules/#mark-in-app-frames).

#### Cleanup Public Classes

We cleaned up our public classes by removing a few functions and properties, that shouldn't be public, to make the API cleaner. In case we removed something you need, please [open an issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/issues/new/choose) on GitHub.

- Remove `SentrySDK.currentHub` and `SentrySDK.setCurrentHub`.
- Remove `SentryClient.storeEnvelope`, which is reserved for Hybrid SDKs.
- Make `closeCachedSessionWithTimestamp` private, which is reserved for internal use.
- Remove deprecated `SentryHub.getScope`. Use `SentryHub.scope` instead.
- Replace `SentryException.thread` with `SentryException.threadId` and `SentryException.stacktrace` to align with the [unified API](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/miscellaneous/unified-api/).
- Replace dict `SentryMechanism.meta` with new class `SentryMechanismMeta` and move `SenryNSError` to `SentryMechanismMeta` to align with the [unified API](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/miscellaneous/unified-api/).
- Change `SentryEvent.timestamp` to `nullable`.

### SentryLogLevel

We replaced the `SentryLogLevel` with `SentryLevel`, renamed `logLevel` to `diagnosticLevel`
on `SentryOptions` to align with other Sentry SDKs, and set the default `diagnosticLevel` to
`SentryLevel.debug`. Furthermore, we removed setting the `logLevel` statically on the `SentrySDK`.
Please use the `SentryOptions` to set the `diagnosticLevel` instead.

6.x

```swift
SentrySDK.start { options in
  options.logLevel = SentryLogLevel.verbose
}

// Or

SentrySDK.logLevel = SentryLogLevel.verbose
```

7.x

```swift
SentrySDK.start { options in
  options.diagnosticLevel = SentryLevel.debug
}
```

## Migrating From 5.x to 6.x

Migrating to 6.x from 5.x includes a few breaking changes. We provide this guide to help you to update your SDK.

### Configuration Changes

This version includes the following configuration changes:

- [Auto Session Tracking](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/blob/7876949ca78aebfe7883432e35727993c5c30829/Sources/Sentry/include/SentryOptions.h#L101) is enabled by default. [This feature](/product/releases/health/) is collecting and sending health data about the usage of your
  application.
- [Attach stack traces](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/blob/b5bf9769a158c66a34352556ade243e55f163a27/Sources/Sentry/Public/SentryOptions.h#L109) is enabled per default.
- We bumped the minimum iOS version to 9.0.
- Use a BOOL in SentryOptions instead of NSNumber to store booleans.
- We had previously removed the [enabled](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/blob/5.2.2/Sources/Sentry/include/SentryOptions.h#L63) option from SentryOptions, but we brought it back in version 6.0.7 with slightly changed functionality. Previously setting an empty or incorrect DSN also set `enabled` to `false`. This side effect is removed. Setting the DSN has no impact on `enabled`. If the DSN is nil or empty or `enabled` is set to `false` and the client won't send any data to Sentry.

### Breaking Changes

#### Store Endpoint

This version uses the [envelope endpoint](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/data-model/envelopes/). If you are using self-hosted Sentry, you must use Sentry version `>= v20.6.0` or higher. If you are using sentry.io, there is no impact. For this change, we also now cache events in envelopes on the disk. We decided not to migrate the few cached events from 5.x to 6.x into envelopes. Instead, we remove them from the disk. As a result, you might lose a few cached events when upgrading.

#### SDK Inits

We removed the [deprecated SDK inits](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/blob/5.2.2/Sources/Sentry/include/SentrySDK.h#L35-L47). The recommended way to initialize Sentry is now:


```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

SentrySDK.start { options in
    options.dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___"
    // ...
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

[SentrySDK startWithConfigureOptions:^(SentryOptions *options) {
    options.dsn = @"___PUBLIC_DSN___";
    // ...
}];
```

#### Cleanup Public Headers

We cleaned up our public headers and made most of our classes private. If you can't access one of the classes you need please [open an issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/issues/new/choose) and tell us your use case so we can evaluates whether to either make the class public again or provide another API for you.

#### New type SentryId for eventId

In 5.x, we used a nullable NSString to represent an event ID. The SDK, Hub, and Client returned this nullable NSString for the event ID to capture messages, events, errors, and so forth. In 6.x, we have a new type SentryId, which is not nullable, to represent an event ID. Instead of returning `nil` when an event couldn't be queued for submission we return `SentryId.empty`.

Example in 5.x:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

let eventId = SentrySDK.capture(message: "A message")
if (nil != eventId) {
    // event was queued for submission
} else {
    // event wasn't queued for submission
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

SentryId *eventId = [SentrySDK captureMessage:@"A message"];
if (nil != eventId) {
    // event was queued for submission
} else {
    // event wasn't queued for submission
}
```

Example in 6.x:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

let eventId = SentrySDK.capture(message: "A message")
if (eventId != SentryId.empty) {
    // event was queued for submission
} else {
    // event wasn't queued for submission
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

SentryId *eventId = [SentrySDK captureMessage:@"A message"];
if (eventId != SentryId.empty) {
    // event was queued for submission
} else {
    // event wasn't queued for submission
}
```

#### New type SentryMessage for Event.message

In 6.x, we introduce a new type [SentryMessage](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/data-model/event-payloads/message/) for `event.message`. SentryMessage provides you the ability to pass a format string with parameters to Sentry, which can help group similar messages into the same issue.

Example in 5.x:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

let event = Event()
event.message = "Hello World"
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

SentryEvent *event = [[SentryEvent alloc] init];
event.message = "Hello World";
```

Example in 6.x:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
import Sentry

let event = Event()
event.message = SentryMessage(formatted: "Hello World")
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
@import Sentry;

SentryEvent *event = [[SentryEvent alloc] init];
event.message = [SentryMessage messageWithFormatted:"Hello World"];
```

#### Make Scope nonnull for capture methods

In 5.x, you could pass a nullable scope to capture methods of the SDK, Hub, and Client, such as `SentrySdk.captureMessage()`. In 6.x, we changed the Scope to nonnull and provide overloads for the Hub and the Client.

Please see the [Changelog](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for a complete list of changes.

## Upgrading From 4.x to 5.x

The samples below illustrate how the SDK works:

### Initialization

Example in 4.x:


```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
do {
    Client.shared = try Client(dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___")
    try Client.shared?.startCrashHandler()
} catch let error {
    print("\(error)")
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
NSError *error = nil;
SentryClient *client = [[SentryClient alloc] initWithDsn:@"___PUBLIC_DSN___" didFailWithError:&error];
SentryClient.sharedClient = client;
[SentryClient.sharedClient startCrashHandlerWithError:&error];
if (nil != error) {
    NSLog(@"%@", error);
}
```

Example in 5.x:


```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
SentrySDK.start(options: [
    "dsn": "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    "debug": true
])
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
[SentrySDK startWithOptions:@{
    @"dsn": @"___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    @"debug": @(YES)
}];
```

### Add Breadcrumb

Example in 4.x:`

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
Client.shared?.breadcrumbs.add(Breadcrumb(level: .info, category: "test"))
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
[SentryClient.sharedClient.breadcrumbs addBreadcrumb:[[SentryBreadcrumb alloc] initWithLevel:kSentrySeverityInfo category:@"test"]];
```

Example in 5.x:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
SentrySDK.addBreadcrumb(Breadcrumb(level: .info, category: "test"))
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
[SentrySDK addBreadcrumb:[[SentryBreadcrumb alloc] initWithLevel:kSentrySeverityInfo category:@"test"]];
```

### CaptureMessage with tags/environment/extra

Example in 4.x:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
let event = Event(level: .debug)
event.message = "Test Message"
event.environment = "staging"
event.extra = ["ios": true]
Client.shared?.send(event: event)
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
SentryEvent *event = [[SentryEvent alloc] initWithLevel:kSentrySeverityDebug];
event.message = @"Test Message";
event.environment = @"staging";
event.extra = @{@"ios": @(YES)};
[SentryClient.sharedClient sendEvent:event withCompletionHandler:nil];
```

Example in 5.x:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
SentrySDK.capture(message: "Test Message") { (scope) in
    scope.setEnvironment("staging")
    scope.setExtras(["ios": true])
    let u = Sentry.User(userId: "1")
    u.email = "tony@example.com"
    scope.setUser(u)
}
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
[SentrySDK captureMessage:@"Test Message" withScopeBlock:^(SentryScope * _Nonnull scope) {
    [scope setEnvironment:@"staging"];
    [scope setExtras:@{@"ios": @(YES)}];
    SentryUser *user = [[SentryUser alloc] initWithUserId:@"1"];
    user.email = @"tony@example.com";
    [scope setUser:user];
}];
```

### setUser

Example in 4.x:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
let u = User(userId: "1")
u.email = "tony@example.com"
Client.shared?.user = user
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
SentryUser *user = [[SentryUser alloc] initWithUserId:@"1"];
user.email = @"tony@example.com";
SentryClient.sharedClient.user = user;
```

Example in 5.x:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
let u = Sentry.User(userId: "1")
u.email = "tony@example.com"
SentrySDK.setUser(u)
```

```objc {tabTitle:Objective-C}
SentryUser *user = [[SentryUser alloc] initWithUserId:@"1"];
user.email = @"tony@example.com";
[SentrySDK setUser:user];
```
