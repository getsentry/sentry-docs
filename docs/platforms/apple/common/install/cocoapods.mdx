To integrate Sentry into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your _Podfile_:

```ruby
platform :ios, '11.0'
use_frameworks! # This is important

target 'YourApp' do
  pod 'Sentry', :git => 'https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa.git', :tag => '{{@inject packages.version('sentry.cocoa') }}'
end
```

Afterwards run `pod install`.

In case you are using Xcode 14 or later, you might have to disable the "Enable User Script Sandbox" option in the target settings by setting it to `NO`. See <PlatformLink to="/troubleshooting#sandbox-error-using-cocoapods">Troubleshooting</PlatformLink> for more information.
