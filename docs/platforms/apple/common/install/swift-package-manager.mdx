To integrate Sentry into your Xcode project using Swift Package Manager (SPM), open your App in Xcode and open **File > Add Packages**. Then add the SDK by entering the git repo url in the top right search field:

```
https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa.git
```

You can define your dependency rule by selecting the SDK version (or branch), and then click the "Add Package" button.
You will then be prompted to choose one of the options `Sentry`, `Sentry-Dynamic` or `SentrySwiftUI`.

- `Sentry` is the static framework, which is the recommended option if you prefer a fast app start time.
- `Sentry-Dynamic` is the dynamic framework.
- `SentrySwiftUI` is used to track performance of SwiftUI views, see more information in the [docs](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/apple/guides/ios/performance/instrumentation/swiftui-instrumentation/).

<Note>
  Xcode allows you to choose many options, but you should choose only one of the
  options above.
</Note>

Alternatively, when your project uses a `Package.swift` file to manage dependencies, you can specify the target with:

```swift {tabTitle:Swift}
.package(url: "https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa", from: "{{@inject packages.version('sentry.cocoa') }}"),
```

<Note>

Version tags or branches need to have the Package.swift file in it or Xcode won't be able to install the package. This means versions previous to `4.4.3` _cannot_ be installed using SPM.

 </Note>
