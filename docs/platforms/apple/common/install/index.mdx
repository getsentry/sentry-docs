We recommend installing the SDK through our [Sentry Wizard](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-wizard) by running the following command inside your project directory:

```bash
brew install getsentry/tools/sentry-wizard && sentry-wizard -i ios
```

This will patch your project and configure the SDK. You'll only need to patch the project once, then you'll be able to add the patched files to your version control system.
If you prefer, you can choose one of the alternative methods below.
