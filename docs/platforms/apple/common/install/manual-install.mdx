---

To integrate Sentry into your Xcode project, follow these steps:

1. Download the latest version of the SDK from the Sentry Cocoa [Releases page](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/releases).
2. Each release contains the following four framework options:
    - Sentry-Dynamic.xcframework.zip: Dynamic framework
	- Sentry.xcframework.zip: Static framework
	- SentrySwiftUI.xcframework.zip: Static Framework with SwiftUI support
	- Sentry-WithoutUIKitOrAppKit.xcframework.zip: Static framework without UIKit or AppKit linking and related features
3. Import the chosen framework into your Xcode project target.

### Usage Guidelines:

	•	Use `Sentry-Dynamic`, `Sentry`, or `Sentry-WithoutUIKitOrAppKit` independently. Only one of these should be included in your project at a time.
	•	If you're using `SentrySwiftUI`, it must be combined with `Sentry-Dynamic`.
