To integrate Sentry into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your _Cartfile_:

```ruby
github "getsentry/sentry-cocoa" "{{@inject packages.version('sentry.cocoa') }}"
```

Run `carthage update --use-xcframeworks` to download the framework and drag the built _Sentry.xcframework_ into your Xcode project.

Sentry's Carthage setup generates 3 different frameworks:

- Sentry
- SentryPrivate
- SentrySwiftUI

_Sentry_ is required for all projects. _SentrySwiftUI_ is required to measure the performance of your SwiftUI views. _SentryPrivate_ is only needed if you changed the carthage build process to generate static frameworks.

The SDK supports integrating Sentry with VisionOS via Carthage on `sentry-cocoa 8.20.0` and above.

## Macs with Apple Silicon and XCFrameworks

If you're using Sentry via Carthage on Macs with Apple Silicon or want to use XCFrameworks, please use Carthage >= 0.38.0, which introduced [support for XCFramework downloaded from Github Releases](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/releases/tag/0.38.0). 

## Deprecating support from building from source 

Starting with `sentry-cocoa 9.0.0`, only XCFramework distribution is officially supported. Run `carthage update --use-xcframeworks` to use the pre-built XCFrameworks that Sentry provides with each release.

While using `carthage build --use-xcframeworks --no-use-binaries` to rebuild from source might work, this approach is *not* officially supported and may cause issues. For officially supported integration, always use the pre-built XCFrameworks.
