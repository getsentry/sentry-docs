## Prerequisites

* You need a [Sentry account](https://sentry.io/signup/) and project
* Your application needs to run on PHP 7.2 or later
* Read one of these other guides if you use <PlatformLink to="/guides/laravel">Laravel</PlatformLink> or <PlatformLink to="/guides/symfony">Symfony</PlatformLink>

## Features

<p className="mb-5">Select which Sentry features you'd like to install in addition to Error Monitoring to get the corresponding installation and configuration instructions below.</p>

<OnboardingOptionButtons
  options={[
    'error-monitoring',
    'performance',
    'profiling',
  ]}
/>

## Install

Install the Sentry SDK using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```bash
composer require sentry/sentry
```

<OnboardingOption optionId="profiling">

To use Profiling, you'll also need to install the Excimer extension via PECL:

```bash
pecl install excimer
```

The Excimer PHP extension supports PHP 7.2 and up. Excimer requires Linux or macOS and doesn't support Windows. For additional ways to install Excimer, [see docs](/platforms/php/profiling/#installation).

</OnboardingOption>

## Configure

To capture all errors, even the one during the startup of your application, you should initialize the Sentry PHP SDK as soon as possible.


```php {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "3-4", "profiling": "5-6"}}
\Sentry\init([
  'dsn' => '___PUBLIC_DSN___' ,
  // Specify a fixed sample rate
  'traces_sample_rate' => 1.0,
  // Set a sampling rate for profiling - this is relative to traces_sample_rate
  'profiles_sample_rate' => 1.0,
]);
```

<Alert level="warning">
  In order to receive stack trace arguments in your errors, make sure to set `zend.exception_ignore_args: Off` in your php.ini
</Alert>

## Verify

In PHP you can either capture a caught exception or capture the last error with captureLastError.

```php
try {
  $this->functionFailsForSure();
} catch (\Throwable $exception) {
  \Sentry\captureException($exception);
}
```

## Set up Sentry through Forge

If you're using Laravel's Forge platform to provision and deploy your PHP application, you can create a Sentry organization through [Forge](https://forge.laravel.com/docs/integrations/sentry.html).
