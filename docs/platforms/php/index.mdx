On this page, we get you up and running with Sentry's PHP SDK, automatically reporting errors and exceptions in your application.

<Note>

If you don't already have an account and Sentry project established, head over to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/signup/), then return to this page.

</Note>

Using a framework? Check out the other SDKs we support in the left-hand dropdown.

<GuideGrid platform="php" />

This Sentry PHP SDK provides support for PHP 7.2 or later. If you are using our previous PHP SDK, you can access the <Link rel={`nofollow`} to={`/platforms/php/legacy-sdk/`}>legacy SDK documentation</Link>, until further notice.

## Install

<OnboardingOptionButtons
  options={[
    'error-monitoring',
    'performance',
    'profiling',
  ]}
/>

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your applicationâ€™s runtime. These are platform-specific and allow Sentry to have a deep understanding of how your application works.

Install the SDK using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

```bash
composer require sentry/sentry
```

<OnboardingOption optionId="profiling">

Install the Excimer extension via PECL:

```bash
pecl install excimer
```

The Excimer PHP extension supports PHP 7.2 and up. Excimer requires Linux or macOS and doesn't support Windows. For additional ways to install Excimer, [see docs](/platforms/php/profiling/#installation).

</OnboardingOption>

## Configure

To capture all errors, even the one during the startup of your application, you should initialize the Sentry PHP SDK as soon as possible.

<SignInNote />

```php {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "3-4", "profiling": "5-6"}}
\Sentry\init([
  'dsn' => '___PUBLIC_DSN___' ,
  // Specify a fixed sample rate
  'traces_sample_rate' => 1.0,
  // Set a sampling rate for profiling - this is relative to traces_sample_rate
  'profiles_sample_rate' => 1.0,
]);
```

## Verify

In PHP you can either capture a caught exception or capture the last error with captureLastError.

```php
try {
  $this->functionFailsForSure();
} catch (\Throwable $exception) {
  \Sentry\captureException($exception);
}
```

## Set up Sentry through Forge

If you're using Laravel's Forge platform to provision and deploy your PHP application, you can create a Sentry organization through [Forge](https://forge.laravel.com/docs/integrations/sentry.html).
