If you don't see any profiling data in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io), you can try the following:

- Ensure that <PlatformLink to="/performance/">Tracing is enabled</PlatformLink>.
- Ensure that the automatic instrumentation is sending performance data to Sentry by going to the **Performance** page in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).
- If the automatic instrumentation is not sending performance data, try using <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation">custom instrumentation</PlatformLink>.
- Ensure the <PlatformLink to="/integrations/#environmentintegration">`Sentry\Integration\EnvironmentIntegration`</PlatformLink> is enabled.
