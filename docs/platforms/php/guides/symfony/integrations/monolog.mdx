When using [Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog) you can configure a [breadcrumb](../../enriching-events/breadcrumbs/) handler to capture Monolog messages as breadcrumbs and a handler that captures messages as events in Sentry.
The breadcrumb handler will not send anything to Sentry directly, it only records breadcrumbs that will be attached to any event or exception sent to Sentry.

```yaml {filename:config/packages/sentry.yaml}
sentry:
    register_error_listener: false # Disables the ErrorListener to avoid duplicated log in sentry
    register_error_handler: false # Disables the ErrorListener, ExceptionListener and FatalErrorListener integrations of the base PHP SDK

services:
    # (Optionally) Configure the breadcrumb handler as a service (needed for the breadcrumb Monolog handler)
    Sentry\Monolog\BreadcrumbHandler:
        arguments:
            - '@Sentry\State\HubInterface'
            - !php/const Monolog\Logger::INFO # Configures the level of messages to capture as breadcrumbs

monolog:
    handlers:
        # (Optionally) Register the breadcrumb handler as a Monolog handler
        sentry_breadcrumbs:
            type: service
            name: sentry_breadcrumbs
            id: Sentry\Monolog\BreadcrumbHandler
        # Register the handler as a Monolog handler to capture messages as events
        sentry:
            type: sentry
            level: !php/const Monolog\Logger::ERROR # Configures the level of messages to capture as events
            hub_id: Sentry\State\HubInterface
            fill_extra_context: true # Enables sending monolog context to Sentry
            process_psr_3_messages: false # Disables the resolution of PSR-3 placeholders in reported messages
```
