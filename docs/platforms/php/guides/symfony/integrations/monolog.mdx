Monolog logs can also be captured as <PlatformLink to="/logs/">Sentry Logs</PlatformLink> for better searchability and querying.

To enable this, set `enable_logs` to `true` in your Sentry configuration:

```yaml {filename:config/packages/sentry.yaml}
sentry:
    options:
        enable_logs: true
```

Then configure the Monolog handler for logs:

```yaml {filename:config/packages/monolog.yaml}
services:
  Sentry\SentryBundle\Monolog\LogsHandler:
    arguments:
      - !php/const Monolog\Logger::WARNING

monolog:
    handlers:
        sentry_logs:
            type: service
            id: Sentry\SentryBundle\Monolog\LogsHandler
```

You can control which log levels are sent to Sentry Logs by configuring the handler's minimum level in your services configuration.

## Breadcrumbs

When using [Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog) you can configure a [breadcrumb](../../enriching-events/breadcrumbs/) handler to capture Monolog messages as breadcrumbs and a handler that captures messages as events in Sentry.
The breadcrumb handler will not send anything to Sentry directly, it only records breadcrumbs that will be attached to any event or exception sent to Sentry.

```yaml {filename:config/packages/sentry.yaml}
sentry:
    register_error_listener: false # Disables the ErrorListener to avoid duplicated log in sentry
    register_error_handler: false # Disables the ErrorListener, ExceptionListener and FatalErrorListener integrations of the base PHP SDK

services:
    # (Optionally) Configure the breadcrumb handler as a service (needed for the breadcrumb Monolog handler)
    Sentry\Monolog\BreadcrumbHandler:
        arguments:
            - '@Sentry\State\HubInterface'
            - !php/const Monolog\Logger::INFO # Configures the level of messages to capture as breadcrumbs

    Sentry\Monolog\Handler:
        arguments:
            - '@Sentry\State\HubInterface'
            - !php/const Monolog\Logger::ERROR

monolog:
    handlers:
        # (Optionally) Register the breadcrumb handler as a Monolog handler
        sentry_breadcrumbs:
            type: service
            name: sentry_breadcrumbs
            id: Sentry\Monolog\BreadcrumbHandler
        # Register the handler as a Monolog handler to capture messages as events
        sentry:
            type: service
            id: Sentry\Monolog\Handler
```
