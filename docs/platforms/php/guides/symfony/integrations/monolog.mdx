When using [Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog) you can configure a [breadcrumb](../../enriching-events/breadcrumbs/) handler to capture Monolog messages as breadcrumbs and a handler that captures messages as events in Sentry.
The breadcrumb handler will not send anything to Sentry directly, it only records breadcrumbs that will be attached to any event or exception sent to Sentry.

```yaml
services:
    # Configure the breadcrumb handler as a service
    Sentry\Monolog\BreadcrumbHandler:
        arguments:
            - '@Sentry\State\HubInterface'
            - !php/const Monolog\Logger::INFO # Configures the level of messages to capture as breadcrumbs

monolog:
    handlers:
        # Register the breadcrumb handler as a Monolog handler
        sentry_breadcrumbs:
            type: service
            name: sentry_breadcrumbs
            id: Sentry\Monolog\BreadcrumbHandler
        # Register the handler as a Monolog handler to capture messages as events
        sentry:
            type: sentry
            level: !php/const Monolog\Logger::ERROR # Configures the level of messages to capture as events
            hub_id: Sentry\State\HubInterface
```
