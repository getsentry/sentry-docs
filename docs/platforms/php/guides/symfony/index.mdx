## Prerequisites

* You need a [Sentry account](https://sentry.io/signup/) and project
* Your Symfony application needs to run on PHP 7.2 or later

## Install

Install the `sentry/sentry-symfony` bundle:

```bash
composer require sentry/sentry-symfony
```

If you are using [Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog) to report events instead of the typical error listener approach, you need this [additional configuration](integrations/monolog/) to log the errors correctly.

## Configure

Add your DSN to your `.env` file:

```plain {filename:.env}
###> sentry/sentry-symfony ###
SENTRY_DSN="___PUBLIC_DSN___"
###< sentry/sentry-symfony ###
```

<Alert level="warning">
  In order to receive stack trace arguments in your errors, make sure to set `zend.exception_ignore_args: Off` in your php.ini
</Alert>

## Verify

To test that both logger error and exception are correctly sent to sentry.io, you can create the following controller:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Controller;

use Psr\Log\LoggerInterface;
use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\AbstractController;
use Symfony\Component\Routing\Annotation\Route;

class SentryTestController extends AbstractController
{
    /**
     * @var LoggerInterface
     */
    private $logger;

    public function __construct(LoggerInterface $logger)
    {
        $this->logger = $logger;
    }

    /**
     * @Route(name="sentry_test", path="/_sentry-test")
     */
    public function testLog()
    {
        // the following code will test if monolog integration logs to sentry
        $this->logger->error('My custom logged error.', ['some' => 'Context Data']);

        // the following code will test if an uncaught exception logs to sentry
        throw new \RuntimeException('Example exception.');
    }
}
```

After you visit the `/_sentry-test` page, you can view and resolve the recorded error by logging into [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and opening your project. Clicking on the error's title will open a page where you can see detailed information and mark it as resolved.
