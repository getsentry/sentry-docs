With Sentry Structured Logs, you can send text based log information from your Laravel applications to Sentry. Once in Sentry, these logs can be viewed alongside relevant errors, searched by text-string, or searched using their individual attributes.

## Requirements

Logs for Laravel are supported in Sentry Laravel SDK version `4.12.0` and above.

## Setup

To configure Sentry as a log channel, add the following config to the `channels` section in `config/logging.php`. If this file does not exist, run `php artisan config:publish logging` to publish it.

```php {filename:config/logging.php}
'channels' => [
    // ...
    'sentry' => [
        'driver' => 'sentry',
    ],
],
```

After you configured the Sentry log channel, you can configure your app to both log to a log file and to Sentry by modifying the log stack:

```php {filename:config/logging.php}
'channels' => [
    'stack' => [
        'driver' => 'stack',
        // Add the Sentry log channel to the stack
        'channels' => ['single', 'sentry'],
    ],
    //...
],
```

Optionally, you can set the logging level and if events should bubble on the driver:

```php {filename:config/logging.php}
'channels' => [
    // ...
    'sentry' => [
        'driver' => 'sentry',
        // The minimum logging level at which this handler will be triggered
        // Available levels: debug, info, notice, warning, error, critical, alert, emergency
        'level' => env('LOG_LEVEL', 'error'),
        'bubble' => true, // Whether the messages that are handled can bubble up the stack or not
    ],
],
```

<Alert title="Note">

If you're using log channels to log your exceptions and are also logging exceptions to Sentry in your exception handler, exceptions might show up in Sentry twice.

## Usage

Once you have configured Sentry as a log channel, you can use Laravel's built-in logging functionality to send logs to Sentry:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;

// Log to all channels in the stack (including Sentry)
Log::info('This is an info message');
Log::warning('This is a warning message');
Log::error('This is an error message');

// Log directly to the Sentry channel
Log::channel('sentry')->error('This will only go to Sentry');

// Log with additional context
Log::error('Something went wrong', [
    'user_id' => auth()->id(),
    'action' => 'update_profile',
    'additional_data' => $data,
]);
```

### Naming Your Log Channels

To filter on multiple log channels inside Sentry, you can add the `name` attribute to the log channel. It will show up in Sentry as the `logger` tag, which is filterable.

For example:

```php {filename:config/logging.php}
'channels' => [
    'my_stacked_channel' => [
        'driver' => 'stack',
        'channels' => ['single', 'sentry'],
        'name' => 'my-channel'
    ],
    //...
],
```

As a result, you can log errors to your channel:

```php
\Log::channel('my_stacked_channel')->error('My error');
```

And Sentry's `logger` tag now has the channel's `name`. You can filter on the "my-channel" value.
