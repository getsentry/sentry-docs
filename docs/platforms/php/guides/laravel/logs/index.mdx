With Sentry Structured Logs, you can send text-based log information from your Laravel applications to Sentry. Once in Sentry, these logs can be viewed alongside relevant errors, searched by text-string, or searched using their individual attributes.

## Troubleshooting

If your logs are not appearing in Sentry, check or test the following:

Check your `config/logging.php` and ensure the default log channel and stack channel allow configuration using environment variables:

```php {filename:config/logging.php}
    // ...
    'default' => env('LOG_CHANNEL', 'stack'),
    // ...
    'channels' => [
        'stack' => [
            'driver' => 'stack',
            'channels' => explode(',', (string) env('LOG_STACK', 'single')),
            'ignore_exceptions' => false,
        ],
    // ...
```

Ensure that if you have defined the `LOG_LEVEL` in your `.env` file, it is set to a level that allows the logs you are expecting to be sent to Sentry.

To test your setup regardless of the Laravel configuration, you can send a test log message to Sentry with the following snippet:

```php
\Sentry\logger()->info('A test log message');
\Sentry\logger()->flush();
```

If that does not work, check your DSN configuration using `php artisan sentry:test`.
