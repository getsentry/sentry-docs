If the SDK is configured with <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#send_default_pii">send_default_pii</PlatformLink> set to `true`, we automatically attach the authenticated user to all your events sent to Sentry. 

If you instead want to manually attach the user to your events, we recommend to listen to Laravel's `\Illuminate\Auth\Events\Authenticated` event:

```php {filename:app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php}
/**
* Bootstrap any application services.
*/
public function boot(): void
{
    \Illuminate\Support\Facades\Event::listen(function (\Illuminate\Auth\Events\Authenticated $event) {
        $user = $event->user;

        \Sentry\Laravel\Integration::configureScope(static function (Scope $scope) use ($user): void {
            $scope->setUser([
                'id' => $user->id,
                'name' => $user->name,
                'email' => $user->email,
            ]);
        });
    });
}
```

You can also clear the currently set user:

```php
\Sentry\Laravel\Integration::configureScope(static function (\Sentry\State\Scope $scope): void {
    $scope->removeUser();
});
```

Users consist of a few critical pieces of information that construct a unique identity in Sentry. Each of these is optional, but one **must** be present for the Sentry SDK to capture the user:

<DefinitionList>

### `id`

Your internal identifier for the user.

### `username`

The username. Typically used as a better label than the internal id.

### `email`

An alternative, or addition, to the username. Sentry is aware of email addresses and can display things such as Gravatars and unlock messaging capabilities.

### `ip_address`

The user's IP address. If the user is unauthenticated, Sentry uses the IP address as a unique identifier for the user.
Serverside SDKs that instrument incoming requests will attempt to pull the IP address from the HTTP request data (`request.env.REMOTE_ADDR` field in JSON), if available. That might require <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#send_default_pii">send_default_pii</PlatformLink> set to `true` in the SDK options.

If the field is omitted, the default value is `null`.

To opt out of storing users' IP addresses in your event data, you can go to your project settings, click on "Security & Privacy", and enable "Prevent Storing of IP Addresses" or use Sentry's [server-side data](/security-legal-pii/scrubbing/) scrubbing to remove `$user.ip_address`. Adding such a rule ultimately overrules any other logic.

</DefinitionList>

Additionally, you can provide arbitrary key/value pairs beyond the reserved names, and the Sentry SDK will store those with the user.
