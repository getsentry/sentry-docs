## Log SDK internal events

A good first step to debug SDK issues is using the `logger` option. For your convenience, the SDK ships with two implementations, `DebugFileLogger` and `DebugStdOutLogger`.

```php
\Sentry\init([
    'logger' => new \Sentry\Logger\DebugFileLogger('/path/to/your/logfile.log'),
]);

// or

\Sentry\init([
    'logger' => new \Sentry\Logger\DebugStdOutLogger(),
]);
```

The produced output will look something like this:

```
sentry/sentry: [debug] The "Sentry\Integration\ExceptionListenerIntegration, Sentry\Integration\ErrorListenerIntegration, Sentry\Integration\FatalErrorListenerIntegration, Sentry\Integration\RequestIntegration, Sentry\Integration\TransactionIntegration, Sentry\Integration\FrameContextifierIntegration, Sentry\Integration\EnvironmentIntegration, Sentry\Integration\ModulesIntegration" integration(s) have been installed.

sentry/sentry: [warning] The profile does not contain enough samples, the profile will be discarded.
sentry/sentry: [info] Sent transaction [59390dc9dd934c0290d8cdc7a589da82] to o1.ingest.sentry.io [project:1]. Result: "success" (status: 200).

```

## Missing Variables in Stack Traces

This is caused by the PHP configuration. PHP 7.4 introduced a new .ini setting, `zend.exception_ignore_args`, that will ignore stack trace arguments. Check your .ini file to ensure this setting is set to `Off` or `0`.
