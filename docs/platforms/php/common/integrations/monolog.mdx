When using [Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog) you can configure a [breadcrumb](../../enriching-events/breadcrumbs/) handler to capture Monolog messages as breadcrumbs and a handler that captures messages as events in Sentry.
The breadcrumb handler will not send anything to Sentry directly, it only records breadcrumbs that will be attached to any event or exception sent to Sentry.

```php
<?php

use Monolog\Level;
use Monolog\Logger;
use Monolog\Handler\StreamHandler;

// Setup the Sentry SDK, this can also be done elsewhere in your application
\Sentry\init([
    'dsn' => '___PUBLIC_DSN___'
]);

// Create a Monolog channel with a breadcrumb handler and a Sentry handler
$log = new Logger('sentry');
$log->pushHandler(new \Sentry\Monolog\BreadcrumbHandler(
    hub: \Sentry\SentrySdk::getCurrentHub(),
    level: Level::Info, // Take note of the level here, messages with that level or higher will be attached to future Sentry events as breadcrumbs
));
$log->pushHandler(new \Sentry\Monolog\Handler(
    hub: \Sentry\SentrySdk::getCurrentHub(),
    level: Level::Error, // Take note of the level here, messages with that level or higher will be sent to Sentry
    bubble: true,
    fillExtraContext: false, // Will add a `monolog.context` & `monolog.extra`, key to the event with the Monolog `context` & `extra` values
));

// Log an error:
$log->error('Something bad happened');

// To log an exception you can use the following code:
try {
    throw new RuntimeException('Some exception');
} catch (RuntimeException $exception) {
    $log->error('Some exception happened', ['exception' => $exception]);
}
```
