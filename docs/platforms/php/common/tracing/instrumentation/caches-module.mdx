Sentry offers a [cache-monitoring dashboard](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/insights/caches/) that can be auto-instrumented by our [Laravel SDK](/platforms/php/guides/laravel/).

If you're using something else, you can manually instrument your cache operations and use Sentry to get a look into how your caching solution is performing by following the setup instructions below.

To make it possible for Sentry to give you an overview of your cache performance, you'll need to create two spans - one indicating that something is being put into the cache, and a second one indicating that something is being fetched from the cache.

Make sure that there's a transaction running when you create the spans. See <PlatformLink to="/tracing/">Tracing</PlatformLink> for more information.

For detailed information about which data can be set, see the [Cache Module developer specification](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/performance/modules/caches/).

## Custom Instrumentation

If you're using anything other than our [Laravel SDK](/platforms/php/guides/laravel/), you'll need to manually instrument the [Cache Module](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/performance/caches/) by following the steps below.

### Add Span When Putting Data Into the Cache

If the cache you're using isn't supported by auto instrumentation mentioned above, you can use the custom instrumentation instructions below to emit cache spans:

1. Set the cache value with whatever cache library you happen to be using.
2. Wrap the part of your application that uses the cached value into a span.
3. Set `op` to `cache.put`.
4. Set `cache.item_size` to an integer representing the size of the cached item.

(The steps described above are documented in the snippet.)

```php
$key = 'cache_key';
$value = 'cache_value';

$parentSpan = \Sentry\SentrySdk::getCurrentHub()->getSpan();

if ($parentSpan !== null) {
    $context = \Sentry\Tracing\SpanContext::make()
        ->setDescription($key)
        ->setOp('cache.put');

    $span = $parentSpan->startChild($context);

    \Sentry\SentrySdk::getCurrentHub()->setSpan($span);

    // Perform you cache operation
    Cache::put($key, $value);
    
    $span
        ->setData([
            // Describe the cache server you are accessing
            'network.peer.address' => '127.0.0.1',
            'network.peer.port' => 9000,
            // Add the key you used
            'cache.key' => $key,
            // Optionally, add the size of the value you set
            'cache.item_size' => strlen($value),
        ])
        ->finish();

    \Sentry\SentrySdk::getCurrentHub()->setSpan($parentSpan);
}
```


### Add Span When Retrieving Data From the Cache

If the cache you're using isn't supported by auto instrumentation mentioned above, you can use the custom instrumentation instructions below to emit cache spans:

1. Fetch the cached value from whatever cache library you happen to be using.
2. Wrap the part of your application that uses the cached value into a span.
3. Set `op` to `cache.get`.
4. Set `cache.hit` to a boolean value representing whether the value was successfully fetched from the cache or not.
5. Set `cache.item_size` to an integer representing the size of the cached item.

(The steps described above are documented in the snippet.)

```php
$key = 'cache_key';
$value = null;

$parentSpan = \Sentry\SentrySdk::getCurrentHub()->getSpan();

if ($parentSpan !== null) {
    $context = \Sentry\Tracing\SpanContext::make()
        ->setOp('cache.get');

    $span = $parentSpan->startChild($context);

    \Sentry\SentrySdk::getCurrentHub()->setSpan($span);

    // Perform you cache operation
    $value = Cache::get($key);
    
    $span->setData([
        // Describe the cache server you are accessing
        'network.peer.address' => '127.0.0.1',
        'network.peer.port' => 9000,
        // Add the key you just retrieved from the cache
        'cache.key' => $key
    ]);

    if ($value !== null) {
        $span->setData([
            // If you retrieved a value, the cache was hit
            'cache.hit' => true,
            // Optionally, add the size of the value you retrieved
            'cache.item_size' => strlen($value),
        ]);
    } else {
        $span->setData([
            // If you could not retrieve a value, it was a miss
            'cache.hit' => false,
        ]);
    }

    $span->finish();

    \Sentry\SentrySdk::getCurrentHub()->setSpan($parentSpan);
}
```

You should now have the right spans in place. Head over to the [Cache dashboard](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/performance/caches/) to see how your cache is performing.
