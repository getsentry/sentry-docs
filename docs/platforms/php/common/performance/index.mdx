With [performance monitoring](/product/performance/), Sentry tracks your software performance, measuring metrics like throughput and latency, and displaying the impact of errors across multiple systems. Sentry captures distributed traces consisting of transactions and spans, which measure individual services and individual operations within those services. Learn more about our model in [Distributed Tracing](/product/sentry-basics/tracing/distributed-tracing/).

<Note>

If you’re adopting Performance in a high-throughput environment, we recommend testing prior to deployment to ensure that your service’s performance characteristics maintain expectations.

## Configure

First, enable tracing and configure the sampling rate for transactions. Set the sample rate for your transactions by either:

- Setting a uniform sample rate for all transactions using the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> option in your SDK config to a number between `0` and `1`. (For example, to send 20% of transactions, set <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> to `0.2`.)
- Controlling the sample rate based on the transaction itself and the context in which it's captured, by providing a function to the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> config option.

The two options are meant to be mutually exclusive. If you set both, <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> will take precedence.

## Verify

While you're testing, set <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> to `1.0`, as that ensures that every transaction will be sent to Sentry.

Once testing is complete, you may want to set a lower <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> value, or switch to using <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> to selectively sample and filter your transactions, based on contextual data.

## Improve Response Time

Response time is somewhat impacted when you use the performance capabilities in your PHP application, (depending on the `traces_sample_rate` you've configured).

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/improve-response-time" />

Doing this will make the PHP process send requests to your local Relay, which will then forward them to Sentry, instead of sending requests to Sentry directly.

To begin using Relay, check out our docs for [getting started](/product/relay/getting-started/).
We recommend using Relay in `managed` mode (which is the default).

Follow the instructions in the Relay docs to send a test event through Relay to Sentry.
Don't forget to update your `DSN` to point to your running Relay instance.
After you set up Relay, you should see a dramatic improvement to the impact on your server.
