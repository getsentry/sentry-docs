SDKs are configurable using a variety of options. The options are largely standardized among SDKs, but there are some differences to better accommodate platform peculiarities. Options are set when the SDK is first
initialized.

<PlatformContent includePath="configuration/config-intro" />

## Common Options

The list of common options across SDKs. These work more or less the same in all SDKs, but some subtle differences will exist to better support the platform. Options that can be read from an environment variable (`SENTRY_DSN`, `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT`, `SENTRY_RELEASE`) are read automatically.

<ConfigKey name="dsn">

The _DSN_ tells the SDK where to send the events. If this value is not provided, the SDK will try to read it from the `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable. If that variable also does not exist, the SDK will just not send any events.

In runtimes without a process environment (such as the browser) that fallback does not apply.

Learn more about [DSN utilization](/product/sentry-basics/dsn-explainer/#dsn-utilization).

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="logger">

If enabled, the SDK prints out debug information about if something went wrong while sending events.
It isn't recommended to use this in production.

<PlatformContent includePath="configuration/logger/" />

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="release">

Sets the release. Some SDKs will try to automatically configure a release out of the box but it's a better idea to manually set it to guarantee that the release is in sync with your deploy integrations or source map uploads. Release names are strings, but some formats are detected by Sentry and might be rendered differently. Learn more about how to send release data so Sentry can tell you about regressions between releases and identify the potential source in [the releases documentation](/product/releases/) or the <SandboxLink scenario="releases">sandbox</SandboxLink>.

By default the SDK will try to read this value from the `SENTRY_RELEASE` environment variable (in the browser SDK, this will be read off of the `window.SENTRY_RELEASE.id` if available).

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="environment">

Sets the environment. This string is freeform and set to `production` by default. A release can be associated with more than one environment to separate them in the UI (think `staging` vs `production` or similar).

By default the SDK will try to read this value from the `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="error-types">

Sets which errors are reported. It takes the same values as PHP's [`error_reporting`](https://www.php.net/manual/errorfunc.configuration.php#ini.error-reporting) configuration parameter.

By default all types of errors are be reported (equivalent to `E_ALL`).

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="sample-rate">

Configures the sample rate for error events, in the range of `0.0` to `1.0`. The default is `1.0`, which means that 100% of error events will be sent. If set to `0.1`, only 10% of error events will be sent. Events are picked randomly.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="max-breadcrumbs">

This variable controls the total amount of breadcrumbs that should be captured. This defaults to `100`, but you can set this to any number. However, you should be aware that Sentry has a [maximum payload size](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/data-model/envelopes/#size-limits) and any events exceeding that payload size will be dropped.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="attach-stacktrace">

When enabled, stack traces are automatically attached to all messages logged. Stack traces are always attached to exceptions; however, when this option is set, stack traces are also sent with messages. This option, for instance, means that stack traces appear next to all log messages.

This option is turned off by default.

Grouping in Sentry is different for events with stack traces and without. As a result, you will get new groups as you enable or disable this flag for certain events.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="send-default-pii">

If this flag is enabled, certain personally identifiable information (PII) is added by active integrations. By default, no such data is sent.

<Note>

If you are using Sentry in your mobile app, read our [frequently asked questions about mobile data privacy](/security-legal-pii/security/mobile-privacy/) to assist with Apple App Store and Google Play app privacy details.

</Note>

This option is turned off by default.

If you enable this option, be sure to manually remove what you don't want to send using our features for managing [_Sensitive Data_](../../data-management/sensitive-data/).

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="server-name">

This option can be used to supply a "server name." When provided, the name of the server is sent along and persisted in the event. For many integrations, the server name actually corresponds to the device hostname, even in situations where the machine is not actually a server.

Most SDKs will attempt to auto-discover this value.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="ignore-exceptions">

A list of class names that matches exceptions that shouldn't be sent to Sentry.
Checks whether the provided class name is of a given type or subtype.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="ignore-transactions">

A list of strings that match transaction names that shouldn't be sent to Sentry.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="in-app-include">

A list of string prefixes of module names that belong to the app. This option takes precedence over `in-app-exclude`.

Sentry differentiates stack frames that are directly related to your application ("in application") from stack frames that come from other packages such as the standard library, frameworks, or other dependencies. The application package is automatically marked as `inApp`. The difference is visible in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io), where only the "in application" frames are displayed by default.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="in-app-exclude">

A list of string prefixes of module names that do not belong to the app, but rather to third-party packages. Modules considered not part of the app will be hidden from stack traces by default.

This option can be overridden using <PlatformIdentifier name="in-app-include" />.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="max-request-body-size">

This parameter controls whether integrations should capture HTTP request bodies. It can be set to one of the following values:

- `never`: Request bodies are never sent.
- `small`: Only small request bodies will be captured. The cutoff for small depends on the SDK (typically 4KB).
- `medium`: Medium and small requests will be captured (typically 10KB).
- `always`: The SDK will always capture the request body as long as Sentry can make sense of it.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="max-value-length">

The number of characters after which the values containing text in the event payload will be truncated (defaults to `1024`).

<Note>
  If the value you set for this is exceptionally large, the event may exceed 1
  MiB and will be dropped by Sentry.
</Note>

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="context-lines">

The number of context lines for each frame in the stack trace when loading a file.

</ConfigKey>

## Hooks

These options can be used to hook the SDK in various ways to customize the reporting of events.

<ConfigKey name="before-send">

This function is called with an SDK-specific message or error event object, and can return a modified event object, or `null` to skip reporting the event. This can be used, for instance, for manual PII stripping before sending.

By the time <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send" /> is executed, all scope data has already been applied to the event. Further modification of the scope won't have any effect.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="before-send-transaction">

This function is called with an SDK-specific transaction event object, and can return a modified transaction event object, or `null` to skip reporting the event. One way this might be used is for manual PII stripping before sending.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="before-send-check-in">

This function is called with an SDK-specific check-in event object, and can return a modified check-in event object, or `null` to skip reporting the event.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="before-breadcrumb">

This function is called with an SDK-specific breadcrumb object before the breadcrumb is added to the scope. When nothing is returned from the function, the breadcrumb is dropped. To pass the breadcrumb through, return the first argument, which contains the breadcrumb object.
The callback typically gets a second argument (called a "hint") which contains the original object from which the breadcrumb was created to further customize what the breadcrumb should look like.

</ConfigKey>

## Transport Options

Transports are used to send events to Sentry. Transports can be customized to some degree to better support highly specific deployments.

<ConfigKey name="transport">

Switches out the transport used to send events. How this works depends on the SDK. It can, for instance, be used to capture events for unit-testing or to send it through some more complex setup that requires proxy authentication.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="http-proxy">

When set, a proxy can be configured that should be used for outbound requests. This is also used for HTTPS requests unless a separate `https-proxy` is configured. However, not all SDKs support a separate HTTPS proxy. SDKs will attempt to default to the system-wide configured proxy, if possible. For instance, on Unix systems, the `http_proxy` environment variable will be picked up.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="send-attempts">

_Deprecated._ Controls how many times the SDK will attempt to resend an event to Sentry. The default is `0`.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="http-connect-timeout">

The maximum number of seconds to wait while trying to connect to a server. The default is `2`.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="http-timeout">

The maximum execution time, in seconds, for the request+response as a whole. The value should also include the time for the connect phase, so it should be greater than the value set for the `http_connect_timeout` option. The default is `5`.

</ConfigKey>

## Tracing Options

<ConfigKey name="enable-tracing">

A boolean value, if true, transactions and trace data will be generated and captured. This will set the `traces-sample-rate` to the recommended default of 1.0 if `traces-sample-rate` is not defined. Note that `traces-sample-rate` and `traces-sampler` take precedence over this option.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="traces-sample-rate">

A number between 0 and 1, controlling the percentage chance a given transaction will be sent to Sentry. (0 represents 0% while 1 represents 100%.) Applies equally to all transactions created in the app. Either this or <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> must be defined to enable tracing.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="traces-sampler">

A function responsible for determining the percentage chance a given transaction will be sent to Sentry. It will automatically be passed information about the transaction and the context in which it's being created, and must return a number between `0` (0% chance of being sent) and `1` (100% chance of being sent). Can also be used for filtering transactions, by returning 0 for those that are unwanted. Either this or <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> must be defined to enable tracing.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="trace-propagation-targets">

An optional property that controls which downstream services receive tracing data, in the form of a `sentry-trace` and a `baggage` header attached to any outgoing HTTP requests.

The option may contain a list of strings against which the hosts of outgoing requests are matched.
If one of the entries in the list matches the host of an outgoing request, trace data will be attached to that request.

If <PlatformIdentifier name="trace-propagation-targets" /> is not provided, trace data is attached to every outgoing request from the [instrumented client](../../tracing/instrumentation/requests-module/).
To disable sending trace data to any downstream service, set this option to an empty array (`[]`).

</ConfigKey>
