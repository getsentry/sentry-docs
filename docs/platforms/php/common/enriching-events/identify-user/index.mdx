To attach the user to your events, we recommend to listen to Laravel's `\Illuminate\Auth\Events\Authenticated` event:

<PlatformContent includePath="enriching-events/set-user" />

You can also clear the currently set user:

<PlatformContent includePath="enriching-events/unset-user" />

Users consist of a few critical pieces of information that construct a unique identity in Sentry. Each of these is optional, but one **must** be present for the Sentry SDK to capture the user:

<DefinitionList>

### `id`

Your internal identifier for the user.

### `username`

The username. Typically used as a better label than the internal id.

### `email`

An alternative, or addition, to the username. Sentry is aware of email addresses and can display things such as Gravatars and unlock messaging capabilities.

### `ip_address`

The user's IP address. If the user is unauthenticated, Sentry uses the IP address as a unique identifier for the user.
Serverside SDKs that instrument incoming requests will attempt to pull the IP address from the HTTP request data (`request.env.REMOTE_ADDR` field in JSON), if available. That might require <PlatformIdentifier name="send-default-pii" /> set to `true` in the SDK options.

If the field is omitted, the default value is `null`.

To opt out of storing users' IP addresses in your event data, you can go to your project settings, click on "Security & Privacy", and enable "Prevent Storing of IP Addresses" or use Sentry's [server-side data](/security-legal-pii/scrubbing/) scrubbing to remove `$user.ip_address`. Adding such a rule ultimately overrules any other logic.

</DefinitionList>

Additionally, you can provide arbitrary key/value pairs beyond the reserved names, and the Sentry SDK will store those with the user.
