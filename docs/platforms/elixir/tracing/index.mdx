With [tracing](/product/insights/overview/), Sentry tracks your software performance, measuring metrics like throughput and latency, and displaying the impact of errors across multiple systems.

<Alert>

Tracing in Elixir SDK is available starting from 11.0.0 and it's currently in Beta.

## Install Dependencies

Sentry's Elixir SDK uses OpenTelemetry for tracing. Add the required dependencies to your `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    # Sentry SDK
    {:sentry, "~> 11.0"},

    # OpenTelemetry core packages
    {:opentelemetry, "~> 1.5"},
    {:opentelemetry_api, "~> 1.4"},
    {:opentelemetry_exporter, "~> 1.0"},
    {:opentelemetry_semantic_conventions, "~> 1.27"},

    # Instrumentation libraries (choose what you need)
    {:opentelemetry_phoenix, "~> 2.0"},      # for Phoenix
    {:opentelemetry_bandit, "~> 0.1"},       # for Bandit (Phoenix 1.7+)
    {:opentelemetry_ecto, "~> 1.2"},         # for Ecto

    # ... your other dependencies
  ]
end
```

## Configure Sentry

Enable tracing in your Sentry configuration:

```elixir
# config/config.exs or config/dev.exs
config :sentry,
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  traces_sample_rate: 1.0  # Adjust for production
```

## Configure OpenTelemetry

Set up OpenTelemetry to send traces to Sentry:

```elixir
# config/config.exs
config :opentelemetry, span_processor: {Sentry.OpenTelemetry.SpanProcessor, []}

config :opentelemetry, sampler: {Sentry.OpenTelemetry.Sampler, []}
```

## Set Up Phoenix Instrumentation

In your `application.ex`, set up the OpenTelemetry instrumentation:

```elixir
# lib/my_app/application.ex
defmodule MyApp.Application do
  use Application

  def start(_type, _args) do
    # Set up OpenTelemetry instrumentation
    OpentelemetryBandit.setup()           # for Bandit (Phoenix 1.7+)
    # OR OpentelemetryPhoenix.setup(adapter: :cowboy2)  # for Cowboy

    OpentelemetryPhoenix.setup(adapter: :bandit)
    OpentelemetryEcto.setup([:my_app, :repo], db_statement: :enabled)

    # Optional: Set up Oban instrumentation
    # OpentelemetryOban.setup()

    children = [
      # ... your supervision tree
    ]

    opts = [strategy: :one_for_one, name: MyApp.Supervisor]
    Supervisor.start_link(children, opts)
  end
end
```

## Advanced Sampling

For more control over sampling, you can use a sampling function:

```elixir
config :sentry,
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  traces_sampler: fn sampling_context ->
    case sampling_context.transaction_context.op do
      "http.server" -> 0.1  # Sample 10% of HTTP requests
      _ -> 0.05             # Sample 5% of other operations
    end
  end
```
