The [Quantum](https://github.com/quantum-elixir/quantum-core) integration supports cron monitoring for Quantum jobs.

This integration is built into the Sentry SDK.

## Configure

You can configure the Oban integration in your Sentry configuration, under the `:integrations` key:

```elixir {filename:config/config.exs)

config :sentry,
  # ...,
  integrations: [
    quantum: [
      cron: [enabled: true]
    ]
  ]
```
