The [Telemetry](https://github.com/beam-telemetry/telemetry) integration supports:

  * Capturing errors that happen in Telemetry handlers and reporting them.

This integration is built into the Sentry SDK starting with *v10.10.0*.

## Configure

You can configure the Telemetry integration in your Sentry configuration, under the `:integrations` key:

```elixir {filename:config/config.exs} {diff}
config :sentry,
  # ...,
  integrations: [
+    telemetry: [
+      report_handler_failures: true,
+    ]
  ]
```

This configuration will report failed Telemetry handler errors to Sentry. It's usually important to report these errors, as Telemetry *detaches* failing handlers. If you don't monitor these errors, you may not know that a handler failed and is not going to execute anymore until it's re-attached (usually when the application restarts).
