The [Oban](https://getoban.pro) integration supports:

  * Capturing errors and exceptions that happen in Oban jobs.
  * Cron monitoring for scheduled Oban jobs.

This integration is built into the Sentry SDK.

## Configure

You can configure the Oban integration in your Sentry configuration, under the `:integrations` key:

```elixir {filename:config/config.exs}

config :sentry,
  # ...,
  integrations: [
    oban: [
      # Capture errors:
      capture_errors: true,
      # Monitor cron jobs:
      cron: [enabled: true]
    ]
  ]
```
