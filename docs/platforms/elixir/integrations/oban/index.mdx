The [Oban](https://getoban.pro) integration supports:

  * Capturing errors and exceptions that happen in Oban jobs.
  * Cron monitoring for scheduled Oban jobs.

This integration is built into the Sentry SDK since *v10.2.0*, and supports automatic monitoring since *v10.3.0*. It requires:

  1. Oban to be a dependency of your application.
  1. Oban version 2.17.6 or greater.
  1. Elixir 1.13 or later, since that is required by Oban itself.

## Configure

You can configure the Oban integration in your Sentry configuration, under the `:integrations` key:

```elixir {filename:config/config.exs}

config :sentry,
  # ...,
  integrations: [
    oban: [
      # Capture errors:
      capture_errors: true,
      # Monitor cron jobs:
      cron: [enabled: true]
    ]
  ]
```

This configuration will report failed Oban jobs to Sentry. It will also report started, completed, and failed job, alongside their duration. It will use the worker name as the `monitor_slug` of the reported cron.
