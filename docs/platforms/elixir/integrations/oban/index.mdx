The [Oban](https://getoban.pro) integration supports:

  * Capturing errors and exceptions that happen in Oban jobs.
  * Cron monitoring for scheduled Oban jobs.

This integration is built into the Sentry SDK starting with *v10.2.0*. It supports automatic monitoring starting with *v10.3.0*. It requires:

  1. Oban version 2.17.6 and up to be a dependency of your application.
  1. Elixir version 1.13 and up, (since that's required by Oban).

## Configure

You can configure the Oban integration in your Sentry configuration, under the `:integrations` key:

```elixir {filename:config/config.exs}
config :sentry,
  # ...,
  integrations: [
    oban: [
      # Capture errors:
      capture_errors: true,
      # Monitor cron jobs:
      cron: [enabled: true]
    ]
  ]
```

This configuration will report failed Oban jobs to Sentry. It will also report started, completed, and failed jobs, as well as their duration. It will use the worker name as the `monitor_slug` of the reported cron.

<Alert title="Perform Errors">
Oban wraps *unhandled* crashes, exits, and throws in jobs inside [`Oban.CrashError`](https://hexdocs.pm/oban/2.18.0/Oban.CrashError.html) exceptions. However, if jobs return errors manually (such as by returning `{:error, reason}` tuples) then Oban will wrap those inside [`Oban.PerformError`](https://hexdocs.pm/oban/2.18.0/Oban.PerformError.html) exceptions. If you only want to report crashes to Sentry, you can either configure an event filter that doesn't report `Oban.PerformError` events, or that inspects its `:reason` field to determine whether to report them. For example:

```elixir
def before_send(event) do
  case event.original_exception do
    %Oban.PerformError{reason: {:error, reason}} -> event
    %Oban.PerformError{} -> nil
    _other -> event
  end
end
```

The Oban job itself (an [`Oban.Job` struct](https://hexdocs.pm/oban/Oban.Job.html)) is also available inside the event's `:integration_meta` field, under:

```elixir
event.integration_meta[:oban][:job]
```

You can use this for more complex filtering logic based on number of attempts and such.

See <Link to="/platforms/elixir/configuration/filtering">the documentation for event callbacks</Link>.
</Alert>

### Customizing Job Check-In Information

If you want to customize the information that is sent to Sentry when a job checks in, you can do so by providing a function that takes the job and returns a map of metadata.

```elixir {filename:lib/my_app/my_worker.ex}
defmodule MyApp.MyWorker do
  use Oban.Worker
  
  @behaviour Sentry.Integrations.Oban.Cron
  
  @impl Oban.Worker
  def perform(args) do
    # ...
  end
  
  @impl Sentry.Integrations.Oban.Cron
  def sentry_check_in_configuration(job) do
    [monitor_slug: "custom-slug-#{job.id}"]
  end
end
```

This is available since v10.9.0 of the SDK.
