title: Set Up Crons
description: "Sentry Crons allows you to monitor the uptime and performance of any scheduled, recurring job in your application."
sidebar_order: 5750

Once implemented, it'll allow you to get alerts and metrics to help you solve errors, detect timeouts, and prevent disruptions to your service.

## Requirements

<PlatformContent includePath="crons/requirements" />

<PlatformContent includePath="crons/setup" />

## Alerts

When your recurring job fails to check in (missed), runs beyond its configured maximum runtime (failed), or manually reports a failure, Sentry will create an error event with a tag connected to your monitor.

To receive alerts about these events:

1. Navigate to **Alerts** in the sidebar.
2. Create a new alert and select "Issues" under "Errors" as the alert type.
3. Configure your alert and define a filter match to use: `The event's tags match {key} {match} {value}`.

Example: `The event's tags match monitor.slug equals my-monitor-slug-here`
