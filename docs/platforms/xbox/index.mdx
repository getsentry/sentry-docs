## Using with Game Engines

If you're using Unity or Unreal Engine, use the game engine SDK instead of integrating the Xbox SDK directly. The game engine SDKs wrap the Xbox SDK and provide engine-specific features:

- [Unity SDK for Xbox](/platforms/unity/game-consoles/) - captures C# exceptions and syncs context with native crashes
- [Unreal Engine SDK for Xbox](/platforms/unreal/game-consoles/) - provides C++ and Blueprint APIs on top of the Xbox SDK

For custom engines or native C++ games, integrate the Xbox SDK directly as described above.

<Alert>
Access to Sentry's error and crash reporting for consoles is a paid feature. We will review the pricing and details with you during the verification process.
