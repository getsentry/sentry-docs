Sentry supports Xbox via a customized version of the [Native SDK](/platforms/native).

To start using Sentry in your Xbox games, you can [request Microsoft Game Development Kit (GDK) Middleware access](developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/support/request-gdkx-middleware).
Make sure to select Sentry as the partner and use the email address associated with your Sentry account.

We'll receive your request and get back to you with the next steps.
