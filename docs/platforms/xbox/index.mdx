Sentry supports Xbox via a customized version of the [Native SDK](/platforms/native).

To start using Sentry in your Xbox games, you can [request Microsoft Game Development Kit (GDK) Middleware access](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/support/request-gdkx-middleware).

We'll receive your request and get back to you with the next steps.
