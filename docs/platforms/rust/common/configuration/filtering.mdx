When you add Sentry to your app, you get a lot of valuable information about errors and performance. And lots of information is good -- as long as it's the right information, at a reasonable volume.

The Sentry SDKs have several configuration options to help you filter out events.

We also offer [Inbound Filters](/concepts/data-management/filtering/) to filter events in sentry.io. We recommend filtering at the client level though, because it removes the overhead of sending events you don't actually want. Learn more about the [fields available in an event](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/data-model/event-payloads/).

## Filtering Error Events

Configure your SDK to filter error events by using the <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send" /> callback method and configuring, enabling, or disabling integrations.

### Using <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send" />

All Sentry SDKs support the <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send" /> callback method. Because it's called immediately before the event is sent to the server, this is your last chance to decide not to send data or to edit it. <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send" /> receives the event object as a parameter, which you can use to either modify the eventâ€™s data or drop it completely by returning `None`, based on custom logic and the data available on the event.

<PlatformContent includePath="configuration/before-send/" />

Note also that breadcrumbs can be filtered, as discussed in [our Breadcrumbs documentation](/product/error-monitoring/breadcrumbs/).

<PlatformContent includePath="configuration/before-send-fingerprint">

In this example, the fingerprint is forced to a common value if an exception of a certain type has been caught:

</PlatformContent>
