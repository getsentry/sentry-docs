A release is a version of your code that is deployed to an <PlatformLink to="/configuration/environments/">environment</PlatformLink>. When you give Sentry information about your releases, you can:

- Determine issues and regressions introduced in a new release
- Predict which commit caused an issue and who is likely responsible
- Resolve issues by including the issue number in your commit message
- Receive email notifications when your code gets deployed

<Include name="bind-release-version.mdx" />

## Setup

To use the Release Health features, you need to activate the `release-health` feature flag of the `sentry` crate (enabled by default).
Additionally, you need to initialize the SDK by specifying additional options:

```rust
use sentry;

let _guard = sentry::init(("___PUBLIC_DSN___", sentry::ClientOptions {
    // The `sentry::release_name` macro automatically infers the release from the cargo metadata, and is the preferred way to set the release
    release: sentry::release_name!(),
    // OR, manually:
    // release: Some("my-project-name@2.3.12".into()),

    // Enables automatic session tracking, according to the configured `session_mode`.
    // If the value of this option is set `false`, sessions need to be manually managed using `sentry::start_session` and `sentry::stop_session`.
    auto_session_tracking: true,

    // Sets the automatic session tracking mode.
    // Possible values are `sentry::SessionMode::Application` and `sentry::SessionMode::Request`.
    // `Application` should be used for user-attended programs, which typically have a single long running session that span the application's lifetime.
    // `Request` should be used for servers, where each incoming request shall be considered as its own session.
    session_mode: sentry::SessionMode::Application,

    ..Default::default()
}));
```

## Setting a Release

Setting the release name tags each event with that release name. We recommend that you tell Sentry about a new release before sending events with that release name, as this will unlock a few more features. Learn more in our [Releases](/product/releases/) documentation.

If you don't tell Sentry about a new release, Sentry will automatically create a release entity in the system the first time it sees an event with that release ID.

After configuring your SDK, you can install a repository integration or manually supply Sentry with your own commit metadata. Read our documentation about [setting up releases](/product/releases/setup/) for further information about integrations, associating commits, and telling Sentry when deploying releases.

## Release Health

Monitor the [health of releases](/product/releases/health/) by observing user adoption, usage of the application, percentage of [crashes](/product/releases/health/#crashes), and [session data](/product/releases/health/#sessions). Release health will provide insight into the impact of crashes and bugs as it relates to user experience, and reveal trends with each new issue through the [Release Details](/product/releases/release-details/) graphs and filters.

In order to monitor release health, the SDK sends session data.

### Sessions

A session represents the interaction between the user and the application. Sessions contain a timestamp, a status (if the session was OK or if it crashed), and are always linked to a release.
