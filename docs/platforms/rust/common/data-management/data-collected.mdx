Sentry takes data privacy very seriously and has default settings in place that prioritize data safety, especially when it comes to personally identifiable information (PII) data.
When you add the Sentry SDK to your application, you allow it to collect data and send it to Sentry during the runtime of your application.

We are currently working with high priority on improving defaults and providing more control over what data is collected and sent to Sentry by the Sentry Rust SDK to align with our data privacy principles.

In the meantime, here is the information about what data is collected by the Sentry Rust SDK.
The category types and amount of data collected vary, depending on the integrations you've enabled in the Sentry SDK.

## HTTP Headers

By default, the Sentry SDK sends all HTTP headers captured by `sentry-actix` and `sentry-tower` (with `http` feature enabled) to Sentry.
For both integrations, it's possible to exclude certain headers from being sent by registering an additional middleware on your HTTP server and setting `header.set_sensitive(true)` on the headers you want to exclude.

## Cookies

All request cookies are sent to Sentry. Server-side scrubbing rules are in place that will filter out certain well-known cookies that contain sensitive data.

## Information About Logged-in User

By default, the Sentry SDK doesn't send any information about the logged-in user, such as email address, user ID, or username.
User information can be manually captured by calling `scope.set_user` and providing the appropriate user information.

## Users' IP Address

By default, the Sentry SDK doesn't send the user's IP address.
To enable automatic IP address collection for `sentry-actix`, set `send_default_pii` to `true` in your `sentry::init` options.
User IP information can be manually captured by calling `scope.set_user` and providing the user's IP address.

## Request URL

The full request URL of incoming HTTP requests captured by `sentry-actix` and `sentry-tower` (with `http` feature enabled) is **always sent to Sentry**. Depending on your application, this could contain PII data.

## Request Query String

The request query string captured by `sentry-actix` and `sentry-tower` (with `http` feature enabled) is **always sent to Sentry**.
Depending on your application, this could contain PII data.

## Request Body

The request body of incoming HTTP requests is not sent to Sentry by default.
When using `sentry-actix`, the Sentry SDK can capture the request body. A prerequisite for this is to set `send_default_pii` to `true` in your `sentry::init` options.
Then, whether the request body is sent or not, depends on the type and size of request body as described below:

- **The type of the request body:**
  - JSON and form bodies are sent
  - Raw request bodies are always removed
  - Uploaded files in the request bodies are never sent to Sentry
- **The size of the request body:** There's a [`max_request_body_size`](/platforms/rust/configuration/options/#max-request-body-size) option that's set to `MaxRequestBodySize::Medium` by default, which governs the maximum size of request bodies that are sent to Sentry.

If you want to prevent request bodies from being sent to Sentry altogether, set `max_request_body_size` to `MaxRequestBodySize::None`.

## Debug Images

When using the [Sentry Debug Images](https://crates.io/crates/sentry-debug-images) integration, some metadata about the shared libraries and executables currently loaded in memory by the running process is sent to Sentry.
This integration is enabled by default when using the `sentry` crate via the `debug-images` feature flag.
You can opt out of this feature by excluding the `debug-images` feature from your feature flags for `sentry` in your `Cargo.toml`.

## Source Code

When you use [Source Context](/platforms/rust/source-context/), you explicitly upload your source code to Sentry.
This is fully opt-in and not controlled by the Sentry SDK.
