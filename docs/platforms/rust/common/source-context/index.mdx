## Prerequisites

[Install](/cli/installation/) and [Configure](/cli/configuration/) Sentry CLI by providing an auth token, org and project.

Then, enable full debug information for your release build:
```toml {filename:Cargo.toml}
[profiles.release]
debug = true
```

The binary will be stripped of the debug information which will be collected along with the source code and uploaded to Sentry.

## Upload debug information files and source code

Build the release binary, extract debug information and strip it from the binary:
```bash
cargo build --release
objcopy --only-keep-debug target/release/app{,.d}
objcopy --strip-debug --strip-unneeded target/release/app
objcopy --add-gnu-debuglink target/release/app{.d,}
```

If you don't want to strip the binary, you should disable the `debug-images` integration of the SDK, as otherwise you will run into the issue documented [here](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-rust/issues/470#issuecomment-1472136215) which could cause duplicated frames to appear in your Sentry issues.

Use Sentry CLI to upload debug information and source files:

```bash	
sentry-cli debug-files upload --include-sources .
```
