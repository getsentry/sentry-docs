## Prerequisites

[Install](/cli/installation/) and [Configure](/cli/configuration/) Sentry CLI by providing an auth token, org and project.

Then, enable full debug information for your release build:
```toml {filename:Cargo.toml}
[profiles.release]
debug = true
```

We will strip the binary, extract the necessary debug information and upload it to Sentry along with the source code.

## Upload debug information files and source code

Build the release binary, strip and extract debug information:
```bash
cargo build --release
objcopy --only-keep-debug target/release/app{,.d}
objcopy --strip-debug --strip-unneeded target/release/app
objcopy --add-gnu-debuglink target/release/app{.d,}
zip app-debug.zip target/release/app.d
```

Use Sentry CLI to create a source bundle:

```bash
sentry-cli difutil bundle-sources target/release/app.d
mv target/release/app.src.zip ./app.src.zip
```

Finally, use Sentry CLI to upload both debug information files and sources to Sentry:
```bash
sentry-cli upload-dif ./app-debug.zip ./app.src.zip
```
