## Prerequisites

[Install](/cli/installation/) and [Configure](/cli/configuration/) Sentry CLI by providing an auth token, org and project.

## Compile and create debug information files

### Linux

Enable full debug information for your release build:
```toml {filename:Cargo.toml}
[profile.release]
debug = true
```

Build the release binary, extract debug information and strip it from the binary:
```bash
cargo build --release
objcopy --only-keep-debug target/release/app{,.d}
objcopy --strip-debug --strip-unneeded target/release/app
objcopy --add-gnu-debuglink target/release/app{.d,}
```

### macOS

Use a profile like the following for your release builds:
```toml {filename:Cargo.toml}
[profile.release]
debug = true
split-debuginfo = "packed"
strip = true
```

Build the release binary, debug information will be available in separate files and stripped from the binary automatically:
```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Upload debug information and source files

Use Sentry CLI to upload debug information and source files:

```bash	
sentry-cli debug-files upload --include-sources .
```

## Troubleshooting

If you don't want to strip the binary, you should disable the `debug-images` integration of the SDK, as otherwise you will run into the issue documented [here](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-rust/issues/470#issuecomment-1472136215) which could cause duplicated frames to appear in your Sentry issues.
