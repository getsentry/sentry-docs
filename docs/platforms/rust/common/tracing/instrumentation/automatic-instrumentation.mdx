Capturing transactions requires that you first <PlatformLink to="/tracing/">set up tracing</PlatformLink> if you haven't already.

## `tracing` Integration

The Rust SDK offers an integration for the `tracing` ecosystem that will track spans automatically for every function that is annotated with `#[tracing::instrument]`.

The integration takes care of starting a new transaction or a new child span of an already running transaction, and it automatically sets the created span as the _current_ span.

```rust
fn main() {
    tracing_subscriber::Registry::default()
        .with(sentry::integrations::tracing::layer())
        .init();

    let _sentry = sentry::init(sentry::ClientOptions {
        release: sentry::release_name!(),
        traces_sample_rate: 1.0,
        ..Default::default()
    });

    main_span1();
}

#[tracing::instrument]
fn main_span1() {
    thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(50));

    main_span2()
}

#[tracing::instrument]
fn main_span2() {
    thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(200));
}
```

## HTTP Instrumentation

The Sentry SDK offers an integration for the `tower` ecosystem which can automatically continue a trace from an incoming HTTP request.

When combining both layers, order matters. For example, with tower::ServiceBuilder, you must define the Hub layer before the Http one, like so:

```rust
use sentry_tower::{NewSentryLayer, SentryHttpLayer};
use tower::ServiceBuilder;

let layer = ServiceBuilder::new()
    .layer(NewSentryLayer::new_from_top())
    .layer(SentryHttpLayer::with_transaction());
```
