To start debugging any SDK issue, enable debug mode by setting `debug: true` in the `ClientOptions` struct you pass to `sentry::init`.
This will make the SDK log additional debug information on stderr.

Below is a list of common problems and how to solve them.

## General

<Expandable title="Panic on SDK initialization">
The SDK has been reported to panic on initialization when using the `debug-images` feature on machines with specific versions of the Linux kernel due to an issue with one of its dependencies.

Please open a GitHub [issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-rust/issues/new/choose) with your OS and kernel version if you're affected by this.

<Expandable title="Duplicated stack frames">
There's an issue where stack frames can appear to be duplicated in Sentry with respect to the real stack trace.
As there's a currently a hard limit of 200 frames in ingestion, this can cause errors to be missing stack frames when the limit is exceeded.
This happens when the stack trace is already symbolicated on the client (due to debug information being present at runtime) but gets resymbolicated on the server.

There are two alternative ways to address this problem:
- keep debug information in the binary, but disable the `debug-images` feature of the `sentry` crate;
- strip debug information from the binary, and [upload debug files](/platforms/rust/source-context/#compile-and-create-debug-information-files) separately.

<Expandable title="'This frame has an unknown problem and can not be symbolicated' error in the UI for application stack frames">
This can happen when your executable doesn't have a build ID, and therefore stack frames cannot be associated with any debug files by the Sentry backend.

To ensure `cargo` embeds a build ID in your binary, set the following environment variable when building: `RUSTFLAGS="-Clink-args=-Wl,--build-id"`.
