With Sentry Structured Logs, you can send text based log information from your applications to Sentry. Once in Sentry, these logs can be viewed alongside relevant errors, searched by text-string, or searched using their individual attributes.

## Requirements

Logs in Rust are supported in Sentry Rust SDK version `0.39.0` and above.
Additionally, the `logs` feature flag needs to be enabled.

```toml {filename:Cargo.toml}
[dependencies]
sentry = { version = "{{@inject packages.version('sentry.rust') }}", features = ["logs"] }
```

## Setup

To enable logging, you need to initialize the SDK with the `enable_logs` option set to `true`.

```rust
let _guard = sentry::init(("___PUBLIC_DSN___", sentry::ClientOptions {
    release: sentry::release_name!(),
    enable_logs: true,
    ..Default::default()
}));
```

## Usage

Once the feature is enabled on the SDK and the SDK is initialized, you can send logs by using the logging macros.
The `sentry` crate exposes macros that support six different log levels:
`logger_trace`, `logger_debug`, `logger_info`, `logger_warn`, `logger_error` and `logger_fatal`.
The macros support logging a simple message, or a message with parameters, with `format` syntax:

```rust
use sentry::logger_info;

logger_info!("Hello, world!");
logger_info!("Hello, {}!", "world");
```

You can also log additional attributes using the `key = value` syntax before the message:

```rust
use sentry::logger_error;

logger_error!(
    database.host = "prod-db-01",
    database.port = 5432,
    database.name = "user_service",
    retry_attempt = 2,
    beta_features = false,
    "Database connection failed"
);
```

The supported attribute keys consist of any number of valid Rust identifiers, separated by dots.
Attributes containing dots will be nested under their common prefix when displayed in the UI.

The supported attribute values correspond to the values that can be converted to a `serde_json::Value`,
which include primitive types for numbers, `bool`, and string types.
As of today, array and object types will be converted to strings using their JSON representation.

## Integrations

We're actively working on adding integration support for Logs.
Currently, we're looking at adding support for the `tracing` and `log` crates.
You can follow progress on the following GitHub issues or open a [new one](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-rust/issues/new/choose) for any additional integration you would like to see.
- [`tracing`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-rust/issues/799)
- [`log`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-rust/issues/818)

## Options

### `before_send_log`

To filter logs, or update them before they are sent to Sentry, you can use the `before_send_log` client option.

```rust
let _guard = sentry::init(("___PUBLIC_DSN___", sentry::ClientOptions {
    release: sentry::release_name!(),
    enable_logs: true,
    before_send_log: Some(std::sync::Arc::new(|log| {
        // filter out all trace level logs
        if log.level == sentry::protocol::LogLevel::Trace {
            return None;
        }
        Some(log)
    })),
    ..Default::default()
}));
```
