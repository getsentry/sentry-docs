With Sentry Structured Logs, you can send text based log information from your applications to Sentry. Once in Sentry, these logs can be viewed alongside relevant errors, searched by text-string, or searched using their individual attributes.

## Requirements

Logs in Rust are supported in Sentry Rust SDK version `0.39.0` and above.
Additionally, the `logs` feature flag needs to be enabled.

```toml {filename:Cargo.toml}
[dependencies]
sentry = { version = "{{@inject packages.version('sentry.rust') }}", features = ["logs"] }
```

## Setup

To enable logging, you need to initialize the SDK with the `enable_logs` option set to `true`.

```rust
let _guard = sentry::init((
    "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    sentry::ClientOptions {
        release: sentry::release_name!(),
        enable_logs: true,
        ..Default::default()
    }
));
```

## Usage

Once the feature is enabled on the SDK and the SDK is initialized, you can send logs by using the logging macros.
The `sentry` crate exposes macros that support six different log levels:
`logger_trace`, `logger_debug`, `logger_info`, `logger_warn`, `logger_error` and `logger_fatal`.
The macros support logging a simple message, or a message with parameters, with `format` syntax:

```rust
use sentry::logger_info;

logger_info!("Hello, world!");
logger_info!("Hello, {}!", "world");
```

You can also attach additional attributes to a log using the `key = value` syntax before the message:

```rust
use sentry::logger_error;

logger_error!(
    database.host = "prod-db-01",
    database.port = 5432,
    database.name = "user_service",
    retry_attempt = 2,
    beta_features = false,
    "Database connection failed"
);
```

The supported attribute keys consist of any number of valid Rust identifiers, separated by dots.
Attributes containing dots will be nested under their common prefix when displayed in the UI.

The supported attribute values correspond to the values that can be converted to a `serde_json::Value`,
which include primitive types for numbers, `bool`, and string types.
As of today, array and object types will be converted to strings using their JSON representation.

## Integrations

### `tracing` Integration

To use the `tracing` integration with logs, add the necessary dependencies to your `Cargo.toml`.

```toml {filename:Cargo.toml}
[dependencies]
sentry = { version = "{{@inject packages.version('sentry.rust') }}", features = ["tracing", "logs"] }
tracing = "0.1.41"
tracing-subscriber = "0.3.19"
```

Initialize the SDK with `enable_logs` set to `true`, and configure the `tracing` subscriber to map `tracing` events to logs based on metadata such as severity.
Then, use standard `tracing` macros to capture logs.

```rust {filename:main.rs}
use sentry::integrations::tracing::EventFilter;
use tracing::{error, info, warn};
use tracing_subscriber::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    let _guard = sentry::init((
        "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
        sentry::ClientOptions {
            release: sentry::release_name!(),
            enable_logs: true,
            ..Default::default()
        },
    ));

    let sentry_layer =
        sentry::integrations::tracing::layer().event_filter(|md| match *md.level() {
            // Capture error level events as Sentry events
            // These are grouped into issues, representing high-severity errors to act upon
            tracing::Level::ERROR => EventFilter::Event,
            // Ignore trace level events, as they're too verbose
            tracing::Level::TRACE => EventFilter::Ignore,
            // Capture everything else as a traditional structured log
            _ => EventFilter::Log,
        });

    tracing_subscriber::registry()
        .with(tracing_subscriber::fmt::layer())
        .with(sentry_layer)
        .init();

    info!("Hello, world!");

    warn!(
        database.host = "prod-db-01",
        database.port = 5432,
        retry_attempt = 2,
        "Database connection slow"
    );

    error!(error_code = 500, "Critical system failure");
}
```

The fields of `tracing` events are automatically captured as attributes in Sentry logs.

To map a `tracing` event to multiple items in Sentry (e.g. both an event and a log), combine multiple event filters using the bitwise or operator.

```rust
use sentry::integrations::tracing::EventFilter;

let sentry_layer =
    sentry::integrations::tracing::layer().event_filter(|md| match *md.level() {
        // Capture error and warn level events as both logs and events in Sentry
        tracing::Level::ERROR | tracing::Level::WARN => EventFilter::Event | EventFilter::Log,
        // Ignore trace level events, as they're too verbose
        tracing::Level::TRACE => EventFilter::Ignore,
        // Capture everything else just as a log
        _ => EventFilter::Log,
    });
```

### `log` Integration

To use the `log` integration with logs, add the necessary dependencies to your `Cargo.toml`.

```toml {filename:Cargo.toml}
[dependencies]
sentry = { version = "{{@inject packages.version('sentry.rust') }}", features = ["log", "logs"] }
log = "0.4"
# optional: use any log implementation you prefer
env_logger = "0.11"
```

Initialize the SDK with `enable_logs` set to `true`, and configure the `log` integration to map `log` records to logs based on metadata such as severity.
Then, use standard `log` macros to capture logs.

```rust {filename:main.rs}
use sentry_log::LogFilter;
use log::{info, warn, error};

fn main() {
    let _guard = sentry::init((
        "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
        sentry::ClientOptions {
            release: sentry::release_name!(),
            enable_logs: true,
            ..Default::default()
        },
    ));

    let logger = sentry::integrations::log::SentryLogger::with_dest(
        env_logger::Builder::from_default_env().build(),
    )
    .filter(|md| match md.level() {
        // Capture error records as Sentry events
        // These are grouped into issues, representing high-severity errors to act upon
        log::Level::Error => LogFilter::Event,
        // Ignore trace level records, as they're too verbose
        log::Level::Trace => LogFilter::Ignore,
        // Capture everything else as a log
        _ => LogFilter::Log,
    });

    log::set_boxed_logger(Box::new(logger)).unwrap();
    log::set_max_level(log::LevelFilter::Trace);

    info!("Hello, world!");
    warn!("Database connection slow");
    error!("Critical system failure");
}
```

### Additional Integrations

We're always looking to expand integration support for Logs.
If you'd like to see support for additional logging libraries, please open a [new issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-rust/issues/new/choose) with your request.

## Options

### `before_send_log`

To filter logs, or update them before they are sent to Sentry, you can use the `before_send_log` client option.

```rust
let _guard = sentry::init(("___PUBLIC_DSN___", sentry::ClientOptions {
    release: sentry::release_name!(),
    enable_logs: true,
    before_send_log: Some(std::sync::Arc::new(|log| {
        // filter out all trace level logs
        if log.level == sentry::protocol::LogLevel::Trace {
            return None;
        }
        Some(log)
    })),
    ..Default::default()
}));
```
