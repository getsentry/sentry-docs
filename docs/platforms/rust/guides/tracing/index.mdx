The Sentry SDK offers an integration for tokio's [tracing](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing) ecosystem that supports:

- Reporting `tracing` events to Sentry as events, breadcrumbs, or logs.
- Reporting `tracing` spans to Sentry.
- Reporting errors and panics with the correct trace correlation.

## Install

<OnboardingOptionButtons
  options={["error-monitoring", "performance", "logs"]}
/>

To add Sentry with the `tracing` integration to your Rust project, add the necessary dependencies to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml {filename:Cargo.toml}
[dependencies]
tracing = "0.1.41"
tracing-subscriber = "0.3.19"
sentry = { version = "{{@inject packages.version('sentry.rust') }}", features = [
  "tracing",
  # ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ logs
  "logs",
  # ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ logs
] }
tokio = { version = "1.45.0", features = ["full"] }
```

## Configure

Initialize the Sentry SDK and register the Sentry layer to start sending `tracing` events and spans to Sentry:

<Alert level="warning">

Macros like `#[tokio::main]` and `#[actix_web::main]` are not supported. The Sentry client must be initialized before the async runtime is started, as shown below.

</Alert>

```rust
use tracing_subscriber::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    // Initialize Sentry
    let _guard = sentry::init((
        "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
        sentry::ClientOptions {
            release: sentry::release_name!(),
            # ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ performance
            // Capture all traces and spans. Set to a lower value in production
            traces_sample_rate: 1.0,
            # ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ performance
            # ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ logs
            enable_logs:true
            # ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ logs
            ..sentry::ClientOptions::default()
        },
    });

    // Register the Sentry tracing layer
    tracing_subscriber::registry()
        .with(tracing_subscriber::fmt::layer())
        .with(sentry::integrations::tracing::layer())
        .init();
        
    tokio::runtime::Builder::new_multi_thread()
        .enable_all()
        .build()?
        .block_on(async {
            // Futures should to be bound to a Hub
            // Learn more at https://docs.rs/sentry-core/latest/sentry_core/#parallelism-concurrency-and-async
            fail().bind_hub(sentry::Hub::current()).await;
        });
}

# ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ performance
#[tracing::instrument] // Captures a root span (transaction) around this function execution
# ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ performance
async fn fail() {
    tracing::debug!("Doing work"); // Adds a breadrcumb
    # ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ performance
    let _span = tracing::info_span("Child span").entered(); // Captures a child span
    # ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ performance
    tracing::error!("Everything is on fire!");
}
```

By default, error level events are captured as Sentry events, while anything at or above info is added as a breadcrumb.

{/* ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ logs */}

To capture structured logs for `tracing` events instead, you need to set up the Sentry layer with a custom event filter that maps to logs, like so:

```rust
use sentry::integrations::tracing::EventFilter;

sentry::integrations::tracing::layer().event_filter(|md| match *md.level() {
    // Capture error level events as Sentry events
    tracing::Level::ERROR => EventFilter::Event,
    // Ignore trace level events, as they're too verbose
    tracing::Level::TRACE => EventFilter::Ignore,
    // Capture everything else as a structured log
    _ => EventFilter::Log,
});
```

{/* ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ logs */}

</Alert>

To view and resolve the recorded error, log into [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and select your project. Select Issues, and then Errors & Outages in the sidebar, where you will find the newly created issue. Clicking on the issue's title will open a page where you can see detailed information and mark it as resolved.
