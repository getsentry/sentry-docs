The Sentry SDK offers an integration for tokio's [tracing](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing) ecosystem that supports:

- Reporting `tracing` events to Sentry as events, breadcrumbs, or logs.
- Reporting `tracing` spans to Sentry.
- Reporting errors and panics with the correct trace correlation.

## Install

<OnboardingOptionButtons
  options={["error-monitoring", "performance", "logs"]}
/>

To add Sentry with the `tracing` integration to your Rust project, add the necessary dependencies to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml {filename:Cargo.toml}
[dependencies]
tracing = "0.1.41"
tracing-subscriber = "0.3.19"
sentry = { version = "{{@inject packages.version('sentry.rust') }}", features = [
  "tracing",
  # ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ logs
  "logs",
  # ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ logs
] }
tokio = { version = "1.45.0", features = ["full"] }
```

## Configure

Initialize the Sentry SDK and register the Sentry layer to start sending `tracing` events and spans to Sentry:

<Alert level="warning">

Macros like `#[tokio::main]` and `#[actix_web::main]` are not supported. The Sentry client must be initialized before the async runtime is started, as shown below.

</Alert>

```rust
use tracing_subscriber::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    // Initialize Sentry
    let _guard = sentry::init((
        "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
        sentry::ClientOptions {
            release: sentry::release_name!(),
            # ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ performance
            // Capture all traces and spans. Set to a lower value in production
            traces_sample_rate: 1.0,
            # ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ performance
            # ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ logs
            enable_logs:true
            # ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ logs
            ..sentry::ClientOptions::default()
        },
    });

    // Register the Sentry tracing layer
    tracing_subscriber::registry()
        .with(tracing_subscriber::fmt::layer())
        .with(sentry::integrations::tracing::layer())
        .init();

    tokio::runtime::Builder::new_multi_thread()
        .enable_all()
        .build()?
        .block_on(async {
            // Futures should to be bound to a Hub
            // Learn more at https://docs.rs/sentry-core/latest/sentry_core/#parallelism-concurrency-and-async
            fail().bind_hub(sentry::Hub::current()).await;
        });
}

# ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ performance
#[tracing::instrument] // Captures a root span (transaction) around this function execution
# ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ performance
async fn fail() {
    tracing::debug!("Doing work"); // Adds a breadrcumb
    # ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ performance
    let _span = tracing::info_span("Child span").entered(); // Captures a child span
    # ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ performance
    tracing::error!("Everything is on fire!");
}
```

By default, error level events from `tokio-rs/tracing` are captured as Sentry events, while anything at or above info level is added as a breadcrumb.

Additionally, if the `logs` feature flag of the `sentry` crate is enabled and the SDK is initialized with `enable_logs: true`, then events from `tokio-rs/tracing` at info level or above are also captured as [structured logs](https://docs.sentry.io/product/explore/logs/).

This behavior can be customized by applying a custom `event_filter` when creating the layer.
The following snippet shows the default `event_filter` that's applied when using the `sentry` crate with the `logs` feature flag.

```rust
use sentry::integrations::tracing::EventFilter;

let sentry_layer =
    sentry::integrations::tracing::layer().event_filter(|md| match *md.level() {
        // Capture error and warn level events as both logs and events in Sentry
        tracing::Level::ERROR => EventFilter::Event | EventFilter::Log,
        // Ignore trace level events, as they're too verbose
        tracing::Level::TRACE => EventFilter::Ignore,
        // Capture everything else as both a breadcrumb and a log
        _ => EventFilter::Breadcrumb | EventFilter::Log,
    });
```

To view and resolve the recorded error, log into [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and select your project. Select Issues, and then Errors & Outages in the sidebar, where you will find the newly created issue. Clicking on the issue's title will open a page where you can see detailed information and mark it as resolved.

If you're using tracing (the Sentry feature), you can view the recorded traces and spans by selecting Explore, and then Traces in the sidebar.

If you're using logs, you can view the recorded logs by selecting Explore, and then Logs in the sidebar.
