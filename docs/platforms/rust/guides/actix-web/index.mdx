description: "Learn about monitoring your Actix Web application with Sentry."

The Sentry SDK offers a middleware for the [Actix Web](https://actix.rs/) framework that supports:

- Capturing server errors returned by Actix Web services.
- Starting a [transaction](https://docs.sentry.io/concepts/key-terms/tracing/) for each request-response cycle.

## Install

To add Sentry with the Actix Web integration to your Rust project, just add a new dependency to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml {filename:Cargo.toml} 
[dependencies]
actix-web = "4.11.0"
sentry = { version = "{{@inject packages.version('sentry.rust') }}", features = ["actix"] }
```

## Configure

Initialize and configure the Sentry client. This will enable a set of default integrations, such as panic reporting.
Then, initialize Actix Web with the Sentry middleware.

<Alert level="warning">

Macros like `#[tokio::main]` and `#[actix_web::main]` are not supported. The Sentry client must be initialized before the async runtime is started, as shown below.

</Alert>

```rust {filename:main.rs}
use std::io;

use actix_web::{get, App, Error, HttpRequest, HttpServer};

#[get("/")]
async fn failing(_req: HttpRequest) -> Result<String, Error> {
    Err(io::Error::new(io::ErrorKind::Other, "An error happens here").into())
}

fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    let _guard = sentry::init((
        "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
        sentry::ClientOptions {
            release: sentry::release_name!(),
            // Capture all traces and spans. Set to a lower value in production
            traces_sample_rate: 1.0,
            // Capture user IPs and potentially sensitive headers when using HTTP server integrations
            // see https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/rust/data-management/data-collected for more info
            send_default_pii: true,
            // Capture all HTTP request bodies, regardless of size
            max_request_body_size: sentry::MaxRequestBodySize::Always,
            ..Default::default()
        },
    ));

    actix_web::rt::System::new().block_on(async {
        HttpServer::new(|| {
            App::new()
                .wrap(
                    sentry::integrations::actix::Sentry::builder()
                        .capture_server_errors(true) // Capture server errors
                        .start_transaction(true) // Start a transaction (Sentry root span) for each request
                        .finish(),
                )
                .service(failing)
        })
        .bind("127.0.0.1:3001")?
        .run()
        .await
    })?;

    Ok(())
}
```

## Verify

The snippet above sets up a service that always fails, so you can test that everything is working as soon as you set it up.

Send a request to the application. The response error will be captured by Sentry.

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/
```

<Alert>

Learn more about manually capturing an error or message in our <PlatformLink to="/usage/">Usage documentation</PlatformLink>.

</Alert>

To view and resolve the recorded error, log into [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and select your project. Clicking on the error's title will open a page where you can see detailed information and mark it as resolved.
