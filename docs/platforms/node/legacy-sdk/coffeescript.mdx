<Alert level="warning" title="Deprecation Warning">

A new Node SDK has superseded this deprecated version. Sentry preserves this documentation for customers using the old client. We recommend using the [updated Node SDK](/platforms/node/) for your projects.

</Alert>

In order to use raven-node with coffee-script or another library which overwrites Error.prepareStackTrace you might run into the exception “Traceback does not support Error.prepareStackTrace being defined already.”

In order to not have raven-node (and the underlying raw stack trace library) require Traceback you can pass your own stackFunction in the options. For example:

<SignInNote />

```coffeescript
client = new raven.Client('___PUBLIC_DSN___', {
    stackFunction: {{ Your stack function }}
});
```

So for example:

```coffeescript
client = new raven.Client('___PUBLIC_DSN___', {
    stackFunction: Error.prepareStackTrace
});
```
