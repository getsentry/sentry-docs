If you need help solving issues with your Sentry JavaScript SDK integration, you can read the edge cases documented below. If you need additional help, you can [ask on GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/new/choose). Customers on a paid plan may also contact support.

## Updating to a New Sentry SDK Version

If you update your Sentry SDK to a new major version, you might encounter breaking changes that need some adaption on your end.
Check out our [migration guide](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/master/MIGRATION.md) to learn everything you need
to know to get up and running again with the latest Sentry features.

## Debugging Additional Data

You can view the JSON payload of an event to see how Sentry stores additional data in the event. The shape of the data may not exactly match the description.

![Red box highlighting where to find the JSON connected to an event](/platforms/javascript/common/troubleshooting/event_JSON.png)

For more details, see the [full documentation on Event Payload](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/event-payloads/).

## Max JSON Payload Size

`maxValueLength` has a default value of 250, but you can adjust this value according to your needs if your messages are longer. Please note that not every single value is affected by this option.

## Third Party Promise Libraries

When you include and configure Sentry, our JavaScript SDK automatically attaches global handlers to _capture_ uncaught exceptions and unhandled promise rejections. You can disable this default behavior by changing the `onunhandledrejection` option to `false` in your GlobalHandlers integration and manually hook into each event handler, then call `Sentry.captureException` or `Sentry.captureMessage` directly.

You may also need to manage your configuration if you are using a third-party library to implement promises. Also, remember that browsers often implement security measures that can block error reporting when serving script files from different origins.

## Events With "Non-Error Exception"

If you’re seeing errors with the message “Non-Error exception (or promise rejection) captured with keys: x, y, z.”, this happens when you a) call `Sentry.captureException()` with a plain object, b) throw a plain object, or c) reject a promise with a plain object.

You can see the contents of the non-Error object in question in the `__serialized__` entry of the “Additional Data” section.

To get better insight into these error events, we recommend finding where the plain object is being passed or thrown to Sentry based on the contents of the `__serialized__` data, and then turning the plain object into an Error object.

## Build Errors With Vite

If you're using the [Vite Bundler](https://vitejs.dev/) and a Sentry NPM package, and you see the following error:

```
Error: Could not resolve './{}.js' from node_modules/@sentry/utils/esm/index.js
```

This might be because the [`define`](https://vitejs.dev/config/shared-options.html#define) option in your Vite config is string-replacing some variable used by the Sentry SDK, like `global`, which causes build errors. Vite recommends using `define` for CONSTANTS only, and not putting `process` or `global` into the options. To fix this build error, remove or update your `define` option, as shown below:

```diff {filename:vite.config.ts}
export default defineConfig({
   build: {
     sourcemap: true
   },
-  define: {
-    global: {}
-  },
   plugins: [react()]
})
```
