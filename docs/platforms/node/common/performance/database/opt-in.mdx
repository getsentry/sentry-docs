## Prisma ORM Integration

_(Available from `7.0.0`)_

Sentry supports tracing [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/) fetchers with Prisma integration. This integration is an opt-in feature and requires that a `PrismaClient` instance is provided.

Prisma integration creates a `db.prisma` span for each query and reports to Sentry with relevant details inside `description` if available.

For example:

<SignInNote />

```javascript
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/node";

const client = new PrismaClient();

Sentry.init({
  dsn: ___PUBLIC_DSN___,
  release: "1.0",
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  integrations: [new Sentry.Integrations.Prisma({ client })],
});
```

## GraphQL Integration

_(Available from `7.2.0`)_

Sentry supports the tracing GraphQL execution process with an opt-in tracing integration. It creates a `db.graphql` transaction for each GraphQL process that may contain one or more resolvers.

This integration doesn't work on the resolver level, but instead provides a single transaction that covers the whole execution of a GraphQL process.
If you use Apollo Server to define your GraphQL resolvers, Sentry's Apollo Server integration can be combined with this integration to get more precise resolver-level hierarchical tracing data.

For example:

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/node";

Sentry.init({
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  integrations: [new Sentry.Integrations.GraphQL()],
});
```

## Apollo Server Integration

_(Available from `7.2.0`)_

Sentry provides an opt-in tracing integration for [Apollo resolvers](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/data/resolvers/). It supports nested resolvers, and also works well with the other `@sentry/node` database tracing integrations when there are database operations inside resolvers.

The Apollo integration creates `db.graphql.apollo` spans for each resolver and reports to Sentry with a `description` containing the resolver's name and group:

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/node";

Sentry.init({
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  integrations: [new Sentry.Integrations.Apollo()],
});
```

If you use `NestJs`, initialize the integration with the `useNestjs` option

```javascript
new Sentry.Integrations.Apollo({ useNestjs: true });
```

**Known Limitation:**
This integration does not support Apollo servers where the schema was loaded using the `schema` property (`new ApolloServer({ schema: ... })`).
