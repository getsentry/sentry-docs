## User Feedback API

The user feedback API allows you to collect user feedback while utilizing your own UI. You can use the same programming language you have in your app to send user feedback. In this case, the SDK creates the HTTP request so you don't have to deal with posting data via HTTP.

Sentry pairs the feedback with the original event, giving you additional insight into issues. Sentry needs the `eventId` to be able to associate the user feedback to the corresponding event. For example, to get the `eventId`, you can use <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#before-send"><PlatformIdentifier name="before-send" /></PlatformLink> or the return value of the method capturing an event.

<PlatformContent includePath="user-feedback/sdk-api-example/" />

Alternatively, you can use the [User Feedback API endpoint](/api/projects/submit-user-feedback/) directly.

## Crash-Report Modal

Our embeddable, JavaScript-based, Crash-Report modal is useful when you would typically render a plain error page (the classic `500.html`) on your website.

To collect feedback, the Crash-Report modal requests and collects the user's name, email address, and a description of what occurred. When feedback is provided, Sentry pairs the feedback with the original event, giving you additional insights into issues.

The screenshot below provides an example of the Crash-Report modal, though yours may differ depending on your customization:

### Integration

The modal authenticates with your public DSN, then passes in the Event ID that was generated on your backend.

<PlatformContent includePath="user-feedback/example-widget/" />
