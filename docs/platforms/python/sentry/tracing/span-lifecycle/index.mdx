<Alert>

To capture transactions and spans customized to your organization's needs, you must first <PlatformLink to="/tracing/">set up tracing.</PlatformLink>

</Alert>

To add custom performance data to your application, you need to add custom instrumentation in the form of [spans](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/distributed-tracing/#traces-transactions-and-spans). Spans are a way to measure the time it takes for a specific action to occur. For example, you can create a span to measure the time it takes for a function to execute.

## Span Lifecycle

In Python, spans are typically created using a context manager, which automatically manages the span's lifecycle. When you create a span using a context manager, the span automatically starts when entering the context and ends when exiting it. This is the recommended approach for most scenarios.

```python
import sentry_sdk

# Start a span for a task
with sentry_sdk.start_span(op="task", name="Create User"):
    # Your code here
    # The span will automatically end when exiting this block
    user = create_user(email="user@example.com")
    send_welcome_email(user)
    # The span automatically ends here when the 'with' block exits
```

You can call the context manager's `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods to more explicitly control the span's lifecycle.

## Span Context and Nesting

When you create a span, it becomes the child of the current active span. This allows you to build a hierarchy of spans that represent the execution path of your application:

```python
import sentry_sdk

with sentry_sdk.start_span(op="process", name="Process Data"):
    # This code is tracked in the "Process Data" span
    
    with sentry_sdk.start_span(op="task", name="Validate Input"):
        # This is now a child span of "Process Data"
        validate_data()
    
    with sentry_sdk.start_span(op="task", name="Transform Data"):
        # Another child span
        transform_data()
```

## Span Starting Options

The following options can be used when creating spans:

| Option        | Type            | Description                                     |
| ------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `op`          | `string`        | The operation of the span.                      |
| `name`        | `string`        | The name of the span.                           |
| `start_timestamp`  | `datetime/float`| The start time of the span.                     |

## Using the Context Manager

For most scenarios, we recommend using the context manager approach with `sentry_sdk.start_span()`. This creates a new span that automatically starts when entering the context and ends when exiting it.

```python
import sentry_sdk

with sentry_sdk.start_span(op="db", name="Query Users") as span:
    # Perform a database query
    users = db.query("SELECT * FROM users")
    
    # You can set data on the span
    span.set_data("user_count", len(users))
```

The context manager also correctly handles exceptions, marking the span as failed if an exception occurs:

```python
import sentry_sdk

try:
    with sentry_sdk.start_span(op="http", name="Call External API"):
        # If this raises an exception, the span will be marked as failed
        response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/data")
        response.raise_for_status()
except Exception:
    # The span is already marked as failed and has ended
    pass
```

## Getting the Current Span

You can access the currently active span using `sentry_sdk.get_current_span()`:

```python
import sentry_sdk

# Get the current active span
current_span = sentry_sdk.get_current_span()
if current_span:
    current_span.set_data("key", "value")
```

## Working with Transactions

[Transactions](/product/insights/overview/transaction-summary/#what-is-a-transaction) are a special type of span that represent a complete operation in your application, such as a web request. You can create transactions explicitly:

```python
import sentry_sdk

with sentry_sdk.start_transaction(name="Background Task", op="task") as transaction:
    # Your code here
    
    # You can add child spans to the transaction
    with sentry_sdk.start_span(op="subtask", name="Data Processing"):
        # Process data
        pass
```

## Improving Span Data

### Adding Span Attributes

Span attributes customize information you can get through tracing. This information can be found in the traces views in Sentry, once you drill into a span. You can capture additional context with span attributes. These can be key-value pairs of various Python types.

```python
import sentry_sdk

with sentry_sdk.start_span(op="db", name="Query Users") as span:
    # Execute the query
    users = db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE active = true")
    
    # You can add more data during execution
    span.set_data("result_count", len(users))
```

You can also add attributes to an existing span:

```python
import sentry_sdk

# Get the current span
span = sentry_sdk.get_current_span()
if span:
    # Set individual data points
    span.set_data("user_id", user.id)
    span.set_data("request_size", len(request.body))
```

### Adding Attributes to All Spans

To add attributes to all spans, use the `before_send_transaction` callback:

```python
import sentry_sdk

def before_send_transaction(event):
    # Add attributes to the root span (transaction)
    if "trace" in event.get("contexts", {}):
        if "data" not in event["contexts"]["trace"]:
            event["contexts"]["trace"]["data"] = {}
        
        event["contexts"]["trace"]["data"].update({
            "app_version": "1.2.3",
            "environment_region": "us-west-2"
        })
    
    # Add attributes to all child spans
    for span in event.get("spans", []):
        if "data" not in span:
            span["data"] = {}
        
        span["data"].update({
            "component_version": "2.0.0",
            "deployment_stage": "production"
        })
    
    return event

sentry_sdk.init(
    # Your other Sentry configuration options here
    before_send_transaction=before_send_transaction
)
```

### Adding Span Operations ("op")

Spans can have an operation associated with them, which helps Sentry understand the context of the span. For example, database related spans have the `db` operation, while HTTP requests use `http.client`.

Sentry maintains a [list of well-known span operations](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/performance/span-operations/#list-of-operations) that you should use when applicable:

```python
import sentry_sdk

# HTTP client operation
with sentry_sdk.start_span(op="http.client", name="Fetch User Data"):
    response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/users")

# Database operation
with sentry_sdk.start_span(op="db", name="Save User"):
        db.execute(
        "INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES (%s, %s)", 
        (user.name, user.email),
    )

# File I/O operation
with sentry_sdk.start_span(op="file.read", name="Read Config"):
    with open("config.json", "r") as f:
        config = json.load(f)
```

### Updating the Span Status

You can update the status of a span to indicate whether it succeeded or failed:

```python
import sentry_sdk

with sentry_sdk.start_span(op="task", name="Process Payment") as span:
    try:
        result = process_payment(payment_id)
        if result.success:
            # Mark the span as successful
            span.set_status("ok")
        else:
            # Mark the span as failed
            span.set_status("error")
            span.set_data("error_reason", result.error)
    except Exception:
        # Span will automatically be marked as failed when an exception occurs
        raise
```
