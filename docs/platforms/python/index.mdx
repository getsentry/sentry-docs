## Prerequisites

* You need a Sentry [account](https://sentry.io/signup/) and [project](/product/projects/)
* Read one of our dedicated guides if you use any of the <PlatformLink to="/integrations/#web-frameworks">frameworks</PlatformLink> we support

## Features

<p className="mb-5">Select which Sentry features you'd like to install in addition to Error Monitoring to get the corresponding installation and configuration instructions below.</p>

## Install

Install the Sentry SDK using [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):

```bash
pip install --upgrade sentry-sdk
```

## Configure

Configuration should happen as **early as possible** in your application's lifecycle.



```python
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    # Add request headers and IP for users,
    # see https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/data-management/data-collected/ for more info
    send_default_pii=True,
    # ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ performance
    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for tracing.
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
    # ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ performance
    # ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ profiling
    # Set profiles_sample_rate to 1.0 to profile 100%
    # of sampled transactions.
    # We recommend adjusting this value in production.
    profiles_sample_rate=1.0,
    # ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ profiling
)
```

However, in async applications, you need to call `sentry_sdk.init()` inside an `async` function to ensure async code is instrumented properly. We recommend calling `sentry_sdk.init()` at the beginning of the first `async` function you call, as demonstrated in the example below.

```python
import asyncio
import sentry_sdk

async def main():
    sentry_sdk.init(
        ...  # same as above
    )

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Verify

Add this intentional error to your application to test that everything is working right away.

```py
division_by_zero = 1 / 0
```

<Alert>

Learn more about manually capturing an error or message in our <PlatformLink to="/usage/">Usage documentation</PlatformLink>.

</Alert>

To view and resolve the recorded error, log into [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and select your project. Clicking on the error's title will open a page where you can see detailed information and mark it as resolved.

<Alert>

Not seeing your error in Sentry? Make sure you're running the above example from a file and not from a Python shell like IPython.
