Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your applicationâ€™s runtime.

## Configure

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-config" />

## Verify

Add this intentional error to your application to test that everything is working right away.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-verify" />

<Note>

Learn more about manually capturing an error or message in our <PlatformLink to="/usage/">Usage documentation</PlatformLink>.

</Note>

To view and resolve the recorded error, log into [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and open your project. Clicking on the error's title will open a page where you can see detailed information and mark it as resolved.

Not seeing your error in Sentry? Make sure you're running the above example from a file and not from a Python shell like IPython.
