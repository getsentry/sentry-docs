## Features

In addition to capturing errors, you can monitor interactions between multiple services or applications by [enabling tracing](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/). 

Send <PlatformLink to="/platforms/python/logs/">structured logs</PlatformLink> to Sentry and correlate them with errors and traces.

Select which Sentry features you'd like to configure to get the corresponding setup instructions below.

<OnboardingOptionButtons
  options={[
    {id: "error-monitoring", checked: true, disabled: true},
    {id: "performance", checked: true},
    {id: "logs", checked: true},
  ]}
/>

## Install

Install the Sentry SDK using [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):

```bash {tabTitle:pip}
pip install "sentry-sdk"
```

## Configure

Configuration should happen as **early as possible** in your application's lifecycle.



```python {filename:main.py}
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    
    # Adds request headers and IP for users, for more info visit:
    # https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/data-management/data-collected/
    send_default_pii=True,
    
    # ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ logs
    # Enable logs to be sent to Sentry
    enable_logs=True,
    # ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ logs
    
    # ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ performance
    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for tracing.
    # We recommend adjusting this value in production
    # Learn more at
    # https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/configuration/options/#traces-sample-rate
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
    # ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ performance
)
```

## Capture Python Errors

The Sentry SDK automatically captures unhandled exceptions. You can also manually capture errors and add context:

### Automatic Error Capture

```python
# This will be automatically captured by Sentry
division_by_zero = 1 / 0
```

### Manual Error Capture

```python
import sentry_sdk

try:
    risky_operation()
except Exception as e:
    # Capture the exception with additional context
    sentry_sdk.capture_exception(e)
```

<Alert>

Learn more about manually capturing errors in our <PlatformLink to="/usage/">Usage documentation</PlatformLink>.

</Alert>

### Adding User Context

```python
import sentry_sdk

# Set user context for all future events
sentry_sdk.set_user({
    "id": "123",
    "username": "jane.doe",
    "email": "jane.doe@example.com"
})

# Add custom tags
sentry_sdk.set_tag("page_locale", "en-us")

# Add custom context
sentry_sdk.set_context("character", {
    "name": "Mighty Fighter",
    "age": 19,
    "attack_type": "melee"
})
```

## Sending Logs

Now let's add structured logging to capture application insights. Logs are enabled in your configuration above.

Use Python's logging module to capture structured logs with meaningful attributes that help you debug issues and understand user behavior.

```python
from sentry_sdk import logger as sentry_logger

sentry_logger.trace('Starting database connection {database}', database="users")
sentry_logger.debug('Cache miss for user {user_id}', user_id=123)
sentry_logger.info('Updated global cache')
sentry_logger.warning('Rate limit reached for endpoint {endpoint}', endpoint='/api/results/')
sentry_logger.error('Failed to process payment. Order: {order_id}. Amount: {amount}', order_id="or_2342", amount=99.99)
sentry_logger.fatal('Database {database} connection pool exhausted', database="users")


# Log with exception information
try:
    process_payment()
except PaymentError as e:
    sentry_logger.error(
        "Payment failed with exception",
        attributes={"transaction_id": "txn_789"}
    )
```

</OnboardingOption>

## Custom Traces with Attributes

Create custom spans to measure specific operations and add meaningful attributes. This helps you understand performance bottlenecks and debug issues with detailed context.

```python
import sentry_sdk

# Create custom spans to measure specific operations
def process_user_data(user_id):
    with sentry_sdk.start_span(
        op="function",
        description="Process User Data"
    ) as span:
        # Set data attributes after span creation
        span.set_data("user_id", user_id)
        span.set_data("operation", "data_processing")
        span.set_data("version", "2.1")

        # Your business logic here
        user_data = fetch_user_data(user_id)

        # Nested span for specific operations
        with sentry_sdk.start_span(
            op="transform",
            description="Transform Data"
        ) as inner_span:
            # Set nested span data
            inner_span.set_data("record_count", len(user_data))
            inner_span.set_data("transform_type", "normalize")

            result = transform_user_data(user_data)

        return result

  # Add attributes to existing spans
span = sentry_sdk.get_current_span()
if span:
    span.set_data("cache_hit", True)
    span.set_data("region", "us-west-2")
    span.set_data("performance_score", 0.95)
```

</OnboardingOption>

## Verify Your Setup

Let's test your setup and confirm that Sentry is working correctly and sending data to your Sentry project.

### Test Error Capturing

Add the following test code to one of your Python files to trigger an error that Sentry will capture:

```python
def trigger_error():
    # ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ logs
    division_by_zero = 1 / 0
    # ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ logs

# Call this function to test
trigger_error()
```

Run your application and trigger the error to send it to Sentry.

### View Captured Data in Sentry

Now, head over to your project on [Sentry.io](https://sentry.io) to view the collected data (it takes a couple of moments for the data to appear).

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-verify-locate-data" />

## Next Steps

At this point, you should have integrated Sentry into your Python application and should already be sending error and performance data to your Sentry project.

Now's a good time to customize your setup and look into more advanced topics:

- Extend Sentry to your frontend using one of our [JavaScript SDKs](/)
- Continue to <PlatformLink to="/configuration">customize your configuration</PlatformLink>
- Learn about [instrumenting your specific framework](/platforms/python/integrations/)
- Learn how to <PlatformLink to="/usage">manually capture errors</PlatformLink>
- Set up <PlatformLink to="/configuration/releases/">release tracking</PlatformLink>
