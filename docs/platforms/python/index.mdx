## Install

Install the Sentry SDK using [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):

```bash
pip install --upgrade sentry-sdk
```

## Configure

Configuration should happen as early as possible in your application's lifecycle.



```python {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "8-10", "profiling": "11-14"}}
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    # Add request headers and IP for users,
    # see https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/data-management/data-collected/ for more info
    send_default_pii=True,
    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for tracing.
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
    # Set profiles_sample_rate to 1.0 to profile 100%
    # of sampled transactions.
    # We recommend adjusting this value in production.
    profiles_sample_rate=1.0,
)
```

## Verify

Add this intentional error to your application to test that everything is working right away.

```py
division_by_zero = 1 / 0
```
