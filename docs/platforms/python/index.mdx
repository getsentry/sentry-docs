  options={[
    'error-monitoring',
    'performance',
    'profiling',
  ]}
/>

## Install

Install the Sentry SDK using [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):

```bash
pip install --upgrade sentry-sdk
```

## Configure

Configuration should happen as early as possible in your application's lifecycle.



```python {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "5-7", "profiling": "8-11"}}
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for tracing.
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
    # Set profiles_sample_rate to 1.0 to profile 100%
    # of sampled transactions.
    # We recommend adjusting this value in production.
    profiles_sample_rate=1.0,
)
```

## Verify

Add this intentional error to your application to test that everything is working right away.

```py
division_by_zero = 1 / 0
```

<Note>

Learn more about manually capturing an error or message in our <PlatformLink to="/usage/">Usage documentation</PlatformLink>.

</Note>

To view and resolve the recorded error, log into [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and select your project. Clicking on the error's title will open a page where you can see detailed information and mark it as resolved.

<Note>

Not seeing your error in Sentry? Make sure you're running the above example from a file and not from a Python shell like IPython.
