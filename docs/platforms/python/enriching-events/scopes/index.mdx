When an event is captured and sent to Sentry, SDKs will merge that event data with extra
information from the current scope. SDKs will typically automatically manage the scopes
for you in the framework integrations and you don't need to think about them. However,
you should know what a scope is and how you can use it to your advantage.

## What's a Scope

A scope manages an event's data. For instance, the SDK stores [contexts](../context/) and [breadcrumbs](../breadcrumbs/) on the scope.

There are three types of scopes:

- the *global scope*: A single globally-shared scope storing data relevant for the whole app (e.g., the release)
- *isolation scopes*: Thread-local scopes created for each request-response lifecycle to store data relevant to the request
- *current scopes*: Thread-local scopes created for each span to store data relevant to the span

The SDK and the SDK's built-in integrations automatically manage the scopes. For example, web framework integrations create an isolation scope for each request handled. When you call a top-level API function, such as <PlatformIdentifier name="set-tag" />, the SDK determines the correct scope on which to operate.

At the end of the pipeline, the final data applied to the event is the result of merging the global scope and the isolation and current scopes together, applying data from each in turn.

## Changing the Scope

We generally recommend using the top-level API, since the SDK's automatic scope management handles most use cases.

However, if your use case requires direct access to the scope object, you can use the <PlatformIdentifier name="new-scope" /> context manager. <PlatformIdentifier name="new-scope" /> forks the current scope, allows you to modify the new scope while the context manager is active, and restores the original scope afterwards. Using <PlatformIdentifier name="new-scope" /> allows you to send data for only one specific event, for instance when [modifying the context](../context/). It is roughly equivalent to the <PlatformIdentifier name="push-scope" /> context manager in earlier (1.x) versions of the SDK.

<Note>

Avoid calling top-level APIs inside the  <PlatformIdentifier name="new-scope" /> context manager. The top-level API might interact with a different scope from what <PlatformIdentifier name="new-scope" /> yields, causing unintended results. While within the <PlatformIdentifier name="new-scope" /> context manager, please call methods directly on the scope that <PlatformIdentifier name="new-scope" /> yields!

</Note>

Using <PlatformIdentifier name="new-scope" /> you can, for instance, add custom tags or inform Sentry about the currently authenticated user.

<PlatformContent includePath="enriching-events/scopes/configure-scope" />

You can also apply this configuration when unsetting a user at logout:

<PlatformContent includePath="enriching-events/unset-user" />

To learn what useful information can be associated with scopes see
[the context documentation](../context/).
