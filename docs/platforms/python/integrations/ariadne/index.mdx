The Ariadne integration captures errors from the
[Ariadne GraphQL library](https://ariadnegraphql.org/), which can then be viewed
in [Sentry](https://sentry.io).

## Install

To get started, install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI.

```bash
pip install --upgrade sentry-sdk
```

## Configure

If you have the `ariadne` package in your dependencies, the Ariadne integration will be enabled automatically when you initialize the Sentry SDK.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-config" />

## Verify

Create a file called `app.py` with the following contents:

```python
from ariadne import QueryType, gql, make_executable_schema
from ariadne.asgi import GraphQL

sentry_sdk.init(...)  # same as above

type_defs = gql(
    """
    type Query {
        hello: String!
    }
"""
)

query = QueryType()

@query.field("hello")
def resolve_hello(*_):
    1 / 0
    return "Hello!"

schema = make_executable_schema(type_defs, query)
app = GraphQL(schema, debug=True)
```

Make sure you have `uvicorn` installed:

```bash
pip install uvicorn
```

And finally run your GraphQL web server with:

```bash
uvicorn app:app
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) in your browser. You should
see the GraphiQL graphical user interface.

Enter `{ hello }` into the query field then press the "Execute query" button. Your
web app will be queried and will encounter the `ZeroDivisionError` error we've
snuck into the `resolve_hello` resolver function.

This will create a corresponding `GraphQLError` in the Issues section of
[sentry.io](https://sentry.io). It will take a couple of moments for the data to appear in [Sentry](https://sentry.io).

## Options

The Ariadne integration can capture request and response payload for each GraphQL
error that happens. Since these may contain sensitive data, the SDK needs to be
initialized with the
[send_default_pii](/platforms/python/configuration/options/#send-default-pii)
option set to `True`.

By default, no request and response data will be attached.

```python
sentry_sdk.init(
    # same options as above
    send_default_pii=True,
)
```

<Alert level="warning" title="Note">

Since `send_default_pii` is a global SDK option, setting it to `True` will affect all integrations, not just Ariadne. Please make sure to
[scrub sensitive data](/platforms/python/data-management/sensitive-data/)
from events before enabling this option.

</Alert>
