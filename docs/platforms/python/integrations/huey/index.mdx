The huey integration adds support for the
[huey task queue library](https://huey.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Install

To get started, install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI.

```bash
pip install --upgrade sentry-sdk
```

## Configure

The huey integration is enabled automatically if you have the `huey` package installed.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-config" />

## Verify

```python
from huey import SqliteHuey

sentry_sdk.init(...)  # same as above

huey = SqliteHuey(filename='demo.db')

@huey.task()
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

with sentry_sdk.start_transaction(name="testing_huey"):
    result = add(1, 2)
```

Running this will create a new transaction called `testing_huey` in the
Performance section of [sentry.io](https://sentry.io). It may
take a couple of moments for the transaction to show up.

## Supported Versions

- huey: 2.0+
- Python: 3.6+
