The [Unleash](https://www.getunleash.io/) integration tracks feature flag evaluations produced by the Unleash SDK. These evaluations are held in memory and sent to Sentry for review and analysis if an error occurs. **At the moment, we only support boolean flag evaluations.**

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI with the `unleash` extra.

```bash
pip install --upgrade 'sentry-sdk[unleash]'
```

## Configure

Add `UnleashIntegration` to your `integrations` list:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.unleash import UnleashIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    # Add data like request headers and IP for users, if applicable;
    # see https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/data-management/data-collected/ for more info
    send_default_pii=True,
    integrations=[UnleashIntegration()],
)
```

For more information on how to use Unleash, read Unleash's [Python reference](https://docs.getunleash.io/reference/sdks/python) and [quickstart guide](https://docs.getunleash.io/quickstart).

## Verify

Test the integration by evaluating a feature flag using your Unleash SDK before capturing an exception.

```python
import sentry_sdk
from UnleashClient import UnleashClient

unleash = UnleashClient(...)  # See Unleash quickstart.
unleash.initialize_client()

test_flag_enabled = unleash.is_enabled("test-flag")
sentry_sdk.capture_exception(Exception("Something went wrong!"))
```

Visit the [Sentry website](https://sentry.io/issues/) and confirm that your error
event has recorded the feature flag "test-flag", and its value is equal to `test_flag_enabled`.

## Supported Versions

- UnleashClient >= 6.0.1
- sentry-sdk >= 2.20.0
- python >= 3.8
