The `AsyncPGIntegration` captures queries from
[asyncpg](https://github.com/MagicStack/asyncpg), which can be viewed in Sentry's **Performance** page.

## Install

To get started, install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI.

```bash
pip install --upgrade sentry-sdk[asyncpg]
```

## Configure

If you have the `asyncpg` package in your dependencies, the asyncpg integration will be enabled automatically when you initialize the Sentry SDK.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-config" />

## Verify

```python
import asyncpg

async def main():
    sentry_sdk.init(...)  # same as above

    with sentry_sdk.start_transaction(name="testing_sentry"):
        conn = await asyncpg.connect(DATABASE_URL)
        await conn.fetch("SELECT * FROM pg_catalog.pg_tables;")
        await conn.close()

asyncio.run(main())
```

This will create a transaction called `testing_sentry` in the Performance section of [sentry.io](https://sentry.io), and create spans for the `connect` and the `SELECT` operations.

It takes a couple of moments for the data to appear in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

## Supported Versions

- asyncpg: 0.23+
