<Alert title="Beta">

The support for **LangChain** is in its beta phase.

We are working on supporting different AI libraries (see [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/discussions/3007)).

If you want to try the beta features and are willing to give feedback, please let us know on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Ww9hbqr).

</Alert>

This integration connects Sentry with [Langchain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain).
The integration has been confirmed to work with Langchain 0.1.11.

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI and the appropriate langchain packages:

```bash
pip install --upgrade 'sentry-sdk' 'langchain-openai' 'langchain-core'
```

## Configure

If you have the `langchain` package in your dependencies, the Langchain integration will be enabled automatically when you initialize the Sentry SDK.

An additional dependency, `tiktoken`, is required to be installed if you want to calculate token usage for streaming chat responses.


In addition to capturing errors, you can monitor interactions between multiple services or applications by [enabling tracing](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/). You can also collect and analyze performance profiles from real users with [profiling](/product/explore/profiling/).

Select which Sentry features you'd like to install in addition to Error Monitoring to get the corresponding installation and configuration instructions below.

<OnboardingOptionButtons
  options={[
    'error-monitoring',
    'performance',
    'profiling',
  ]}
/>

```python {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "9-11", "profiling": "12-15"}}
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    # Send personally-identifiable information like LLM responses to Sentry;
    # see https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/data-management/data-collected/ for more info
    send_default_pii=True,
    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for performance monitoring.
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
    # Set profiles_sample_rate to 1.0 to profile 100%
    # of sampled transactions.
    # We recommend adjusting this value in production.
    profiles_sample_rate=1.0,
)
```

## Verify

Verify that the integration works by inducing an error:

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(...)  # same as above

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo-0125", temperature=0, api_key="bad API key")
with sentry_sdk.start_transaction(op="ai-inference", name="The result of the AI inference"):
    response = llm.invoke([("system", "What is the capital of paris?")])
    print(response)
```

After running this script, a transaction will be created in the Performance section of [sentry.io](https://sentry.io). Additionally, an error event (about the bad API key) will be sent to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and will be connected to the transaction.

It may take a couple of moments for the data to appear in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

## Behavior

- The Langchain integration will connect Sentry with Langchain and automatically monitor all LLM, tool, and function calls.

- All exceptions in the execution of the chain are reported.

- Sentry considers LLM and tokenizer inputs/outputs as PII and, by default, does not include PII data. If you want to include the data, set `send_default_pii=True` in the `sentry_sdk.init()` call. To explicitly exclude prompts and outputs despite `send_default_pii=True`, configure the integration with `include_prompts=False` as shown in the [Options section](#options) below.

## Options

By adding `LangchainIntegration` to your `sentry_sdk.init()` call explicitly, you can set options for `LangchainIntegration` to change its behavior:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.langchain import LangchainIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    # ...
    integrations=[
        LangchainIntegration(
            include_prompts=False,  # LLM/tokenizer inputs/outputs will be not sent to Sentry, despite send_default_pii=True
            max_spans=500,
            tiktoken_encoding_name="cl100k_base",
        ),
    ],
)
```

You can pass the following keyword arguments to `LangchainIntegration()`:

- `include_prompts`:

  Whether LLM and tokenizer inputs and outputs should be sent to Sentry. Sentry considers this data personal identifiable data (PII) by default. If you want to include the data, set `send_default_pii=True` in the `sentry_sdk.init()` call. To explicitly exclude prompts and outputs despite `send_default_pii=True`, configure the integration with `include_prompts=False`.

  The default is `True`.

- `max_spans`:

  The most number of spans (e.g., LLM calls) that can be processed at the same time.

  The default is `1024`.

- `tiktoken_encoding_name`:

  If you want to calculate token usage for streaming chat responses you need to have an additional dependency, [tiktoken](https://pypi.org/project/tiktoken/) installed and specify the `tiktoken_encoding_name` that you use for tokenization. See the [OpenAI Cookbook](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_count_tokens_with_tiktoken) for possible values.

  The default is `None`.
