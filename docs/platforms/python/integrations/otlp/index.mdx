The OTLP integration configures the Sentry SDK to automatically send trace data instrumented by an OpenTelemetry SDK to Sentry's [OpenTelemetry Protocol](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/protocol/) [ingestion endpoint](/concepts/otlp).

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI with the `opentelemetry-otlp` extra.

```bash {tabTitle:pip}
pip install "sentry-sdk[opentelemetry-otlp]"
```
```bash {tabTitle:uv}
uv add "sentry-sdk[opentelemetry-otlp]"
```

## Configure

You need to configure both the OpenTelemetry and Sentry SDKs to get trace data.

### OpenTelemetry

For the OpenTelemetry SDK, you need to [configure instrumentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/python/getting-started/#instrumentation) you want to capture.

### Sentry

For the Sentry SDK, you simply need to enable our `OTLPIntegration` along with your existing configuration.

<OnboardingOptionButtons
  options={["error-monitoring", "logs"]}

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.otlp import OTLPIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    # Add data like request headers and IP for users, if applicable;
    # see https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/data-management/data-collected/ for more info
    send_default_pii=True,
    # ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ logs
    # Enable logs to be sent to Sentry
    enable_logs=True,
    # ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ logs
    integrations=[
        OTLPIntegration(),
    ],
)
```

## Behavior

Under the hood, the `OTLPIntegration` will setup the following parts:

* A [`SpanExporter`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/components/#exporters) that will automatically setup the OTLP ingestion endpoint from your Sentry DSN. This enables tracing in Sentry. **Note:** _Do not_ also set up tracing via the Python SDK.
* A [`Propagator`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/context-propagation/#propagation) that ensures [distributed tracing](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/distributed-tracing/) works
* Trace/Span linking for all other Sentry events such as Errors, Logs, Crons and Metrics

## Options

You can pass the following keyword arguments to `OTLPIntegration()`:


- `setup_otlp_traces_exporter`:

  Automatically configure an Exporter to send OTLP traces to the right project from the DSN, defaults to `True`.

  Set to `False` if using a custom collector or to setup the TracerProvider manually.

- `setup_propagator`:

  Automatically configure the Sentry Propagator for Distributed Tracing, defaults to `True`.

  Set to `False` to configure propagators manually or to disable propagation.

- `capture_exceptions`:

   Set to `True` to intercept and capture exceptions on the OpenTelemetry Span recorded with `Span.record_exception` in Sentry as well, defaults to `False`.

   Caveat: Since Sentry already captures most exceptions, duplicate exceptions might be dropped by [`DedupeIntegration`](/platforms/python/integrations/default-integrations/#deduplication) but that should not affect your overall product experience on the [Issues](/product/issues) page.
