The OTLP integration configures the Sentry SDK to automatically send trace data instrumented by an OpenTelemetry SDK to Sentry's [OpenTelemetry Protocol](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/protocol/) [ingestion endpoint](/concepts/otlp).

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI with the `opentelemetry-otlp` extra.

```bash {tabTitle:pip}
pip install "sentry-sdk[opentelemetry-otlp]"
```
```bash {tabTitle:uv}
uv add "sentry-sdk[opentelemetry-otlp]"
```

## Configure

You need to configure both the OpenTelemetry and Sentry SDKs to get trace data.

### OpenTelemetry

For the OpenTelemetry SDK, you need to [configure instrumentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/python/getting-started/#instrumentation) you want to capture.

### Sentry

For the Sentry SDK, you simply need to enable our `OTLPIntegration` along with your existing configuration.

  options={["error-monitoring", "logs"]}

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.otlp import OTLPIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    # Add data like request headers and IP for users, if applicable;
    # see https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/data-management/data-collected/ for more info
    send_default_pii=True,
    # ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ logs
    # Enable logs to be sent to Sentry
    enable_logs=True,
    # ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ logs
    integrations=[
        OTLPIntegration(),
    ],
)
```

## Behavior

Under the hood, the `OTLPIntegration` will setup the following parts:

* A [`SpanExporter`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/components/#exporters) that will automatically setup the OTLP ingestion endpoint from your Sentry DSN. This enables tracing in Sentry. **Note:** _Do not_ also set up tracing via the Python SDK. 
* A [`Propagator`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/context-propagation/#propagation) that ensures [distributed tracing](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/distributed-tracing/) works
* Trace/Span linking for all other Sentry events such as Errors, Logs, Crons and Metrics
