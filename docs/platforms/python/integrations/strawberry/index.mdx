The Strawberry integration captures errors and operations from the
[Strawberry GraphQL library](https://strawberry.rocks/), which can then be viewed
in [Sentry](https://sentry.io).

## Install

To get started, install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI.

```bash
pip install --upgrade sentry-sdk
```

## Configure

Add `StrawberryIntegration()` to your `integrations` list:

<SignInNote />

<OnboardingOptionButtons
  options={[
    'error-monitoring',
    'performance',
    'profiling',
  ]}
/>

```python {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "6-8", "profiling": "9-12"}}
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.strawberry import StrawberryIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for performance monitoring.
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
    # Set profiles_sample_rate to 1.0 to profile 100%
    # of sampled transactions.
    # We recommend adjusting this value in production.
    profiles_sample_rate=1.0,
    integrations=[
        StrawberryIntegration(
            # Set async_execution to True if you have
            # at least one async resolver
            async_execution=True,
        ),
    ],
)
```

## Verify

Make sure you have all the prerequisites installed:

```bash
pip install 'strawberry-graphql[debug-server]'
pip install fastapi
```

Create a `schema.py` file with the below content:

```python
import strawberry

sentry_sdk.init(...)  # same as above

async def resolve_hello(root) -> str:
    1 / 0
    return "Hello world!"

@strawberry.type
class Query:
    hello: str = strawberry.field(resolver=resolve_hello)

schema = strawberry.Schema(Query)
```

To start the web server, run:

```bash
strawberry server schema
```

Navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/graphql](http://127.0.0.1:8000/graphql) in your
browser. You should see the GraphiQL graphical interface.

Type `query HelloQuery { hello }` into the query input field then press the
"Execute query" button. Your web server will be queried, which should result in an
exception due to the `ZeroDivisionError` we've snuck into the `resolve_hello`
resolver.

This will create a `GraphQLError` in the Issues section as well as a transaction
in the Performance section of [sentry.io](https://sentry.io). It will take a couple of moments for the data to appear in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

## Options

There are several options you will get to choose from:

### Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Execution

Strawberry supports both synchronous and asynchronous execution of GraphQL
queries. If you have at least one async resolver, you should initialize
`StrawberryIntegration` with `async_execution=True`, otherwise set it to `False`.

The SDK will make a best-effort guess if `async_execution` is not provided,
based on installed web frameworks.

```python
sentry_sdk.init(
    # ...
    integrations=[
        StrawberryIntegration(
            async_execution=True  # or False
        ),
    ],
)
```

### Capturing Request and Response Bodies

The Strawberry integration can capture request and response bodies
for each GraphQL error that happens. Since these may contain sensitive data,
this is the default behavior. To enable capturing request and response bodies, the
SDK needs to be initialized with the
[send_default_pii](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/configuration/options/#send-default-pii) option set to `True`.

```python
sentry_sdk.init(
    # ...
    send_default_pii=True,
)
```

<Alert level="warning" title="Note">

Since `send_default_pii` is a global SDK option, setting it to `True` will affect all
integrations, not just Strawberry. Please make sure to
[remove sensitive data](/platforms/python/data-management/sensitive-data/)
from events before enabling this option.

</Alert>

## Notes

Strawberry comes with a (now deprecated) built-in
[Sentry tracing extension](https://strawberry.rocks/docs/extensions/sentry-tracing)
that this integration is built on. To prevent duplicate traces, the Sentry SDK integration will deactivate the built-in Strawberry extension if you happen to be using both.
