The Feature Flags integration allows you to manually track feature flag evaluations through an API. These evaluations are held in memory, and in the event an error occurs, sent to Sentry for review and analysis.
**At the moment, we only support boolean flag evaluations.**

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI.

```bash
pip install --upgrade 'sentry-sdk'
```

## Configure

Add `FeatureFlagsIntegration()` to your `integrations` list:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.featureflags import FeatureFlagsIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    integrations=[
        FeatureFlagsIntegration(),
    ],
)
```

## Verify

The integration is tested by calling the `add_feature_flag` API before capturing an exception.

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.featureflags import add_feature_flag

add_feature_flag('test-flag', False)

sentry_sdk.capture_exception(Exception("Something went wrong!"))
```

Go to your Sentry project and confirm that your error event has recorded the feature flag "test-flag" and its value "false".
