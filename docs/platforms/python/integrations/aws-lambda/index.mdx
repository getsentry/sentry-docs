You can instrument your AWS Lambda functions in several different ways:

- **Without touching your code.**
    This is configurable from within the Sentry product. This way is probably the easiest for admin kind of people that have access to the AWS infrastructure. See the [AWS Lambda Cloud Monitoring Product Guide](/product/integrations/cloud-monitoring/aws-lambda/).
- **By adding the Sentry Lambda Layer manually to your function.**
    A quick way to add Sentry to your AWS Lambda function. Gets you started quickly but gives you limited configuration possibilities with environment vars. See <PlatformLink to="/integrations/aws-lambda/manual-layer/">AWS Lambda Layer</PlatformLink>.
- **By manually adding Sentry in your function code.**
    You need to install the Sentry SDK into your AWS Lambda function packages. This is most work to set up, but it gives you full control of your Sentry setup and manual instrumentation. See <PlatformLink to="/integrations/aws-lambda/manual-instrumentation/">AWS Lambda Manual Instrumentation</PlatformLink>.
