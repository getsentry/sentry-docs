You can instrument your AWS Lambda functions in several different ways:

- **Without touching your code.** This is configurable from within the Sentry product. See the [AWS Lambda Cloud Monitoring Product Guide](/product/integrations/cloud-monitoring/aws-lambda/).
- **By adding the Sentry Lambda Layer manually to your function.** See <PlatformLink to="/integrations/aws-lambda/manual-layer/">AWS Lambda Layer</PlatformLink>.
- **By manually adding Sentry in your function code.** See <PlatformLink to="/integrations/aws-lambda/manual-instrumentation/">AWS Lambda Manual Instrumentation</PlatformLink>.
- **By adding Sentry to your AWS Lambda container image.** See <PlatformLink to="/integrations/aws-lambda/container-image/">AWS Lambda Container Image</PlatformLink>.
