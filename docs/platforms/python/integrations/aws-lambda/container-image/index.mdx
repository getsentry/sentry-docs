<Alert level="warning" title="Deprecation Notice">

The Python AWS Lambda Container Image is deprecated.

Instead, please use one of these ways:

- **Without touching your code.**
    This is configurable from within the Sentry product. This way is probably the easiest for admin kind of people that have access to the AWS infrastructure. See the [AWS Lambda Cloud Monitoring Product Guide](/product/integrations/cloud-monitoring/aws-lambda/).
- **By adding the Sentry Lambda Layer manually to your function.**
    A quick way to add Sentry to your AWS Lambda function. Gets you started quickly but gives you limited configuration possibilities with environment vars. See <PlatformLink to="/integrations/aws-lambda/manual-layer/">AWS Lambda Layer</PlatformLink>.
- **By manually adding Sentry in your function code.**
    You need to install the Sentry SDK into your AWS Lambda function packages. This is most work to set up, but it gives you full control of your Sentry setup and manual instrumentation. See <PlatformLink to="/integrations/aws-lambda/manual-instrumentation/">AWS Lambda Manual Instrumentation</PlatformLink>.

</Alert>

As an alternative setup method, you can add Sentry to your [Container Image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/images-create.html). To import Sentry's Layer Image, add the following to your Dockerfile:

```docker {tabTitle: Dockerfile}
COPY --from=public.ecr.aws/sentry/sentry-python-serverless-sdk:<VERSION> /opt/ /opt
```

Replace `VERSION` with a specific version number (for example, 6). You can see a complete list of available versions in Sentry's [Amazon ECR repository](https://gallery.ecr.aws/sentry/sentry-python-serverless-sdk).

## Function Configuration

Set your imageâ€™s CMD value to the Sentry Handler:

```docker {tabTitle: Dockerfile}
CMD ["sentry_sdk.integrations.init_serverless_sdk.sentry_lambda_handler"]
```

Next, set the following environment variables in AWS:

- Set `SENTRY_INITIAL_HANDLER` to the path of your function handler
- Set `SENTRY_DSN` to your Sentry DSN
- Set `SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE` to your preferred [sampling rate](/platforms/python/configuration/sampling/#sampling-transaction-events) for transactions

Alternatively, you can also set the environment variables in your Dockerfile. Values set in AWS override the values in a Dockerfile if both are provided.

<SignInNote />

```docker {tabTitle: Dockerfile}
ENV SENTRY_INITIAL_HANDLER="<PATH_TO_FUNCTION_HANDLER>"
ENV SENTRY_DSN="___PUBLIC_DSN___"
ENV SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE="1.0"
```
