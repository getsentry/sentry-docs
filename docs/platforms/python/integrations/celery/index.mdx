The Celery integration adds support for the [Celery Task Queue System](https://docs.celeryq.dev/).

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI with the `celery` extra:

```bash
pip install --upgrade 'sentry-sdk[celery]'
```

## Configure

If you have the `celery` package in your dependencies, the Celery integration will be enabled automatically when you initialize the Sentry SDK.

<Alert>
  Make sure that the call to `sentry_sdk.init()` is loaded on worker startup and
  not only in the module where your tasks are defined. Otherwise, the
  initialization may happen too late and events might not get reported.
</Alert>

### Set up Celery Without Django

When using Celery without Django, you'll need to initialize the Sentry SDK in both your application and the Celery worker processes spawned by the Celery daemon.

In addition to capturing errors, you can use Sentry for [distributed tracing](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/) and [profiling](/product/explore/profiling/). Select what you'd like to install to get the corresponding installation and configuration instructions below.

#### Set up Sentry in Celery Daemon or Worker Processes

<OnboardingOptionButtons
  options={["error-monitoring", "performance", "profiling"]}
/>

```python {filename:tasks.py} {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "12-14", "profiling": "15-18"}}
from celery import Celery, signals
import sentry_sdk

# Initializing Celery
app = Celery("tasks", broker="...")

# Initialize Sentry SDK on Celery startup
@signals.celeryd_init.connect
def init_sentry(**_kwargs):
    sentry_sdk.init(
        dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
        # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
        # of transactions for tracing.
        traces_sample_rate=1.0,
        # Set profiles_sample_rate to 1.0 to profile 100%
        # of sampled transactions.
        # We recommend adjusting this value in production.
        profiles_sample_rate=1.0,
    )

# Task definitions go here
@app.task
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
```

The [`celeryd_init`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/signals.html?#celeryd-init) signal is triggered when the Celery daemon starts, before the worker processes are spawned. If you need to initialize Sentry for each individual worker process, us the [`worker_init`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/signals.html?#worker-init) signal instead.

#### Set up Sentry in Your Application

<OnboardingOptionButtons
  options={["error-monitoring", "performance", "profiling"]}
/>

```python {filename:main.py} {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "8-10", "profiling": "11-14"}}
from tasks import add
import sentry_sdk

def main():
    # Initializing Sentry SDK in our process
    sentry_sdk.init(
        dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
        # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
        # of transactions for tracing.
        traces_sample_rate=1.0,
        # Set profiles_sample_rate to 1.0 to profile 100%
        # of sampled transactions.
        # We recommend adjusting this value in production.
        profiles_sample_rate=1.0,
    )

    # Enqueueing a task to be processed by Celery
    with sentry_sdk.start_transaction(name="calling-a-celery-task"):
        result = add.delay(4, 4)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Set up Celery With Django

If you're using Celery with Django in a typical setup, have initialized the SDK in your `settings.py` file (as described in the [Django integration documentation](/platforms/python/integrations/django/#configure)), and have your Celery configured to use the same settings as [`config_from_object`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/django/first-steps-with-django.html), there's no need to initialize the Celery SDK separately.

## Verify

To confirm that your SDK is initialized on worker start, pass `debug=True` to `sentry_sdk.init()`. This will add extra output to your Celery logs when the SDK is initialized. If you see the output during worker startup, and not just after a task has started, then it's working correctly.

The snippet below includes an intentional `ZeroDivisionError` in the Celery task that will be captured by Sentry. To trigger the error call `debug_sentry.delay()`:

```python {filename:tasks.py} {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "12-14", "profiling": "15-18"}}
from celery import Celery, signals
import sentry_sdk

app = Celery("tasks", broker="...")

@signals.celeryd_init.connect
def init_sentry(**_kwargs):
    sentry_sdk.init(...)  # same as above

@app.task
def debug_sentry():
    1/0
```

<Alert level="info" title="Note on distributed tracing">

Sentry uses custom message headers for distributed tracing. For Celery versions 4.x, with [message protocol of version 1](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/internals/protocol.html#version-1), this functionality is broken, and Celery fails to propagate custom headers to the worker. Protocol version 2, which is the default since Celery version 4.0, is not affected.

The fix for the custom headers propagation issue was introduced to Celery project ([PR](https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/6374)) starting with version 5.0.1. However, the fix was not backported to versions 4.x.

</Alert>

## Options

To set options on `CeleryIntegration` to change its behavior, add it explicitly to your `sentry_sdk.init()`:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.celery import CeleryIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    # same as above
    integrations=[
        CeleryIntegration(
            monitor_beat_tasks=True,
            exclude_beat_tasks=[
                "unimportant-task",
                "payment-check-.*"
            ],
        ),
    ],
)
```

You can pass the following keyword arguments to `CeleryIntegration()`:

- `propagate_traces`

  Propagate Sentry tracing information to the Celery task. This makes it possible to link Celery task errors to the function that triggered the task.

  If this is set to `False`:

  - errors in Celery tasks won't be matched to the triggering function.
  - your Celery tasks will start a new trace and won't be connected to the trace in the calling function.

  The default is `True`.

  See [Distributed Traces](#distributed-traces) below to learn how to get more fine grained control over distributed tracing in Celery tasks.

- `monitor_beat_tasks`:

  Turn auto-instrumentation on or off for Celery Beat tasks using Sentry Crons.

  See <PlatformLink to="/crons/#celery-beat-auto-discovery">Celery Beat Auto Discovery</PlatformLink> to learn more.

  The default is `False`.

- `exclude_beat_tasks`:

  A list of Celery Beat tasks that should be excluded from auto-instrumentation using Sentry Crons. Only applied if `monitor_beat_tasks` is set to `True`.

  The list can contain strings with the names of tasks in the Celery Beat schedule to be excluded. It can also include regular expressions to match multiple tasks. For example, if you include `"payment-check-.*"` every task starting with `payment-check-` will be excluded from auto-instrumentation.

  See <PlatformLink to="/crons/#celery-beat-auto-discovery">Celery Beat Auto Discovery</PlatformLink> to learn more.

  The default is `None`.

## Distributed Traces

Distributed tracing extends the trace from the code that's running your Celery task so that it includes the code that initiated the task.

You can disable this globally with the `propagate_traces` parameter, documented above. If you set `propagate_traces` to `False`, all Celery tasks will start their own trace.

If you want to have more fine-grained control over trace distribution, you can override the `propagate_traces` option by passing the `sentry-propagate-traces` header when starting the Celery task:

**Note:** The `CeleryIntegration` does not utilize the `traces_sample_rate` config option for deciding if a trace should be propagated into a Celery task.

```python
import sentry_sdk

# Enable global distributed traces (this is the default, just to be explicit)
sentry_sdk.init(
    # same as above
    integrations=[
        CeleryIntegration(
            propagate_traces=True
        ),
    ],
)

# This will propagate the trace:
my_task_a.delay("some parameter")

# This will propagate the trace:
my_task_b.apply_async(
    args=("some_parameter", )
)

# This will NOT propagate the trace. The task will start its own trace:
my_task_b.apply_async(
    args=("some_parameter", ),
    headers={"sentry-propagate-traces": False},
)

# Note: overriding the tracing behaviour using `task_x.delay()` is not possible.
```
