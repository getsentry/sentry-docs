The Celery integration adds support for the [Celery Task Queue System](https://docs.celeryq.dev/).

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI with the `celery` extra:

```bash
pip install --upgrade 'sentry-sdk[celery]'
```

## Configure

If you have the `celery` package in your dependencies, the Celery integration will be enabled automatically when you initialize the Sentry SDK.

Make sure that the **call to `init` is loaded on worker startup**, and not only in the module where your tasks are defined. Otherwise, the initialization happens too late and events might end up not being reported.

### Standalone Setup

If you're using Celery standalone, there are two ways to set this up:

- Initializing the SDK in the configuration file loaded with Celery's `--config` parameter
- Initializing the SDK by hooking it to either the [`celeryd_init`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/signals.html?#celeryd-init) or [`worker_init`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/signals.html?#worker-init) signals

  ```python
  import sentry_sdk
  from celery import Celery, signals

  app = Celery("myapp")

  #@signals.worker_init.connect
  @signals.celeryd_init.connect
  def init_sentry(**_kwargs):
      sentry_sdk.init(...)  # same as above
  ```

### Setup With Django

If you're using Celery with Django in a conventional setup, have already initialized the SDK in [your `settings.py` file](/platforms/python/integrations/django/#configure), and have Celery using the same settings with [`config_from_object`](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/django/first-steps-with-django.html), you don't need to initialize the SDK separately for Celery.

## Verify

To verify if your SDK is initialized on worker start, you can pass `debug=True` to `sentry_sdk.init()` to see extra output when the SDK is initialized. If the output appears during worker startup and not only after a task has started, then it's working properly.

<Alert level="info" title="Note on distributed tracing">

Sentry uses custom message headers for distributed tracing. For Celery versions 4.x, with [message protocol of version 1](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/internals/protocol.html#version-1), this functionality is broken, and Celery fails to propagate custom headers to the worker. Protocol version 2, which is the default since Celery version 4.0, is not affected.

The fix for the custom headers propagation issue was introduced to Celery project ([PR](https://github.com/celery/celery/pull/6374)) starting with version 5.0.1. However, the fix was not backported to versions 4.x.

</Alert>

## Options

To set options on `CeleryIntegration` to change its behavior, add it explicitly to your `sentry_sdk.init()`:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.celery import CeleryIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    # same as above
    integrations=[
        CeleryIntegration(
            monitor_beat_tasks=True,
            exclude_beat_tasks=[
                "unimportant-task",
                "payment-check-.*"
            ],
        ),
    ],
)
```

You can pass the following keyword arguments to `CeleryIntegration()`:

- `propagate_traces`

  Propagate Sentry tracing information to the Celery task. This makes it possible to link Celery task errors to the function that triggered the task.

  If this is set to `False`:

  - errors in Celery tasks won't be matched to the triggering function.
  - your Celery tasks will start a new trace and won't be connected to the trace in the calling function.

  The default is `True`.

  See [Distributed Traces](#distributed-traces) below to learn how to get more fine grained control over distributed tracing in Celery tasks.

- `monitor_beat_tasks`:

  Turn auto-instrumentation on or off for Celery Beat tasks using Sentry Crons.

  See <PlatformLink to="/crons/#celery-beat-auto-discovery">Celery Beat Auto Discovery</PlatformLink> to learn more.

  The default is `False`.

- `exclude_beat_tasks`:

  A list of Celery Beat tasks that should be excluded from auto-instrumentation using Sentry Crons. Only applied if `monitor_beat_tasks` is set to `True`.

  The list can contain strings with the names of tasks in the Celery Beat schedule to be excluded. It can also include regular expressions to match multiple tasks. For example, if you include `"payment-check-.*"` every task starting with `payment-check-` will be excluded from auto-instrumentation.

  See <PlatformLink to="/crons/#celery-beat-auto-discovery">Celery Beat Auto Discovery</PlatformLink> to learn more.

  The default is `None`.

## Distributed Traces

Distributed tracing extends the trace from the code that's running your Celery task so that it includes the code that initiated the task.

You can disable this globally with the `propagate_traces` parameter, documented above. If you set `propagate_traces` to `False`, all Celery tasks will start their own trace.

If you want to have more fine-grained control over trace distribution, you can override the `propagate_traces` option by passing the `sentry-propagate-traces` header when starting the Celery task:

**Note:** The `CeleryIntegration` does not utilize the `traces_sample_rate` config option for deciding if a trace should be propagated into a Celery task.

```python
import sentry_sdk

# Enable global distributed traces (this is the default, just to be explicit)
sentry_sdk.init(
    # same as above
    integrations=[
        CeleryIntegration(
            propagate_traces=True
        ),
    ],
)

# This will propagate the trace:
my_task_a.delay("some parameter")

# This will propagate the trace:
my_task_b.apply_async(
    args=("some_parameter", )
)

# This will NOT propagate the trace. The task will start its own trace:
my_task_b.apply_async(
    args=("some_parameter", ),
    headers={"sentry-propagate-traces": False},
)

# Note: overriding the tracing behaviour using `task_x.delay()` is not possible.
```
