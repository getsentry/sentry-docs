The [OpenFeature](https://openfeature.dev/) integration tracks feature flag evaluations produced by the OpenFeature SDK. These evaluations are held in memory and, in the event an error occurs, sent to Sentry for review and analysis.

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI.

```bash
pip install --upgrade 'sentry-sdk'
```

## Configure

Add `OpenFeatureIntegration()` to your `integrations` list:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.OpenFeature import OpenFeatureIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    integrations=[
        OpenFeatureIntegration(),
    ],
)
```

## Verify

The integration is tested by evaluating a feature flag using your OpenFeature SDK before capturing an exception.

```python
from openfeature import api
import sentry_sdk

client = api.get_client()
client.get_boolean_value("hello", default_value=False)
    
sentry_sdk.capture_exception(Exception("Something went wrong!"))
```

Visit the Sentry website and confirm that your error event has recorded the feature flag "hello" and its value "false".
