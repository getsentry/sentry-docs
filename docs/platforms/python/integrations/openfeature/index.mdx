The [OpenFeature](https://openfeature.dev/) integration tracks feature flag evaluations produced by the OpenFeature SDK. This SDK is supported by a broad range of feature flagging providers. For the full list, visit [OpenFeature's ecosystem page](https://openfeature.dev/ecosystem?instant_search%5BrefinementList%5D%5Btype%5D%5B0%5D=Provider&instant_search%5BrefinementList%5D%5BallTechnologies%5D%5B0%5D=Python).

The flag evaluations are held in memory and are sent to Sentry on error and transaction events. **At the moment, we only support boolean flag evaluations.**

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI with the `openfeature` extra.

```bash {tabTitle:pip}
pip install "sentry-sdk[openfeature]"
```
```bash {tabTitle:uv}
uv add "sentry-sdk[openfeature]"
```

## Configure

Add `OpenFeatureIntegration()` to your `integrations` list:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.openfeature import OpenFeatureIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    # Add data like request headers and IP for users, if applicable;
    # see https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/data-management/data-collected/ for more info
    send_default_pii=True,
    integrations=[
        OpenFeatureIntegration(),
    ],
)
```

## Verify

The integration is tested by evaluating a feature flag using your OpenFeature SDK before capturing an exception.

```python
from openfeature import api
import sentry_sdk

client = api.get_client()
client.get_boolean_value("hello", default_value=False)

sentry_sdk.capture_exception(Exception("Something went wrong!"))
```

Visit the Sentry website and confirm that your error event has recorded the feature flag "hello" and its value "false".
