The arq integration adds support for the [arq job queue system](https://arq-docs.helpmanual.io/).

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI with the `arq` extra.

```bash
pip install --upgrade "sentry-sdk[arq]"
```

## Configure

If you have the `arq` package in your dependencies, the arq integration will be enabled automatically when you initialize the Sentry SDK.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-config" />

## Verify

### Enqueing the jobs in `run.py`:

```python
import asyncio

from arq import create_pool
from arq.connections import RedisSettings

async def main():
    sentry_sdk.init(...)  # same as above
    redis = await create_pool(RedisSettings())

    with sentry_sdk.start_transaction(name="testing_sentry"):
        r = await redis.enqueue_job("add_numbers", 1, 2)

asyncio.run(main())
```

When you run `run.py` it will create a transaction called `testing_sentry` in the Performance section of [sentry.io](https://sentry.io), and create a span for enqueing the job.

It takes a couple of moments for the data to appear in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

### Job definition in `demo.py`:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.arq import ArqIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(...)  # same as above

async def add_numbers(ctx, a, b):
    1/0 # raises an error!
    return a + b

class WorkerSettings:
    functions = [add_numbers]
```

When you run a worker with `arq demo.WorkerSettings` it will create a transaction called `add_numbers` in the Performance section of [sentry.io](https://sentry.io), and will also create and issue in Sentry and connect it to the transaction.

It takes a couple of moments for the data to appear in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).
