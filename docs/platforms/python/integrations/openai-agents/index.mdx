<Alert title="Beta">

The support for **OpenAI Agents SDK** is in its beta phase. Please test locally before using in production.

</Alert>

This integration connects Sentry with the [OpenAI Python SDK](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/).
The integration has been confirmed to work with OpenAI Agents version 0.0.19.

Once you've installed this SDK, you can use [Sentry AI Agents Insights](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/insights/agents/), a Sentry dashboard that helps you understand what's going on with your AI agents.

Sentry AI Agents monitoring will automatically collect information about agents, tools, prompts, tokens, and models.

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI:

```bash {tabTitle:pip}
pip install "sentry-sdk"
```

```bash {tabTitle:uv}
uv add "sentry-sdk"
```

## Configure

Add `OpenAIAgentsIntegration()` to your `integrations` list:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.openai_agents import OpenAIAgentsIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    # Add data like inputs and responses to/from LLMs and tools;
    # see https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/data-management/data-collected/ for more info
    send_default_pii=True,
    integrations=[
        OpenAIAgentsIntegration(),
    ],
)
```

## Verify

Verify that the integration works by running an AI agent. The resulting data should show up in your AI Agents Insights dashboard.

```python
import asyncio
import random

import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.openai_agents import OpenAIAgentsIntegration

import agents
from pydantic import BaseModel  # installed by openai-agents

@agents.function_tool
def random_number(max: int) -> int:
    return random.randint(0, max)

class FinalResult(BaseModel):
    number: int

random_number_agent = agents.Agent(
    name="Random Number Agent",
    instructions="Generate a random number.",
    tools=[random_number, ],
    output_type=FinalResult,
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
)

async def main() -> None:
    sentry_sdk.init(
        dsn="...",  # same as above
        # Add data like LLM and tool inputs/outputs;
        # see https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/data-management/data-collected/ for more info
        send_default_pii=True,
        integrations=[
            OpenAIAgentsIntegration(),
        ],
    )

    await agents.Runner.run(
        random_number_agent,
        input=f"Generate a random number between 0 and {10}.",
    )

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

It may take a couple of moments for the data to appear in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

## Behavior

Data on the following will be collected:

- AI agents invocations
- execution of tools
- number of input and output tokens used
- LLM models usage

Sentry considers LLM and tool inputs/outputs as PII and doesn't include PII data by default. If you want to include the data, set `send_default_pii=True` in the `sentry_sdk.init()` call.

## Supported Versions

- OpenAI Agents SDK: 0.0.19+
- Python: 3.9+
