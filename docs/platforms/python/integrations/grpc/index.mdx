description: "Learn about the gRPC integration and how it adds support for the grpcio grpc client and server."
---

The [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) integration instruments incoming unary-unary grpc requests and outgoing unary-unary, unary-stream grpc requests using grpcio channels.

Use this integration to start or continue transactions for incoming grpc requests, create spans for outgoing requests,
and ensure traces are properly propagated to downstream services.

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI with the `grpcio` extra.

```bash
pip install --upgrade 'sentry-sdk[grpcio]'
```

## Configure

Add `GRPCIntegration()` to your `integrations` list, and enable tracing.

This will add appropriate intercepters to your server/client to capture errors and performance data.


In addition to capturing errors, you can monitor interactions between multiple services or applications by [enabling tracing](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/). You can also collect and analyze performance profiles from real users with [profiling](/product/explore/profiling/).

Select which Sentry features you'd like to install in addition to Error Monitoring to get the corresponding installation and configuration instructions below.

### Server

```python {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "8-10", "profiling": "11-14"}}
import grpc

import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.grpc import GRPCIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for tracing.
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
    # Set profiles_sample_rate to 1.0 to profile 100%
    # of sampled transactions.
    # We recommend adjusting this value in production.
    profiles_sample_rate=1.0,
    integrations=[
        GRPCIntegration(),
    ],
)

...

# this works with synchronous servers:
server = grpc.server(thread_pool=...)

# ... and asynchronous servers:
server = grpc.aio.server()

```

### Client

```python {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "8-10", "profiling": "11-14"}}
import grpc

import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.grpc import GRPCIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for tracing.
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
    # Set profiles_sample_rate to 1.0 to profile 100%
    # of sampled transactions.
    # We recommend adjusting this value in production.
    profiles_sample_rate=1.0,
    integrations=[
        GRPCIntegration(),
    ],
)

...

# this works with synchronous clients:
with grpc.insecure_channel("example.com:12345") as channel:
    ...

# ... and asynchronous clients:
async with grpc.aio.insecure_channel("example.com:12345") as channel:
    ...
```

<Note>

**Note:**

In older versions of this integration you had to add the interceptors by hand. Since Python SDK version 1.35.0 you do not need to add any interceptors by hand but only add the GRPCIntegration as described above.

</Note>

## Verify

### Server

If you added the `GRPCIntegration` as described above, the server will create a transaction for each call to a function and send it to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

It takes a couple of moments for the data to appear in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

### Client

```python
import grpc

sentry_sdk.init(...)  # same as above

...

with sentry_sdk.start_transaction(op="function", name="testing_sentry"):
    with grpc.insecure_channel("example.com:12345") as channel:
        stub = helloworld_pb2_grpc.GreeterStub(channel)
        response = stub.SayHello(helloworld_pb2.HelloRequest(name="you"))

```

This will create a transaction called `testing_sentry` in the Performance section of [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and will create a span for the call to the `SayHello` method on the server.

The transaction created in the client will also be connected to the transaction on the server, giving you a full trace of your request.

If you use a framework (like Django, Flask, FastAPI, etc.) the transaction will be created for you automatically.

It takes a couple of moments for the data to appear in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).
