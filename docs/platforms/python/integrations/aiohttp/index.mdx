The AIOHTTP integration adds support for the [AIOHTTP server web framework](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/web.html).

If you use AIOHTTP as your HTTP client and want to instrument outgoing HTTP requests, have a look at the <PlatformLink to="/integrations/aiohttp/aiohttp-client/">AIOHTTP client documentation</PlatformLink>.

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI with the `aiohttp` extra:

```bash
pip install --upgrade sentry-sdk[aiohttp]
```

If you're on Python 3.6, you also need the `aiocontextvars` package:

```bash
pip install --upgrade aiocontextvars
```

## Configure

If you have the `aiohttp` package in your dependencies, the AIOHTTP integration will be enabled automatically when you initialize the Sentry SDK.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-config" />

## Verify

```python
from aiohttp import web

sentry_sdk.init(...)  # same as above

async def hello(request):
    1 / 0  # raises an error
    return web.Response(text="Hello, world")

app = web.Application()
app.add_routes([web.get('/', hello)])

web.run_app(app)
```

When you point your browser to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) a transaction will be created in the Performance section of [sentry.io](https://sentry.io). Additionally, an error event will be sent to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and will be connected to the transaction.

It takes a couple of moments for the data to appear in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

## Behavior

- The Sentry Python SDK will install the AIOHTTP integration for all of your apps.
- All exceptions leading to an Internal Server Error are reported.
- _The AIOHTTP integration currently does not attach the request body_, see [GitHub issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/issues/220).
- Logging with any logger will create breadcrumbs when the [Logging](/platforms/python/integrations/logging/) integration is enabled (done by default).

## Options

By adding `AioHttpIntegration` to your `sentry_sdk.init()` call explicitly, you can set options for `AioHttpIntegration` to change its behavior:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.aiohttp import AioHttpIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    # same as above
    integrations=[
        AioHttpIntegration(
            transaction_style="...",  # type: str
            failed_request_status_codes={...}  # type: collections.abc.Set[int]
        ),
    ],
)
```

You can pass the following keyword arguments to `AioHttpIntegration()`:

### `transaction_style`

Configure the way Sentry names transactions:

- `GET /path/{id}` if you set `transaction_style="method_and_path_pattern"`
- `<module_name>.hello` if you set `transaction_style="handler_name"`

The default is `"handler_name"`.

### `failed_request_status_codes`

A `set` of integers that will determine when an `HTTPException` should be reported to Sentry. The `HTTPException` is reported to Sentry if its status code is contained in the `failed_request_status_codes` set.

Examples of valid `failed_request_status_codes`:

- `{500}` will only report `HTTPException` with status 500 (i.e. `HTTPInternalServerError`).
- `{400, *range(500, 600)}` will report `HTTPException` with status 400 (i.e. `HTTPBadRequest`) as well as those in the 5xx range.
- `set()` (the empty set) will not report any `HTTPException` to Sentry.

The default is `{*range(500, 600)}`, meaning that any `HTTPException` with a status in the 5xx range is reported to Sentry.

Regardless of how `failed_request_status_codes` is set, any exceptions raised by the handler, which are not of type `HTTPException` (or a subclass) are reported to Sentry. For example, if your request handler raises an unhandled `AttributeError`, the `AttributeError` gets reported to Sentry, even if you have set `failed_request_status_codes=set()`.
