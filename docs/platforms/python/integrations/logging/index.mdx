The logging integration adds support for the `logging` framework from Python's standard library. Depending on your settings, logs can be captured as Sentry logs, as error events, or as breadcrumbs, or a combination of those.

<Alert level="info" title="Sentry Logs">

Enable the Sentry Logs feature with `sentry_sdk.init(enable_logs=True)` to unlock Sentry's full logging power. With Sentry Logs, you can search, filter, and analyze logs from across your entire application in one place.

</Alert>

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI:

```bash {tabTitle:pip}
pip install "sentry-sdk"
```

```bash {tabTitle:uv}
uv add "sentry-sdk"
```

## Configure

To capture log records as [Sentry logs](/platforms/python/logs/), set `enable_logs` to `True`. The logging integration is a default integration, so it will be enabled automatically when you initialize the Sentry SDK.

```python
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    # Add data like request headers and IP for users, if applicable;
    # see https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/data-management/data-collected/ for more info
    send_default_pii=True,
    enable_logs=True,
)
```

## Verify

```python
import logging

def main():
    sentry_sdk.init(...)  # same as above
    logging.info("Logging some info")
    logging.error("Logging an error")

main()
```

This will capture both logs and send them to Sentry Logs. Additionally, an error event will be created from the `ERROR`-level log. In addition to that, a breadcrumb will be created from the `INFO`-level log.

## Behavior

As long as `enable_logs` is `True`, logs with a level of `INFO` and higher will be captured as Sentry logs if the log level set in the `logging` module is `INFO` or below. The threshold can be configured via the [`sentry_logs_level` option](#options).

Additionally, the logging integration will create an error event from all `ERROR`-level logs. This feature is configurable via the [`event_level` integration option](#options).

`INFO` and above logs will also be captured as breadcrumbs. Use the [`level` integration option](#options) to adjust the threshold.

```python
import logging

import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    ...,
    enable_logs=True,
)

# The following will be captured as Sentry logs:
logging.info("I'm an INFO log")
logging.error("I'm an ERROR log", extra={"bar": 43})
logging.exception("I'm an exception log")

# DEBUG-level logs won't be captured by default
logging.debug("I'm a DEBUG log")
```

- All of the above logs except for the `DEBUG` level message will be sent to Sentry as logs.
- An error event with the message `"I'm an ERROR log"` will be created.
- `"I'm an INFO log"` will be attached as a breadcrumb to that event.
- `bar` will end up in the `extra` attributes of that event.
- `"I'm an exception log"` will send the current exception from `sys.exc_info()` with the stack trace to Sentry. If there's no exception, the current stack will be attached.
- The debug message `"I'm a DEBUG log"` will not be captured by Sentry. See the [`sentry_logs_level` option](#option) to adjust which levels should be sent to Sentry as logs, and the [`level` option](#option) to do adjust the level for capturing breadcrumbs.


### Working with Extra Fields

When sending log records as Sentry logs, any fields provided in the `extra` dictionary are automatically promoted to top-level attributes on the log entry. This makes them searchable and filterable in the Sentry UI.

```python
import logging
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    # ...
    enable_logs=True,
)

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Extra fields become top-level searchable attributes
logger.error(
    "Payment processing failed", 
    extra={
        "user_id": 12345,
        "transaction_id": "txn_abc123", 
        "payment_method": "credit_card",
        "amount": 99.99
    }
)
```

In this example, `user_id`, `transaction_id`, `payment_method`, and `amount` will appear as separate, searchable attributes in the Sentry logs interface, not nested within an `extra` object. You can filter and query logs using these attributes directly, such as `user_id:12345` or `payment_method:credit_card`.

## Options

To change the default behavior of the logging integration, instantiate the integration manually and pass it to Sentry's `init` function:

```python
import logging
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.logging import LoggingIntegration

# The SDK will honor the level set by the logging library, which is WARNING by default.
# If we want to capture records with lower severity, we need to configure
# the logger level first.
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

sentry_sdk.init(
    # ...
    integrations=[
        LoggingIntegration(
            sentry_logs_level=logging.INFO,  # Capture INFO and above as logs
            level=logging.INFO,              # Capture INFO and above as breadcrumbs
            event_level=logging.ERROR,       # Send ERROR records as events
        ),
    ],
)
```

You can pass the following keyword arguments to `LoggingIntegration()`:

- `sentry_logs_level` (default `INFO`): The Sentry Python SDK will capture records with a level higher than or equal to `sentry_logs_level` as [Sentry structured logs](/platforms/python/logs/) as long as the `enable_logs` option is `True`.

  ```python
  sentry_sdk.init(
      # ...
      enable_logs=True,
  )
  ```

- `level` (default `INFO`): The Sentry Python SDK will record log records with a level higher than or equal to `level` as breadcrumbs. Inversely, the SDK completely ignores any log record with a level lower than this one. If a value of `None` occurs, the SDK won't send log records as breadcrumbs.

- `event_level` (default `ERROR`): The Sentry Python SDK will report log records with a level higher than or equal to `event_level` as events as long as the logger itself is set to output records of those log levels (see note below). If a value of `None` occurs, the SDK won't send log records as events.




## Ignoring a logger

Sometimes a logger is extremely noisy and spams you with pointless errors. You can ignore that logger by calling `ignore_logger`:

```python
from sentry_sdk.integrations.logging import ignore_logger

ignore_logger("a.spammy.logger")

logger = logging.getLogger("a.spammy.logger")
logger.error("hi")  # no error sent to sentry
```

You can also use `before-send` and `before-breadcrumb` to ignore
only certain messages. See <PlatformLink to="/configuration/filtering/">Filtering Events</PlatformLink> for more information.

## Handler classes

Instead of using `LoggingIntegration`, you can use two regular logging `logging.Handler` subclasses that the integration exports.

**Usually, you don't need this.** You _can_ use this together with `default_integrations=False` if you want to opt into what the Sentry Python SDK captures. However, correctly setting up logging is difficult. Also, an opt-in approach to capture data will miss errors you may not think of on your own.

See the [API documentation](https://getsentry.github.io/sentry-python/integrations.html#module-sentry_sdk.integrations.logging) for more information.

## Troubleshooting

<Expandable title="Logs not appearing in Sentry">

  First, make sure you have the `enable_logs=True` option in your `sentry_sdk.init()` and you're on the latest version of the SDK.

  The SDK will honor the configured level of each logger (set with `logger.setLevel(level)` or `logging.basicConfig(level=level)`). That means that you will not see any `INFO` or `DEBUG` events from a logger with the level set to `WARNING`, regardless of how you configure the integration. If not set explicitly, the logging level defaults to `WARNING`.

  Some frameworks, such as `uvicorn`, may reset or override your `logging` configuration. To ensure your log level is applied and logs at or above the configured level are picked up by the SDK, you can use the `force=True` flag when configuring your log level. For example `logger.setLevel(level, force=True)` and `logging.basicConfig(level=level, force=True)`.
