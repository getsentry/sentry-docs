The Ray integration adds support for the [Ray](https://www.ray.io/) unified compute framework.

## Install

To get started, install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI.

```bash
pip install --upgrade sentry-sdk
```

## Configure

Add `RayIntegration()` to your `integrations` list:


In addition to capturing errors, you can monitor interactions between multiple services or applications by [enabling tracing](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/). You can also collect and analyze performance profiles from real users with [profiling](/product/explore/profiling/).

Select which Sentry features you'd like to install in addition to Error Monitoring to get the corresponding installation and configuration instructions below.

<OnboardingOptionButtons
  options={["error-monitoring", "performance", "profiling"]}
/>

```python {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "12-14", "profiling": "15-18"}}
import ray

import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.ray import RayIntegration

def init_sentry():
    sentry_sdk.init(
        dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
        # Add data like request headers and IP for users, if applicable;
        # see https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/data-management/data-collected/ for more info
        send_default_pii=True,
        # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
        # of transactions for tracing.
        traces_sample_rate=1.0,
        # Set profiles_sample_rate to 1.0 to profile 100%
        # of sampled transactions.
        # We recommend adjusting this value in production.
        profiles_sample_rate=1.0,
        integrations=[
            RayIntegration(),
        ],
    )

init_sentry()

ray.init(
    runtime_env={"worker_process_setup_hook": init_sentry},
)
```

Be sure to call `sentry_sdk.init()` before you call `ray.init()`.

By setting the `worker_process_setup_hook` we make sure that `sentry_sdk.init()` is called inside Ray worker processes during startup. This allows Sentry to connect code running in the worker with the calling code.

## Verify

Trigger an error in your code to verify that the integration is sending events to Sentry.

```python
def init_sentry():
    sentry_sdk.init(...)  # same as above

init_sentry()

ray.init(
    runtime_env={"worker_process_setup_hook": init_sentry},
)

@ray.remote
def divide(a, b):
    return a/b

with sentry_sdk.start_transaction(name="ray-test"):
    futures = [
        divide.remote(10, 5),
        divide.remote(10, 0),
    ]
    print(ray.get(futures))
```

Running this will create an error event (`ZeroDivisionError`) that will be sent to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io). Additionally, trace information will be created in the Performance section of [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

## Behavior

- All unhandled exceptions will be captured and can be seen on [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).
- Performance data will be captured and available in the Performance section of [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).
- Performance data from [Ray Tasks](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/tasks.html) will be captured and linked to the calling code.
- **Note**: Capturing performance data from [Ray Actors](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/actors.html) is currently **not supported**. (As always, [PRs are welcome](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md))

## Supported Versions

- Ray: 2.34+
- Python: 3.8+
