The Starlette integration adds support for the [Starlette Framework](https://www.starlette.io/).

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI with the `starlette` extra:

```bash
pip install --upgrade 'sentry-sdk[starlette]'
```

## Configure

If you have the `starlette` package in your dependencies, the Starlette integration will be enabled automatically when you initialize the Sentry SDK.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-config" />

## Verify

```python
from starlette.applications import Starlette
from starlette.routing import Route

sentry_sdk.init(...)  # same as above

async def trigger_error(request):
    division_by_zero = 1 / 0

app = Starlette(routes=[
    Route("/sentry-debug", trigger_error),
])
```

When you point your browser to [http://localhost:8000/sentry-debug](http://localhost:8000/sentry-debug) a transaction will be created in the Performance section of [sentry.io](https://sentry.io). Additionally, an error event will be sent to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and will be connected to the transaction.

It takes a couple of moments for the data to appear in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

## Behavior

- By default, all exceptions leading to an Internal Server Error are reported. The HTTP status codes to report on are configurable via the `failed_request_status_codes` [option](#options).

- Request data is attached to all events: **HTTP method, URL, headers, form data, JSON payloads**. Sentry excludes raw bodies and multipart file uploads. Sentry also excludes personally identifiable information (such as user ids, usernames, cookies, authorization headers, IP addresses) unless you set `send_default_pii` to `True`.

- If `enable_tracing` or a `traces_sample_rate` is set, then performance information is also reported, which you can see on the **Performance** page of [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

## Options

By adding `StarletteIntegration` explicitly to your `sentry_sdk.init()` call you can set options for `StarletteIntegration` to change its behavior:

```python
from sentry_sdk.integrations.starlette import StarletteIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    # ...
    integrations=[
        StarletteIntegration(
            transaction_style="endpoint",
            failed_request_status_codes=[403, range(500, 599)],
            middleware_spans=False,
        )
    ],
)
```

You can pass the following keyword arguments to `StarletteIntegration()`:

- `transaction_style`:

  ```python
  async def product_detail(request):
      return JSONResponse({...})

  app = Starlette(routes=[
      Route('/catalog/product/{product_id}', product_detail),
  ])
  ```

  In the above code, the transaction name will be:

  - `"/catalog/product/{product_id}"` if you set `transaction_style="url"`.
  - `"product_detail"` if you set `transaction_style="endpoint"`

  The default is `"url"`.

- `failed_request_status_codes`:

  A list of integers or containers (objects that allow membership checks via `in`)
  of integers that will determine which status codes should be reported to Sentry.

  Examples of valid `failed_request_status_codes`:

  - `[500]` will only send events on HTTP 500.
  - `[400, range(500, 599)]` will send events on HTTP 400 as well as the 500-599 range.
  - `[500, 503]` will send events on HTTP 500 and 503.

  The default is `[range(500, 599)]`.

- `middleware_spans`:

  Create spans and track performance of all middleware in your Starlette project. Set to `False` to disable.

  The default is `True`.
