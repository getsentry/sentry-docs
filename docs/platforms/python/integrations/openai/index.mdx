<Alert level="info" title="Beta">

The support for **OpenAI** is in its beta phase.

We are working on supporting different AI libraries (see [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/discussions/3007)).

If you want to try the beta features and are willing to give feedback, please let us know on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Ww9hbqr).

</Alert>

This integration connects Sentry with the [OpenAI Python SDK](https://github.com/openai/openai-python).
The integration has been confirmed to work with OpenAI 1.13.3.

Once you've installed this SDK, you can use Sentry LLM Monitoring, a Sentry dashboard that helps you understand what's going on with your AI pipelines.

Sentry LLM Monitoring will automatically collect information about prompts, tokens, and models from providers like OpenAI. Learn more about it [here](/product/llm-monitoring).

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI with the `openai` extra:

```bash
pip install --upgrade 'sentry-sdk[openai]'
```

## Configure

If you have the `openai` package in your dependencies, the OpenAI integration will be enabled automatically when you initialize the Sentry SDK.

An additional dependency, `tiktoken`, is required if you want to calculate token usage for streaming chat responses.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-config" />

## Verify

Verify that the integration works by creating an AI pipeline. The resulting data should show up in your LLM monitoring dashboard.


```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.ai.monitoring import ai_track
from openai import OpenAI

sentry_sdk.init(...)  # same as above

client = OpenAI(api_key="(your OpenAI key)")

@ai_track("My AI pipeline")
def my_pipeline():
    with sentry_sdk.start_transaction(op="ai-inference", name="The result of the AI inference"):
      print(
          client.chat.completions.create(
              model="gpt-3.5", messages=[{"role": "system", "content": "say hello"}]
          )
          .choices[0]
          .message.content
      )
```

After running this script, a pipeline will be created in the [LLM Monitoring](/product/llm-monitoring) section of the Sentry dashboard. The pipeline will have an associated OpenAI span for the `chat.completions.create` operation.

It may take a couple of moments for the data to appear in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

## Behavior

- The OpenAI integration will connect Sentry with all supported OpenAI methods automatically.

- All exceptions leading to an OpenAIException are reported.

- The supported modules are currently `chat.completions.create` and `embeddings.create`.

- Sentry considers LLM and tokenizer inputs/outputs as PII and doesn't include PII data by default. If you want to include the data, set `send_default_pii=True` in the `sentry_sdk.init()` call. To explicitly exclude prompts and outputs despite `send_default_pii=True`, configure the integration with `include_prompts=False` as shown in the [Options section](#options) below.

## Options

By adding `OpenAIIntegration` to your `sentry_sdk.init()` call explicitly, you can set options for `OpenAIIntegration` to change its behavior:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.openai import OpenAIIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    # ...
    send_default_pii=True,
    integrations = [
        OpenAIIntegration(
            include_prompts=False, # LLM/tokenizer inputs/outputs will be not sent to Sentry, despite send_default_pii=True
        ),
    ],
)
```

## Supported Versions

- OpenAI: 1.0+
- tiktoken: 0.6.0+
- Python: 3.9+
