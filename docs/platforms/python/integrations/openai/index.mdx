<Alert level="info" title="Beta">

The support for **OpenAI** is in its beta phase. It is not yet fully ready for the public.

We are working on supporting different AI libraries (see [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/discussions/3007))

If you want to try the beta features and are willing to give feedback, please shoot us a line on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Ww9hbqr).

</Alert>

This integration connects Sentry with the [OpenAI Python SDK](https://github.com/openai/openai-python).
The integration has been confirmed to work with OpenAI 1.13.3.

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI with the `openai` extra:

```bash
pip install --upgrade 'sentry-sdk[openai]'
```

## Configure

If you have the `openai` package in your dependencies, the OpenAI integration will be enabled automatically when you initialize the Sentry SDK.

An additional dependency, `tiktoken`, is required if you want to calculate token usage for streaming chat responses.

<SignInNote />

```python
from openai import OpenAI

import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    enable_tracing=True,
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
)

client = OpenAI()
```

## Verify

Verify that the integration works by inducing an error. The error and performance transaction should appear in your Sentry project.
```python
from openai import OpenAI
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(...)  # same as above

client = OpenAI(api_key="a bad API key")
with sentry_sdk.start_transaction(op="ai-inference", name="The result of the AI inference"):
    response = (
        client.chat.completions.create(
            model="some-model", messages=[{"role": "system", "content": "hello"}]
        )
        .choices[0]
        .message.content
    )
    print(response)
```

After running this script, a transaction will be created in the Performance section of [sentry.io](https://sentry.io). Additionally, an error event (about the bad API key) will be sent to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and will be connected to the transaction.

It takes a couple of moments for the data to appear in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

## Behavior

- The OpenAI integration will connect Sentry with all supported OpenAI methods automatically.

- All exceptions leading to an OpenAIException are reported.

- The supported modules are currently `chat.completions.create` and `embeddings.create`.

- Sentry is configured not to consider LLM and tokenizer inputs/outputs as PII. If you want to include them, set `send_default_pii=True` in the `sentry_sdk.init()` call. To explicitly exclude prompts despite `send_default_pii=True`, configure the integration with `include_prompts=False` like in the Options section.

## Options

By adding `OpenAIIntegration` to your `sentry_sdk.init()` call explicitly, you can set options for `OpenAIIntegration` to change its behavior:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.openai import OpenAIIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    enable_tracing=True,
    send_default_pii=True,
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
    integrations = [
        OpenAIIntegration(
            include_prompts=False, # LLM/tokenizer inputs/outputs will be not sent to Sentry, despite send_default_pii=True
        ),
    ],
)
```

## Supported Versions

- OpenAI: 1.0+
- tiktoken: 0.6.0+
- Python: 3.9+
