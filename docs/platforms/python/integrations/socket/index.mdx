Use this integration to create spans for DNS resolves and socket connection creations.

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk`` from PyPI.

```bash
pip install --upgrade 'sentry-sdk'
```

## Configure

Add `SocketIntegration()` to your `integrations` list:


In addition to capturing errors, you can monitor interactions between multiple services or applications by [enabling tracing](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/). You can also collect and analyze performance profiles from real users with [profiling](/product/explore/profiling/).

Select which Sentry features you'd like to install in addition to Error Monitoring to get the corresponding installation and configuration instructions below.

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.socket import SocketIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    # Add data like request headers and IP for users, if applicable;
    # see https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/data-management/data-collected/ for more info
    send_default_pii=True,
    # ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ performance
    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for tracing.
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
    # ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ performance
    # ___PRODUCT_OPTION_START___ profiling
    # Set profiles_sample_rate to 1.0 to profile 100%
    # of sampled transactions.
    # We recommend adjusting this value in production.
    profiles_sample_rate=1.0,
    # ___PRODUCT_OPTION_END___ profiling
    integrations=[
        SocketIntegration(),
    ],
)
```

## Verify

```python
import socket

def main():
    sentry_init(...)  # same as above
    with sentry_sdk.start_transaction(name="testing_sentry"):
        timeout = 10
        socket.getaddrinfo("sentry.io", 443)
        socket.create_connection(("sentry.io", 443), timeout, None)
main()
```

This example will create a transaction called `testing_sentry` in the Performance section of [sentry.io](https://sentry.io), and create spans for the socket commands.

It takes a couple of moments for the data to appear in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).
