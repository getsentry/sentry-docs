The Dramatiq integration adds support for the
[Dramatiq](https://dramatiq.io/) background tasks library.

<Alert level="info">
  This is the successor of the original `DramatiqIntegration` that can be found here: https://github.com/jacobsvante/sentry-dramatiq

  The original maintainer has [donated the integration to Sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/issues/3387), so we can take over maintenance.
</Alert>

## Install

To get started, install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI.

```bash
pip install --upgrade sentry-sdk
```

## Configure

Add `DramatiqIntegration()` to your `integrations` list:


In addition to capturing errors, you can monitor interactions between multiple services or applications by [enabling tracing](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/). You can also collect and analyze performance profiles from real users with [profiling](/product/explore/profiling/).

Select which Sentry features you'd like to install in addition to Error Monitoring to get the corresponding installation and configuration instructions below.

<OnboardingOptionButtons
  options={["error-monitoring", "performance", "profiling"]}
/>

```python {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "6-8", "profiling": "9-12"}}
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.dramatiq import DramatiqIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for tracing.
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
    # Set profiles_sample_rate to 1.0 to profile 100%
    # of sampled transactions.
    # We recommend adjusting this value in production.
    profiles_sample_rate=1.0,
    integrations=[
        DramatiqIntegration(),
    ],
)
```

## Verify

Trigger an error in your code to verify that the integration is sending events to Sentry.

```python
import dramatiq

import sentry_sdk
sentry_sdk.init(...)  # same as above

@dramatiq.actor(max_retries=0)
def dummy_actor(x, y):
    return x / y

dummy_actor.send(5, 0)
```

Running this will create an error event (`ZeroDivisionError`) that you should be able to see in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).
