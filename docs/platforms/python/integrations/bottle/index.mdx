The Bottle integration adds support for the [Bottle web framework](https://bottlepy.org/).
Currently it works well with the stable version of Bottle (0.12).
However the integration with the development version (0.13) doesn't work properly.

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI with the `bottle` extra:

```bash
pip install --upgrade 'sentry-sdk[bottle]'
```

## Configure

If you have the `bottle` package in your dependencies, the Bottle integration will be enabled automatically when you initialize the Sentry SDK.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-config" />

## Verify

```python
from bottle import Bottle, run

sentry_sdk.init(...)  # same as above

app = Bottle()

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    1 / 0
    return "Hello World!"

run(app, host='localhost', port=8000)
```

When you point your browser to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) a transaction in the Performance section of [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) will be created. Additionally, an error event will be sent to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and will be connected to the transaction.

It takes a couple of moments for the data to appear in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

## Behavior

<Include name="python-uwsgi-warning.mdx" />

- The Sentry Python SDK will install the Bottle integration for all of your apps. The integration hooks into base Bottle class.

- All exceptions leading to an Internal Server Error are reported.

- Request data is attached to all events: **HTTP method, URL, headers, form data, JSON payloads**. Sentry excludes raw bodies and multipart file uploads. Sentry also excludes personally identifiable information (such as user ids, usernames, cookies, authorization headers, IP addresses) unless you set `send_default_pii` to `True`.

- Each request has a separate scope. Changes to the scope within a view, for example setting a tag, will only apply to events sent as part of the request being handled.

## Options

If you add `BottleIntegration` explicitly to your `sentry_sdk.init()` call you can set options for `BottleIntegration` to change its behavior:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.bottle import BottleIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    # same as above
    integrations=[
        BottleIntegration(
            transaction_style="endpoint",
            failed_request_status_codes={*range(500, 600)},
        ),
    ],
)

```

Each of the following options are supported as keyword arguments to `BottleIntegration()`.

### `transaction_style`

The `transaction_style` option specifies how the transaction name is generated. You can set the option to `"endpoint"` (the default) or `"url"`.

For example, given the following route:

```python
@app.route("/myurl/<foo>")
def myendpoint():
    return "ok"
```

- If you set `transaction_style="endpoint"`, the transaction name will be `"myendpoint"`, since that is the route handler function's name.
- If you set `transaction_style="url"`, the transaction name will be `"/myurl/<foo>"`, since that is the URL path.


### `failed_request_status_codes`

A `set` of integers that will determine when an [`HTTPResponse`](https://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/api.html#bottle.HTTPResponse), which is raised or returned by the request handler, should be reported to Sentry. The `HTTPResponse` is reported to Sentry if its status code is contained in the `failed_request_status_codes` set.

Examples of valid values for `failed_request_status_codes`:

- `{500}` will only report `HTTPResponse` with status 500.
- `{400, *range(500, 600)}` will report `HTTPResponse` with status 400 as well as those in the 5xx range.
- `set()` (the empty set) will not report any `HTTPResponse` to Sentry.

The default is `{*range(500, 600)}`, meaning that any `HTTPResponse` with a status in the 5xx range is reported to Sentry.

Regardless of how `failed_request_status_codes` is configured, any non-`HTTPResponse` exceptions raised by the handler are reported to Sentry. For example, if your request handler raises an unhandled `AttributeError`, the `AttributeError` gets reported to Sentry, even if you have set `failed_request_status_codes=set()`.
