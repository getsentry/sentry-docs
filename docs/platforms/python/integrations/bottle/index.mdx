The Bottle integration adds support for the [Bottle web framework](https://bottlepy.org/).
Currently it works well with the stable version of Bottle (0.12).
However the integration with the development version (0.13) doesn't work properly.

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI with the `bottle` extra:

```bash
pip install --upgrade 'sentry-sdk[bottle]'
```

## Configure

If you have the `bottle` package in your dependencies, the Bottle integration will be enabled automatically when you initialize the Sentry SDK.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-config" />

## Verify

```python
from bottle import Bottle, run

sentry_sdk.init(...)  # same as above

app = Bottle()

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    1 / 0
    return "Hello World!"

run(app, host='localhost', port=8000)
```

When you point your browser to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) a transaction in the Performance section of [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) will be created. Additionally, an error event will be sent to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and will be connected to the transaction.

It takes a couple of moments for the data to appear in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

## Behavior

<Include name="python-uwsgi-warning.mdx" />

- The Sentry Python SDK will install the Bottle integration for all of your apps. The integration hooks into base Bottle class.

- All exceptions leading to an Internal Server Error are reported.

- Request data is attached to all events: **HTTP method, URL, headers, form data, JSON payloads**. Sentry excludes raw bodies and multipart file uploads. Sentry also excludes personally identifiable information (such as user ids, usernames, cookies, authorization headers, IP addresses) unless you set `send_default_pii` to `True`.

- Each request has a separate scope. Changes to the scope within a view, for example setting a tag, will only apply to events sent as part of the request being handled.

## Options

If you add `BottleIntegration` explicitly to your `sentry_sdk.init()` call you can set options for `BottleIntegration` to change its behavior:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.bottle import BottleIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    # same as above
    integrations=[
        BottleIntegration(
            transaction_style="endpoint",
        ),
    ],
)

```

You can pass the following keyword arguments to `BottleIntegration()`:

- `transaction_style`:

  ```python
  @app.route("/myurl/<foo>")
  def myendpoint():
      return "ok"
  ```

  In the above code, you would set the transaction to:

  - `/myurl/<foo>` if you set `transaction_style="url"`.
  - `myendpoint` if you set `transaction_style="endpoint"`

  The default is `"endpoint"`.

## Supported Versions

- Bottle: 0.12.13+
- Python: 3.6+
