The Tornado integration adds support for the [Tornado web framework](https://www.tornadoweb.org/).

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI with the `tornado` extra:

```bash {tabTitle:pip}
pip install "sentry-sdk[tornado]"
```
```bash {tabTitle:uv}
uv add "sentry-sdk[tornado]"
```

## Configure

If you have the `tornado` package in your dependencies, the Tornado integration will be enabled automatically when you initialize the Sentry SDK.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-config" />

## Verify

```python
import asyncio
import tornado

sentry_sdk.init(...)  # same as above

class MainHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    def get(self):
        1 / 0  # raises an error
        self.write("Hello, world")

def make_app():
    return tornado.web.Application([
        (r"/", MainHandler),
    ])

async def main():
    app = make_app()
    app.listen(8888)
    await asyncio.Event().wait()

asyncio.run(main())
```

When you point your browser to [http://localhost:8888/](http://localhost:8888/) a transaction in the Performance section of [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) will be created. Additionally, an error event will be sent to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and will be connected to the transaction.

It takes a couple of moments for the data to appear in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

## Behavior

- The Tornado integration will be installed for all of your apps and handlers.
- All exceptions leading to a Internal Server Error are reported.
- Request data is attached to all events: **HTTP method, URL, headers, form data, JSON payloads**. Sentry excludes raw bodies and multipart file uploads. Sentry also excludes personally identifiable information (such as user ids, usernames, cookies, authorization headers, IP addresses) unless you set `send_default_pii` to `True`.
- Each request has a separate scope. Changes to the scope within a view, for example setting a tag, will only apply to events sent as part of the request being handled.
- Logging with any logger will create breadcrumbs when the [Logging](/platforms/python/integrations/logging/) integration is enabled (done by default).

### Tracing

A set of predefined span attributes will be attached to Tornado transactions by default. These can also be used for sampling since they will also be accessible via the `sampling_context` dictionary in the [`traces_sampler`](/platforms/python/configuration/options/#traces_sampler).

- `url.path`
- `url.query`
- `url.scheme`
- `url.full`
- `http.request.method`
- `http.request.header.{header}`
- `server.address`
- `server.port`
- `network.protocol.name`
- `network.protocol.version`

These attributes will also be sent to Sentry. If you don't want that, you can filter them out using a custom [`before_send`](/platforms/python/configuration/options/#before_send) function.

## Supported Versions

- Tornado: 6+
- Python: 3.8+
