The [Loguru](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru#readme) integration lets you capture log messages and send them to Sentry. Depending on your settings, Loguru logs can be captured as Sentry logs, as error events, or as breadcrumbs, or a combination of those.

The [`logging`](/platforms/python/integrations/logging) integration provides most of the Loguru functionality and most examples on that page work with Loguru.

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI with the `loguru` extra.

```bash {tabTitle:pip}
pip install "sentry-sdk[loguru]"
```

```bash {tabTitle:uv}
uv add "sentry-sdk[loguru]"
```

## Configure

To capture Loguru log records as [Sentry logs](/platforms/python/logs/), set `enable_logs` to `True`. The integration itself doesn't need to be added manually. If you have the `loguru` package in your dependencies, the Loguru integration will be enabled automatically when you initialize the Sentry SDK.

```python
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    # Add data like request headers and IP for users, if applicable;
    # see https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/data-management/data-collected/ for more info
    send_default_pii=True,
    enable_logs=True,
)
```

## Verify

```python
from loguru import logger

def main():
    sentry_sdk.init(...)  # same as above
    logger.info("Logging some info")
    logger.error("Logging an error")

main()
```

This will capture both logs and send them to Sentry Logs. Additionally, an error event will be created from the `ERROR`-level log. In addition to that, a breadcrumb will be created from the `INFO`-level log.


## Behavior

As long as `enable_logs` is `True`, logs with a level of `INFO` and higher will be captured as Sentry logs. The threshold can be configured via the [`sentry_logs_level` option](#options).

Additionally, the Loguru integration will create an error event from all `ERROR`-level logs. This feature is configurable via the [`event_level` integration option](#options).

`INFO` and above logs will also be captured as breadcrumbs. Use the [`level` integration option](#options) to adjust the threshold.

The following snippet demonstrates the default behavior:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from loguru import logger

sentry_sdk.init(
    ...,
    enable_logs=True,
)

# The following will be captured as Sentry logs:
logger.info("I'm an INFO log")
logger.error("I'm an ERROR log", extra={"bar": 43})
logger.exception("I'm an exception log")

# DEBUG-level logs won't be captured by default
logger.debug("I'm a DEBUG log")
```

- All of the above logs except for the `DEBUG`-level message will be sent to Sentry as logs.
- An error event with the message `"I'm an exception log"` will be created.
- `"I'm an INFO log"` will be attached as a breadcrumb to that event.
- `bar` will end up in the `extra` attributes of that event.
- `"I'm an exception log"` will send the current exception from `sys.exc_info()` with the stack trace to Sentry. If there's no exception, the current stack will be attached.
- The debug message `"I'm a DEBUG log"` will not be captured by Sentry. See the [`sentry_logs_level` option](#option) to adjust which log levels should be sent to Sentry as logs, and the [`level` option](#option) to adjust the level for capturing breadcrumbs.


### Ignoring a logger

Loggers can be noisy. You can ignore a logger by calling `ignore_logger`.

Since most of the logic is proxied to `logging` integration, we use it instead of the Loguru integration:

```python
# Import form `logging` integration
from sentry_sdk.integrations.logging import ignore_logger

ignore_logger("a.spammy.logger")
```

In `a.spammy.logger` module:

```python
from loguru import logger
logger.error("hi")  # Nothing is sent to Sentry
```

This will work with `logging`'s logger too

```python
logger = logging.getLogger("a.spammy.logger")
logger.error("hi") # Again, nothing is sent to Sentry
```

You can also use `before_send_log` (for Sentry logs), `before_send` (for Sentry errors) and `before_breadcrumb` (for breadcrumbs) to ignore only certain messages. See <PlatformLink to="/configuration/filtering/">Filtering Events</PlatformLink> for more information.

## Options

You can pass the following keyword arguments to `LoguruIntegration()`:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from loguru import logger

from sentry_sdk.integrations.loguru import LoguruIntegration
from sentry_sdk.integrations.loguru import LoggingLevels

sentry_sdk.init(
    # ...
    integrations=[
        LoguruIntegration(
            sentry_logs_level=LoggingLevels.INFO.value,  # Capture INFO and above as logs
            level=LoggingLevels.INFO.value,              # Capture INFO and above as breadcrumbs
            event_level=LoggingLevels.ERROR.value,       # Send ERROR logs as events
        )
    ],
)
```


- `sentry_logs_level`

  The Sentry Python SDK will capture log records with a level higher than or equal to `sentry_logs_level` as [Sentry structured logs](/platforms/python/logs/). If set to `None`, the SDK won't send records as logs.

  To capture Loguru log records as Sentry logs, you must enable the `enable_logs` option when initializing the SDK (regardless of the `sentry_logs_level` setting).

  ```python
  sentry_sdk.init(
      # ...
      enable_logs=True,
  )
  ```

  Default: `INFO`

- `level`

  The Sentry Python SDK will record log records with a level higher than or equal to `level` as breadcrumbs. Inversely, the SDK will not capture breadcrumbs for logs with a level lower than this one. If set to `None`, the SDK won't send log records as breadcrumbs.

  Default: `INFO`

- `event_level`

  The Sentry Python SDK will report log records with a level higher than or equal to `event_level` as events. If set to `None`, the SDK won't send log records as events.

  Default: `ERROR`
