The Beam integration currently parses the functions in [ParDo](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/release-2.13.0/sdks/python/apache_beam/transforms/core.py#L991) to return exceptions in their respective `setup`, `start_bundle`, `process`, and `finish_bundle` functions.

**This integration is experimental.** It may be removed in minor versions. When enabling this integration, expect to see incorrect `server_name` and `ip` due to some distributed properties within Beam.

A Beam version of 2.12 or later is required.

Add `BeamIntegration()` to your `integrations` list:

<SignInNote />

<OnboardingOptionButtons
  options={[
    'error-monitoring',
    'performance',
    'profiling',
  ]}
/>

```python {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "6-8", "profiling": "9-12"}}
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.beam import BeamIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for performance monitoring.
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
    # Set profiles_sample_rate to 1.0 to profile 100%
    # of sampled transactions.
    # We recommend adjusting this value in production.
    profiles_sample_rate=1.0,
    integrations=[
        BeamIntegration(),
    ],
)
```

## Behavior

- The functions get injected with an inspect function to patch getting the [function signature](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/release-2.13.0/sdks/python/apache_beam/transforms/core.py#L288L298).
- The integration requires Sentry to be installed on all the worker computers using a `--requirements_file`.
- The main computer invoking the pipeline requires the same version of Sentry as the worker nodes.
