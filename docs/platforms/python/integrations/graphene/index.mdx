---

The Graphene integration captures errors from the
[Graphene GraphQL library](https://graphene-python.org/), which can then be viewed
in [Sentry](https://sentry.io).

## Install

To get started, install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI.

```bash
pip install --upgrade sentry-sdk
```

## Configure

If you have the `graphene` package in your dependencies, the Graphene integration will be enabled automatically when you initialize the Sentry SDK.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-config" />

## Verify

```python
import graphene

sentry_sdk.init(...)  # same as above

class Query(graphene.ObjectType):
    hello = graphene.String()

    def resolve_hello(self, info):
        1 / 0
        return "World"

schema = graphene.Schema(query=Query)

schema.execute("""
  query {
    hello
  }
""")
```

We've snuck a `ZeroDivisionError` into our `resolve_hello` resolver to ensure things are working as intended. When this
code snippet is run, a new error event should appear in the Issues section of
[sentry.io](https://sentry.io). It will take a couple of moments for the data to appear in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

## Options

When used together with one of our web framework integrations like
[FastAPI](/platforms/python/integrations/fastapi) or
[Flask](/platforms/python/integrations/flask), the Graphene
integration can capture the request body for each GraphQL error that happens.
Since the requests may contain sensitive data, no request bodies will be attached
by default.

To capture request bodies:

- Initialize the SDK with the
  [send_default_pii](/platforms/python/configuration/options/#send-default-pii)
  option set to `True`.
- Make sure the integration for the web framework you're using is enabled.

```python
sentry_sdk.init(
    # same options as above
    send_default_pii=True,
)
```

<Alert level="warning" title="Note">

Since `send_default_pii` is a global SDK option, setting it to `True` affects all
integrations, not just Graphene. Please make sure to take care of
[scrubbing sensitive data](/platforms/python/data-management/sensitive-data/)
from events before enabling this option.

</Alert>
