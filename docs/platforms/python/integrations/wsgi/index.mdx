If you use a WSGI framework not directly supported by the SDK, or wrote a raw WSGI app, you can use this generic WSGI middleware. It captures errors and attaches a basic amount of information for incoming requests.

<Note>

If you use an WSGI framework, please use our specific integrations for [Flask](/platforms/python/integrations/flask/), [Bottle](/platforms/python/integrations/bottle/), [Falcon](/platforms/python/integrations/falcon/), [Pyramid](/platforms/python/integrations/pyramid/), and [Tryton](/platforms/python/integrations/tryton/) instead of this WSGI middleware as those are easier to use and capture more useful information.

</Note>

## Install

```bash
pip install --upgrade 'sentry-sdk'
```

## Configure

<SignInNote />

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.wsgi import SentryWsgiMiddleware

from my_wsgi_app import app

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    enable_tracing=True,
)

app = SentryWsgiMiddleware(app)
```

## Verify

This minimal WSGI application will create a transaction and send it to Sentry. The error will also be sent to Sentry and associated with the transaction:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.wsgi import SentryWsgiMiddleware

sentry_sdk.init(...)  # same as above

def app(env, start_response):
    start_response('200 OK', [('Content-Type', 'text/plain')])
    response_body = 'Hello World'
    1/0  # this raises an error
    return [response_body.encode()]

app = SentryWsgiMiddleware(app)

# Run the application in a mini WSGI server.
from wsgiref.simple_server import make_server
make_server('', 8000, app).serve_forever()
```

## Behavior

<Include name="python-uwsgi-warning.mdx" />

- Request data is attached to all events: **HTTP method, URL, headers**. Sentry excludes raw bodies and multipart file uploads. Sentry also excludes personally identifiable information (such as user ids, usernames, cookies, authorization headers, IP addresses) unless you set `send_default_pii` to `True`.

Each request has a separate scope. Changes to the scope within a view, for example setting a tag, will only apply to events sent as part of the request being handled.

- The WSGI middleware does not behave like a regular integration. It is not initialized through an extra parameter to `init` and is not attached to a client. When capturing or supplementing events, it just uses the currently active hub.

## Supported Versions

- Python: 2.7+
