If you use a WSGI framework not directly supported by the SDK, or wrote a raw WSGI app, you can use this generic WSGI middleware. It captures errors and attaches a basic amount of information for incoming requests.

<Note>

Please check our list of [supported integrations](/platforms/python/integrations/) as there might already be a specific integration (like [Django](/platforms/python/integrations/django/) or [Flask](/platforms/python/integrations/flask/)) that is easier to use and captures more useful information than our generic WSGI middleware. If that's the case, you should use the specific integration instead of this middleware.
</Note>

## Install

```bash
pip install --upgrade 'sentry-sdk'
```

## Configure

<SignInNote />

<OnboardingOptionButtons
  options={[
    'error-monitoring',
    'performance',
    'profiling',
  ]}
/>

```python {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "8-10", "profiling": "11-14"}}
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.wsgi import SentryWsgiMiddleware

from my_wsgi_app import app

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for performance monitoring.
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
    # Set profiles_sample_rate to 1.0 to profile 100%
    # of sampled transactions.
    # We recommend adjusting this value in production.
    profiles_sample_rate=1.0,
)

app = SentryWsgiMiddleware(app)
```

## Verify

This minimal WSGI application will create a transaction and send it to Sentry. The error will also be sent to Sentry and associated with the transaction:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.wsgi import SentryWsgiMiddleware

sentry_sdk.init(...)  # same as above

def app(env, start_response):
    start_response('200 OK', [('Content-Type', 'text/plain')])
    response_body = 'Hello World'
    1 / 0  # this raises an error
    return [response_body.encode()]

app = SentryWsgiMiddleware(app)

# Run the application in a mini WSGI server.
from wsgiref.simple_server import make_server
make_server('', 8000, app).serve_forever()
```

## Behavior

<Include name="python-uwsgi-warning.mdx" />

- Request data is attached to all events: **HTTP method, URL, headers**. Sentry excludes raw bodies and multipart file uploads. Sentry also excludes personally identifiable information (such as user ids, usernames, cookies, authorization headers, IP addresses) unless you set `send_default_pii` to `True`.

Each request has a separate scope. Changes to the scope within a view, for example setting a tag, will only apply to events sent as part of the request being handled.

- The WSGI middleware does not behave like a regular integration. It is not initialized through an extra parameter to `init` and is not attached to a client. When capturing or supplementing events, it just uses the currently active scopes.

## Supported Versions

- Python: 3.6+
