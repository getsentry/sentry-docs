---

The Boto3 integration instruments requests made to Amazon Web Services done with [Boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html) (or the low level [botocore](https://github.com/boto/botocore) library that Boto3 uses under the hood). It creates a span for every request.

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI:

```bash
pip install --upgrade 'sentry-sdk'
```

## Configure

If you have the `boto3` package in your dependencies, the Boto3 integration will be enabled automatically when you initialize the Sentry SDK.
