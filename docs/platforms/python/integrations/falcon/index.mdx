The Falcon integration adds support for the [Falcon web framework](https://falconframework.org/).
The integration has been confirmed to work with Falcon 1.4 and 2.0.

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI with the `falcon` extra:

```bash
pip install --upgrade 'sentry-sdk[falcon]'
```

## Configure

If you have the `falcon` package in your dependencies, the Falcon integration will be enabled automatically when you initialize the Sentry SDK.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-config" />

## Verify

```python
import falcon

sentry_sdk.init(...)  # same as above

class HelloWorldResource:
    def on_get(self, req, resp):
        message = {
            'hello': "world",
        }
        1 / 0  # raises an error
        resp.media = message

app = falcon.App()
app.add_route('/', HelloWorldResource())
```

When you point your browser to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) a transaction will be created in the Performance section of [sentry.io](https://sentry.io). Additionally, an error event will be sent to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and will be connected to the transaction.

It takes a couple of moments for the data to appear in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

## Behavior

<Include name="python-uwsgi-warning.mdx" />

- The Sentry Python SDK will install the Falcon integration for all of your apps. The integration hooks into the base `falcon.API` class via monkey patching.

- All exceptions leading to an Internal Server Error are reported.

- Request data is attached to all events: **HTTP method, URL, headers, form data, JSON payloads**. Sentry excludes raw bodies and multipart file uploads. Sentry also excludes personally identifiable information (such as user ids, usernames, cookies, authorization headers, IP addresses) unless you set `send_default_pii` to `True`.

- Each request has a separate scope. Changes to the scope within a view, for example setting a tag, will only apply to events sent as part of the request being handled.

## Options

By adding `FalconIntegration` to your `sentry_sdk.init()` call explicitly, you can set options for `FalconIntegration` to change its behavior:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.falcon import FalconIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    # same as above
    integrations = [
        FalconIntegration(
            transaction_style="path",
        ),
    ],
)
```

You can pass the following keyword arguments to `FalconIntegration()`:

- `transaction_style`:

  ```python
  class MessageResource:
      def on_get(self, req, resp, message_id):
          msg = database.get_message(message_id)
          resp.media = msg.as_json()

  app = falcon.API()
  app.add_route("/message/{message_id}", MessageResource())
  ```

  In the above code, you would set the transaction to:

  - `/myurl/b48a7686-ad8c-4c94-8c3b-412ec7f25db2123` if you set `transaction_style="path"`.
  - `/myurl/{message_id}` if you set `transaction_style="uri_template"`

  The default is `"uri_template"`.

## Supported Versions

- Falcon: 1.4+
- Python: 3.6+
