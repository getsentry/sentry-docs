The [LaunchDarkly](https://launchdarkly.com/) integration tracks feature flag evaluations produced by the LaunchDarkly SDK. These evaluations are held in memory and sent to Sentry for review and analysis if an error occurs. **At the moment, we only support boolean flag evaluations.**

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI with the `launchdarkly` extra.

```bash
pip install --upgrade 'sentry-sdk[launchdarkly]'
```

## Configure

Add `LaunchDarklyIntegration()` to your `integrations` list:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.launchdarkly import LaunchDarklyIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    # Add data like request headers and IP for users, if applicable;
    # see https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/data-management/data-collected/ for more info
    send_default_pii=True,
    integrations=[
        LaunchDarklyIntegration(),
    ],
)
```

## Verify

The integration is tested by evaluating a feature flag using your LaunchDarkly SDK before capturing an exception.

```python
import ldclient
import sentry_sdk

client = ldclient.get()
client.variation("hello", Context.create("test-context"), False)

sentry_sdk.capture_exception(Exception("Something went wrong!"))
```

Visit the Sentry website and confirm that your error event has recorded the feature flag "hello" and its value "false".
