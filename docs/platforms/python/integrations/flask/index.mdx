The Flask integration adds support for the [Flask Web Framework](https://flask.palletsprojects.com).

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI with the `flask` extra:

```bash
pip install --upgrade "sentry-sdk[flask]"
```

## Configure

If you have the `flask` package in your dependencies, the Flask integration will be enabled automatically when you initialize the Sentry SDK.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-config" />

<Note>

Our Python SDK will install the Flask integration for all of your apps. It hooks into Flaskâ€™s signals, not anything on the app object.

</Note>

## Verify

```python
from flask import Flask

sentry_sdk.init(...)  # same as above

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello_world():
    1 / 0  # raises an error
    return "<p>Hello, World!</p>"
```

When you point your browser to [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/) a transaction in the Performance section of [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) will be created. Additionally, an error event will be sent to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and will be connected to the transaction.

It takes a couple of moments for the data to appear in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

## Behavior

<Include name="python-uwsgi-warning.mdx" />

After initialization:

- If you use `flask-login` and set `send_default_pii=True` in your call to `init`, user data (current user id, email address, username) will be attached to the event.
- Request data will be attached to all events: **HTTP method, URL, headers, form data, JSON payloads**. Sentry excludes raw bodies and multipart file uploads.
- Logs emitted by `app.logger` or _any_ logger will be recorded as breadcrumbs by the [Logging](/platforms/python/integrations/logging/) integration (this integration is enabled by default).

## Options

If you add `FlaskIntegration` explicitly to your `sentry_sdk.init()` call you can set options for `FlaskIntegration` to change its behavior:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.flask import FlaskIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    # ...
    integrations = [
        FlaskIntegration(
            transaction_style="url",
            http_methods_to_capture=("GET",),
        ),
    ],
)
```

You can pass the following keyword arguments to `FlaskIntegration()`:

- `transaction_style`:

  Sets the format or style that transactions are named.
  <br/>

  ```python
  @app.route("/myurl/<foo>")
  def myendpoint():
      return "<p>Hello, World!</p>"
  ```

  In the above code, you would set the transaction to:

  - `/myurl/<foo>` if you set `transaction_style="url"`.
  - `myendpoint` if you set `transaction_style="endpoint"`.

  The default is `"endpoint"`.

- `http_methods_to_capture`:

  A tuple containing all the HTTP methods that should create a transaction in Sentry.

  The default is `("CONNECT", "DELETE", "GET", "PATCH", "POST", "PUT", "TRACE",)`.

  (Note that `OPTIONS` and `HEAD` are missing by default.)
