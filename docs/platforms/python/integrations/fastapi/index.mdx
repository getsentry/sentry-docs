The FastAPI integration adds support for the [FastAPI Framework](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI with the `fastapi` extra:

```bash
pip install --upgrade 'sentry-sdk[fastapi]'
```

## Configure

If you have the `fastapi` package in your dependencies, the FastAPI integration will be enabled automatically when you initialize the Sentry SDK.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-config" />

## Verify

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

sentry_sdk.init(...)  # same as above

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/sentry-debug")
async def trigger_error():
    division_by_zero = 1 / 0
```

When you point your browser to [http://localhost:8000/sentry-debug](http://localhost:8000/sentry-debug) a transaction will be created in the Performance section of [sentry.io](https://sentry.io). Additionally, an error event will be sent to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and will be connected to the transaction.

It takes a couple of moments for the data to appear in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

## Behaviour

### Issue Reporting

The following information about your FastAPI project will be available to you on Sentry.io:

- By default, all exceptions leading to an Internal Server Error are captured and reported. The HTTP status codes to report on are configurable via the `failed_request_status_codes` [option](#options).
- Request data such as URL, HTTP method, headers, form data, and JSON payloads is attached to all issues.
- Sentry excludes raw bodies and multipart file uploads.
- Sentry also excludes personally identifiable information (such as user ids, usernames, cookies, authorization headers, IP addresses) unless you set `send_default_pii` to `True`.

### Monitor Performance

The following parts of your FastAPI project are monitored:

- Middleware stack
- Middleware `send` and `receive` callbacks
- Database queries
- Redis commands

<Note>

The parameter `enable_tracing` needs to be set when initializing the Sentry SDK for performance measurements to be recorded.

## Options

By adding `FastApiIntegration` to your `sentry_sdk.init()` call explicitly, you can set options for `FastApiIntegration` to change its behavior.
Because FastAPI is based on the Starlette framework, both integrations, `StarletteIntegration` and `FastApiIntegration`, must be instantiated.

```python
from sentry_sdk.integrations.starlette import StarletteIntegration
from sentry_sdk.integrations.fastapi import FastApiIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    # same as above
    integrations=[
        StarletteIntegration(
            transaction_style="endpoint",
            failed_request_status_codes=[403, range(500, 599)],
        ),
        FastApiIntegration(
            transaction_style="endpoint",
            failed_request_status_codes=[403, range(500, 599)],
        ),
    ]
)
```

You can pass the following keyword arguments to `StarletteIntegration()` and `FastApiIntegration()`:

- `transaction_style`:

  This option lets you influence how the transactions are named in Sentry. For example:

  ```python
  import sentry_sdk
  from sentry_sdk.integrations.starlette import StarletteIntegration
  from sentry_sdk.integrations.fastapi import FastApiIntegration

  sentry_sdk.init(
      # ...
      integrations=[
          StarletteIntegration(
              transaction_style="endpoint"
          ),
          FastApiIntegration(
              transaction_style="endpoint"
          ),
      ],
  )

  app = FastAPI()

  @app.get("/catalog/product/{product_id}")
  async def product_detail(product_id):
      return {...}
  ```

  In the above code, the transaction name will be:

  - `"/catalog/product/{product_id}"` if you set `transaction_style="url"`
  - `"product_detail"` if you set `transaction_style="endpoint"`

  The default is `"url"`.

- `failed_request_status_codes`:

  A list of integers or containers (objects that allow membership checks via `in`)
  of integers that will determine which status codes should be reported to Sentry.

  Examples of valid `failed_request_status_codes`:

  - `[500]` will only send events on HTTP 500.
  - `[400, range(500, 599)]` will send events on HTTP 400 as well as the 500-599 range.
  - `[500, 503]` will send events on HTTP 500 and 503.

  The default is `[range(500, 599)]`.
