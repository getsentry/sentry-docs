The Starlite integration adds support for the [Starlite framework](https://docs.litestar.dev/1/).

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI with the `starlite` extra:

```bash
pip install --upgrade 'sentry-sdk[starlite]' uvicorn
```

## Configure

If you have the `starlite` package in your dependencies, the Starlite integration will be enabled automatically when you initialize the Sentry SDK.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-config" />

## Verify

```python
from starlite import Starlite, get

sentry_sdk.init(...)  # same as above

@get("/hello")
async def hello_world() -> str:
    1 / 0
    return "Hello!"

app = Starlite(route_handlers=[hello_world])
```

Save the file above as `app.py` and start the development server with:

```bash
uvicorn app:app
```

When you point your browser to [http://localhost:8000/hello](http://localhost:8000/hello) a transaction will be created in the Performance section of [sentry.io](https://sentry.io). Additionally, the `ZeroDivisionError` we've snuck into our `hello_world` handler will be sent to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and will be connected to the transaction.

It takes a couple of moments for the data to appear in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).
