`RustTracingIntegration` acts as a bridge between the Sentry Python SDK and Rust's [`tracing` framework](https://tracing.rs/). With this integration, traces that begin in Python can extend into Rust seamlessly.

<Alert level="warning">

This integration assumes that your Rust native extension runs synchronously on the current thread. Emitting tracing data from other threads or Rust code that uses `async`/`.await` may corrupt the current trace.

</Alert>

## Install

`RustTracingIntegration` requires setup in both Python and Rust to work.

### Rust
In your Rust native extension, you'll need three crates as dependencies in `Cargo.toml`:
- [`tracing-subscriber`](https://crates.io/crates/tracing_subscriber)
- [`pyo3`](https://crates.io/crates/pyo3)
- [`pyo3-python-tracing-subscriber`](https://crates.io/crates/pyo3_python_tracing_subscriber)

### Python
In your Python project, you'll need to install the Sentry SDK from PyPI.
```bash
pip install --upgrade sentry-sdk
```

## Configure

As with installing, configuring `RustTracingIntegration` requires some work in both Python and Rust.

### Rust

In your Rust native extension, you need to expose a way for `RustTracingIntegration` to subscribe to `tracing` updates. A simple setup may look like this:
```rust
#[pyfunction]
pub fn initialize_tracing(py_impl: Bound<'_, PyAny>) {
    tracing_subscriber::registry()
        .with(pyo3_python_tracing_subscriber::PythonCallbackLayerBridge::new(py_impl))
        .init();
}

#[pymodule]
fn my_rust_extension(m: &Bound<'_, PyModule>) -> PyResult<()> {
    m.add_function(wrap_pyfunction!(initialize_tracing, m)?)?;

    Ok(())
}
```

### Python

Create an instance of `RustTracingIntegration` and add it to your list of integrations when initializing the Sentry SDK.

<OnboardingOptionButtons
  options={[
    'error-monitoring',
    'performance',
    'profiling',
  ]}
/>

```python {filename:main.py} {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "12-14", "profiling": "15-18"}}
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.rust_tracing import RustTracingIntegration

import my_rust_extension

async def main():
    sentry_sdk.init(
        dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
        # Add data like request headers and IP for users, if applicable;
        # see https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/data-management/data-collected/ for more info
        send_default_pii=True,
        # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
        # of transactions for tracing.
        traces_sample_rate=1.0,
        # Set profiles_sample_rate to 1.0 to profile 100%
        # of sampled transactions.
        # We recommend adjusting this value in production.
        profiles_sample_rate=1.0,
        integrations=[
            RustTracingIntegration(
                "my_rust_extension",
                my_rust_extension.initialize_tracing,
                include_tracing_fields=True,
            ),
        ],
    )

    # your code goes here.
    ...

asyncio.run(main())
```


## Verify

A simple way to check if the integration is hooked up correctly is to set a custom `event_type_mapping` and `span_filter` that prints or logs `tracing` event metadata and then call a Python function that uses your Rust native extension.
```python
from sentry_sdk.integrations.rust_tracing import (
    default_event_type_mapping,
    default_span_filter,
    EventTypeMapping,
    RustTracingIntegration,
)

import my_rust_extension

def custom_event_type_mapping(metadata: dict) -> EventTypeMapping:
    print(metadata)
    return default_event_type_mapping(metadata)

def custom_span_filter(metadata: dict) -> bool:
    print(metadata)
    return default_span_filter(metadata)

sentry_sdk.init(
    # ...
    integrations=[
        RustTracingIntegration(
            "my_rust_extension",
            my_rust_extension.initialize_tracing,
            event_type_mapping=custom_event_type_mapping,
            span_filter=custom_span_filter,
        ),
    ],
)
```

To see the results on [sentry.io](https://sentry.io), go to the Traces section for your project and search for a Python span that calls a function from your Rust native extension. If the integration is working and the Rust function is instrumented with the Rust `tracing` framework, then the Python span will have a Rust child, and the Rust child may have a whole tree of Rust spans beneath it.

The `pyo3-python-tracing-subscriber` crate has [a working example of a Sentry integration](https://github.com/getsentry/pyo3-python-tracing-subscriber/tree/main/demo).

## Options

`RustTracingIntegration` accepts a few arguments:
- `identifier` (required)

  A unique identifier for this native extension. If your project uses more than one Rust native extension, each of them needs its own `RustTracingIntegration`.

- `initializer` (required)

  A function from your native extension that `RustTracingIntegration` can call to subscribe to `tracing` events.

  See the `initialize_tracing` example in [the _Configure_ section above](#configure)

- `event_type_mapping` (optional)

  A function that decides what type of Sentry event to create for a given `tracing` event.

  It takes a single argument: a dictionary containing data from [`tracing::Metadata`](https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/struct.Metadata.html).

  It returns a `sentry_sdk.integrations.rust_tracing.EventTypeMapping`.

  Uses `sentry_sdk.integrations.rust_tracing.default_event_type_mapping` by default.

- `span_filter` (optional)

  A function that decides whether to drop a given `tracing` span.

  It takes a single argument: a dictionary containing data from [`tracing::Metadata`](https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/struct.Metadata.html).

  It returns `True` if a span should be processed and `False` if it should be dropped.

  Uses `sentry_sdk.integrations.rust_tracing.default_span_filter` by default.

- `include_tracing_fields` (optional)

  A boolean controlling whether the values of a `tracing` span's key-value fields will be attached to the corresponding Sentry span.

  If it is `None`, this behavior will be controlled by <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#send-default-pii">the `send_default_pii` option</PlatformLink> set during SDK initialization. If it is `False`, field values will be redacted on Sentry spans. If it is `True`, field values will be included on Sentry spans.

  The default value of this option is `None`.

  <Alert level="warning">

  When the `tracing::instrument` attribute is applied to a Rust function, `tracing` will set all of the function's arguments as span fields by default. This behavior can cause a function argument that contains sensitive data to unintentionally be sent to Sentry. To avoid that, `include_tracing_fields` by default will defer to the <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#send-default-pii">`send_default_pii`</PlatformLink> option which can be set during SDK initialization.

  If you want to set `include_tracing_fields` or <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#send-default-pii">`send_default_pii`</PlatformLink> to `True`, see our documentation for <PlatformLink to="/data-management/sensitive-data/">managing sensitive data</PlatformLink> for ways to keep sensitive data from leaking.
