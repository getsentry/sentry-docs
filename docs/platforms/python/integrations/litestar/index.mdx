The Litestar integration adds support for the [Litestar framework](https://docs.litestar.dev/2/).

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI with the `litestar` extra:

```bash
pip install --upgrade 'sentry-sdk[litestar]' uvicorn
```

## Configure

Add `LitestarIntegration()` to your `integrations` list:


<OnboardingOptionButtons
  options={[
    'error-monitoring',
    'performance',
    'profiling',
  ]}
/>

```python {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "6-8", "profiling": "9-12"}}
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.litestar import LitestarIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for tracing.
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
    # Set profiles_sample_rate to 1.0 to profile 100%
    # of sampled transactions.
    # We recommend adjusting this value in production.
    profiles_sample_rate=1.0,
    integrations=[
        LitestarIntegration(),
    ],
)
```

## Verify

```python
from litestar import Litestar, get

sentry_sdk.init(...)  # same as above

@get("/hello")
async def hello_world() -> str:
    1 / 0
    return "Hello!"

app = Litestar(route_handlers=[hello_world])
```

Save the file above as `app.py` and start the development server with:

```bash
uvicorn app:app
```

When you point your browser to [http://localhost:8000/hello](http://localhost:8000/hello) a transaction will be created in the Performance section of [sentry.io](https://sentry.io). Additionally, the `ZeroDivisionError` we've snuck into our `hello_world` handler will be sent to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and will be connected to the transaction.

It takes a couple of moments for the data to appear in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).
