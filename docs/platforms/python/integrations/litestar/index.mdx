The Litestar integration adds support for the [Litestar framework](https://docs.litestar.dev/2/).

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI with the `litestar` extra:

```bash
pip install --upgrade 'sentry-sdk[litestar]' uvicorn
```

## Configure

Add `LitestarIntegration()` to your `integrations` list:


<OnboardingOptionButtons
  options={[
    'error-monitoring',
    'performance',
    'profiling',
  ]}
/>

```python {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "9-11", "profiling": "12-15"}}
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.litestar import LitestarIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    # Add data like request headers and IP for users, if applicable;
    # see https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/data-management/data-collected/ for more info
    send_default_pii=True,
    # Set traces_sample_rate to 1.0 to capture 100%
    # of transactions for tracing.
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
    # Set profiles_sample_rate to 1.0 to profile 100%
    # of sampled transactions.
    # We recommend adjusting this value in production.
    profiles_sample_rate=1.0,
    integrations=[
        LitestarIntegration(),
    ],
)
```

## Verify

```python
from litestar import Litestar, get

sentry_sdk.init(...)  # same as above

@get("/hello")
async def hello_world() -> str:
    1 / 0
    return "Hello!"

app = Litestar(route_handlers=[hello_world])
```

Save the file above as `app.py` and start the development server with:

```bash
uvicorn app:app
```

When you point your browser to [http://localhost:8000/hello](http://localhost:8000/hello) a transaction will be created in the Performance section of [sentry.io](https://sentry.io). Additionally, the `ZeroDivisionError` we've snuck into our `hello_world` handler will be sent to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and will be connected to the transaction.

It takes a couple of moments for the data to appear in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

## Options

By adding `LitestarIntegration` to your `sentry_sdk.init()` call explicitly, you can set options for `LitestarIntegration` to change its behavior:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.litestar import LitestarIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    # ...
    integrations=[
        LitestarIntegration(
            failed_request_status_codes={403, *range(500, 599)},
        ),
    ],
)
```

You can pass the following keyword arguments to `LitestarIntegration()`:

### `failed_request_status_codes`

A `set` of integers that will determine when an `HTTPException` should be reported to Sentry. The `HTTPException` is reported to Sentry if its status code is contained in the `failed_request_status_codes` set.

Examples of valid `failed_request_status_codes`:

- `{500}` will only report `HTTPException` with status 500.
- `{400, *range(500, 600)}` will report `HTTPException` with status 400 as well as those in the 5xx range.
- `set()` (the empty set) will not report any `HTTPException` to Sentry.

The default is `{*range(500, 600)}`, meaning that any `HTTPException` with a status in the 5xx range is reported to Sentry.

Regardless of how `failed_request_status_codes` is set, any exceptions raised by the handler, which are not of type `HTTPException` (or a subclass) are reported to Sentry. For example, if your request handler raises an unhandled `AttributeError`, the `AttributeError` gets reported to Sentry, even if you have set `failed_request_status_codes=set()`.

## Supported Versions

<Alert level="warning" title="Note">

Litestar was [renamed from Starlite](https://litestar.dev/about/organization.html#litestar-and-starlite)
with the release of version 2.0. We support different integrations for each one. This guide applies to Litestar.
See [Starlite integration](/platforms/python/integrations/starlite) for the guide that applies to Starlite.

</Alert>
