<Alert level="info" title="Beta">

The support for **Anthropic** is in its beta phase.

We are working on supporting different AI libraries (see [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/discussions/3007)).

If you want to try the beta features and are willing to give feedback, please let us know on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Ww9hbqr).

</Alert>


This integration connects Sentry with the [Anthropic Python SDK](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python) and works with Anthropic versions `0.16.0` and above.

Once you've installed this SDK, you can use Sentry LLM Monitoring, a Sentry dashboard that helps you understand what's going on with your AI pipelines.

Sentry LLM Monitoring will automatically collect information about prompts, tokens, and models from providers like OpenAI. Learn more about it [here](/product/llm-monitoring).

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI with the `anthropic` extra:

```bash
pip install --upgrade 'sentry-sdk[anthropic]'
```

## Configure

If you have the `anthropic` package in your dependencies, the Anthropic integration will be enabled automatically when you initialize the Sentry SDK.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-config" />

## Verify

Verify that the integration works by creating an AI pipeline. The resulting data should show up in your LLM monitoring dashboard.

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.ai.monitoring import ai_track
from anthropic import Anthropic


sentry_sdk.init(...)  # same as above

client = Anthropic(api_key="(your Anthropic API key)")

@ai_track("My AI pipeline")
def my_pipeline():
    with sentry_sdk.start_transaction(op="ai-inference", name="The result of the AI inference"):
        print(
            client.messages.create(
                max_tokens=42,
                model="some-model",
                messages=[{"role": "system", "content": "Hello, Anthropic!"}]
            )
        )
```

After running this script, a pipeline will be created in the [LLM Monitoring](/product/llm-monitoring) section of the Sentry dashboard.

The pipeline will have an associated Anthropic span for the `messages.create` operation.

It may take a couple of moments for the data to appear in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

## Behavior

- The supported modules are currently `chat.messages.create` with `stream=True` and `stream=False`.

- All exceptions leading to an `AnthropicError` are reported.

- Sentry considers LLM and tokenizer inputs/outputs as PII and doesn't include PII data by default. If you want to include the data, set `send_default_pii=True` in the `sentry_sdk.init()` call. To explicitly exclude prompts and outputs despite `send_default_pii=True`, configure the integration with `include_prompts=False` as shown in the [Options section](#options) below.

## Options

The `AnthropicIntegration` takes an optional `include_prompts` parameter. If set to `False`, prompts are excluded from being sent to Sentry, despite `send_default_pii=True`.

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.anthropic import AnthropicIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    # same options as above
    send_default_pii=True,
    integrations=[
        AnthropicIntegration(
            include_prompts=False, # Exclude prompts from being sent to Sentry, despite send_default_pii=True
        ),
    ],
)
```

## Supported Versions

- Anthropic: 0.16.0+
- Python: 3.7+
