This integration connects Sentry with the [Anthropic Python SDK](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python).

Once you've installed this SDK, you can use Sentry AI Agents Monitoring, a Sentry dashboard that helps you understand what's going on with your AI requests.

Sentry AI Monitoring will automatically collect information about prompts, tools, tokens, and models. Learn more about the [AI Agents Dashboard](/product/insights/ai/agents).

## Install

Install `sentry-sdk` from PyPI with the `anthropic` extra:

```bash {tabTitle:pip}
pip install "sentry-sdk[anthropic]"
```

```bash {tabTitle:uv}
uv add "sentry-sdk[anthropic]"
```

## Configure

If you have the `anthropic` package in your dependencies, the Anthropic integration will be enabled automatically when you initialize the Sentry SDK.

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-config" />

## Verify

Verify that the integration works by making a chat request to Anthropic.

```python
import sentry_sdk
from anthropic import Anthropic

sentry_sdk.init(...)  # same as above

client = Anthropic(api_key="(your Anthropic key)")

def my_llm_stuff():
    with sentry_sdk.start_transaction(name="The result of the AI inference"):
        print(
            client.messages.create(
                model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620",
                max_tokens=1024,
                messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "say hello"}]
            )
            .content[0]
            .text
        )
```

After running this script, the resulting data should show up in the `"AI Spans"` tab on the `"Explore" > "Traces" > "Trace"` page on Sentry.io.

If you manually created an <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation/ai-agents-module/#invoke-agent-span">Invoke Agent Span</PlatformLink> (not done in the example above) the data will also show up in the [AI Agents Dashboard](/product/insights/ai/agents).

It may take a couple of moments for the data to appear in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).

## Behavior

- The Anthropic integration will connect Sentry with the supported Anthropic methods automatically.

- The supported function is currently `messages.create` (both sync and async).

- Sentry considers LLM inputs/outputs as PII (Personally identifiable information) and doesn't include PII data by default. If you want to include the data, set `send_default_pii=True` in the `sentry_sdk.init()` call. To explicitly exclude prompts and outputs despite `send_default_pii=True`, configure the integration with `include_prompts=False` as shown in the [Options section](#options) below.

## Options

By adding `AnthropicIntegration` to your `sentry_sdk.init()` call explicitly, you can set options for `AnthropicIntegration` to change its behavior:

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.anthropic import AnthropicIntegration

sentry_sdk.init(
    # ...
    # Add data like inputs and responses;
    # see https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/data-management/data-collected/ for more info
    send_default_pii=True,
    integrations=[
        AnthropicIntegration(
            include_prompts=False,  # LLM inputs/outputs will be not sent to Sentry, despite send_default_pii=True
        ),
    ],
)
```

You can pass the following keyword arguments to `AnthropicIntegration()`:

- `include_prompts`:

  Whether LLM inputs and outputs should be sent to Sentry. Sentry considers this data personal identifiable data (PII) by default. If you want to include the data, set `send_default_pii=True` in the `sentry_sdk.init()` call. To explicitly exclude prompts and outputs despite `send_default_pii=True`, configure the integration with `include_prompts=False`.

  The default is `True`.

## Supported Versions

- Anthropic: 0.16.0+
- Python: 3.8+
