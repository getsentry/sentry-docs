description: With Feature Flags, Sentry tracks feature flag evaluations in your application, keeps an audit log of feature flag changes, and reports any suspicious updates that may have caused an error.

## Prerequisites

* You have the <PlatformLink to="/">Python SDK installed</PlatformLink>.

## Enable Evaluation Tracking

If you use a third-party SDK to evaluate feature flags, you can enable a Sentry SDK integration to track those evaluations. Integrations are provider specific. Documentation for supported SDKs is listed below.

- [LaunchDarkly](/platforms/python/integrations/launchdarkly/)
- [OpenFeature](/platforms/python/integrations/openfeature/)
- [Statsig](/platforms/python/integrations/statsig/)
- [Unleash](/platforms/python/integrations/unleash/)

### Generic API
The generic API allows you to manually track feature flag evaluations. These
evaluations are held in memory, and in the event an error occurs, sent to
Sentry for review and analysis. Specifically, the generic integration enables
users to integrate with proprietary (or otherwise unsupported) feature flagging
solutions.  **At the moment, we only support boolean flag evaluations.**

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.feature_flags import add_feature_flag

add_feature_flag('test-flag', False)  # Records an evaluation and its result.

sentry_sdk.capture_exception(Exception("Something went wrong!"))
```

Go to your Sentry project and confirm that your error event has recorded the feature flag "test-flag" and its value "false".
