## Prerequisites

* You have the <PlatformLink to="/">Python SDK installed</PlatformLink>.

## Enable Evaluation Tracking

Evaluation tracking requires enabling an SDK integration. Integrations are provider specific. Documentation for supported providers is listed below.

- [OpenFeature](/platforms/python/integrations/openfeature/)
- [LaunchDarkly](/platforms/python/integrations/launchdarkly/)
- [Manual Tracking](/platforms/python/integrations/feature_flags/) - if you use an unsupported or in-house provider, you may track evaluations through an API.
