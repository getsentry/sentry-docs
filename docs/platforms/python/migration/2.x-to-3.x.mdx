<Alert title="Python SDK 3.0 pre-release">

Version 3.0 of the Sentry Python SDK is currently in pre-release. If you feel like giving it a spin, check out [our most recent releases](https://pypi.org/project/sentry-sdk/#history). Your feedback at this stage is invaluable, so please let us know about your experience, whether positive or negative, [on GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/discussions/3936) or [on Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Ww9hbqr): How did the migration go? Did you encounter any issues? Is everything working as expected?

</Alert>

This guide describes the common patterns involved in migrating to version `3.x` of the `sentry-python` SDK. For the full list of changes, check out the [detailed migration guide in the repository](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/blob/potel-base/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md).


## Python Version Support

Sentry Python SDK `3.x` only supports Python 3.7 and higher. If you're on an older Python version, you'll need to stay on an older version of the SDK:

- Python 2.7-3.5: SDK `1.x`
- Python 3.6: SDK `2.x`


## Configuration

The `enable_tracing` option was removed. Use [`traces_sample_rate`](/platforms/python/configuration/options/#traces_sample_rate) directly, or configure a [`traces_sampler`](/platforms/python/configuration/options/#traces_sampler) for more fine-grained control over which spans should be sampled.

```python diff
  sentry_sdk.init(
-     enable_tracing=True,
+     traces_sample_rate=1.0,
  )
```

The deprecated `propagate_traces` option was removed. Use [`trace_propagation_targets`](/platforms/python/configuration/options/#trace_propagation_targets) instead.

```python diff
  sentry_sdk.init(
      # don't propagate trace info downstream
-     propagate_traces=False,
+     trace_propagation_targets=[],
  )
```

Note that this only affects the global SDK option. The [`propagate_traces`](/platforms/python/integrations/celery/#options) option of the Celery integration remains unchanged.

The `profiles_sample_rate` and `profiler_mode` options previously nested under `_experiments` have been removed. They're replaced by top-level options of the same name:

```python diff
  sentry_sdk.init(
-     _experiments={
-         "profiles_sample_rate": 1.0,
-         "profiler_mode": "thread",
-     },
+     profiles_sample_rate=1.0,
+     profiler_mode="thread",
  )
```

## API Changes

`add_attachment()` is now a part of the top-level level API and should be imported and used directly from `sentry_sdk`.

```python diff
  import sentry_sdk

- scope = sentry_sdk.get_current_scope()
- scope.add_attachment(bytes=b"Hello World!", filename="attachment.txt")
+ sentry_sdk.add_attachment(bytes=b"Hello World!", filename="attachment.txt")
```

Using `sentry_sdk.add_attachment()` directly also makes sure the attachment is added to the correct scope internally.

### Tracing

Tracing in the Sentry Python SDK `3.x` is powered by [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) in the background, which also means we're moving away from the Sentry-specific concept of transactions and towards a span-only future. `sentry_sdk.start_transaction()` is now deprecated in favor of `sentry_sdk.start_span()`.

```python diff
- with sentry_sdk.start_transaction():
+ with sentry_sdk.start_span():
      ...
```

If you start a span, it will automatically become the child of the currently active span. If you want to create a span that should instead start its own trace, use the `new_trace()` context manager.

```python
with sentry_sdk.start_span(name="parent"):
    with sentry_sdk.start_span(name="child-of-parent"):    
        with sentry_sdk.new_trace():
            # The first span started in this context manager will become
            # a new transaction (root span) with its own trace
            with sentry_sdk.start_span(name="new-parent"):
                with sentry_sdk.start_span(name="child-of-new-parent"):
                    ...
```

Any spans without a parent span will become transactions by default. If you want to avoid promoting a span without a parent to a transaction, you can pass the `only_if_parent=True` keyword argument to `sentry_sdk.start_span()`.

`sentry_sdk.start_transaction()` and `sentry_sdk.start_span()` no longer take the following arguments: `trace_id`, `baggage`, `span_id`, `parent_span_id`, `custom_sampling_context` (see below). Use `sentry_sdk.continue_trace()` for propagating trace data.

`sentry_sdk.continue_trace()` no longer returns a `Transaction` and is now a context manager. To continue a trace from headers or environment variables, start a new span inside `sentry_sdk.continue_trace()`:

```python diff
- transaction = sentry_sdk.continue_trace({...})
- with sentry_sdk.start_transaction(transaction=transaction):
-     ...
+ with sentry_sdk.continue_trace({...}):
+     with sentry_sdk.start_span():
+         ...
```

The functions `continue_from_headers`, `continue_from_environ` and `from_traceparent` have been removed. Use the `sentry_sdk.continue_trace()` context manager instead.


## Span Data

In OpenTelemetry, there is no concept of separate categories of data on a span: everything is simply a span attribute. This is a concept the Sentry SDK is also adopting. We deprecated `set_data()` and added a new span method called `set_attribute()`:

```python diff
  with sentry_sdk.start_span(...) as span:
-      span.set_data("my_attribute", "my_value")
+      span.set_attribute("my_attribute", "my_value")
```

You can also set attributes directly when creating the span. This has the advantage that these initial attributes will be accessible in the sampling context in your `traces_sampler`/`profiles_sampler` (see also the [Sampling section](#sampling)).

```python
with sentry_sdk.start_span(attributes={"my_attribute": "my_value"}):
    ...
```

<Alert title="Span attribute type restrictions" level="warning">

There are important type restrictions to consider when setting attributes on a span via `span.set_attribute()` and `start_span(attributes={...})`. The keys must be non-empty strings and the values can only be several primitive types (excluding `None`) or a list of a single primitive type. See [the OpenTelemetry specification](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/common/#attribute) for details.

Note that since the SDK is now exclusively using span attributes, this restriction applies to other ways of setting data on a span as well like `span.set_data()`, `span.set_measurement()`, `span.set_context()`.

</Alert>


## Sampling

It's no longer possible to change the sampling decision of a span by setting `span.sampled` directly after the span has been created. Use either a custom `traces_sampler` (preferred) or the `sampled` argument to `start_span()` for determining whether a span should be sampled.

```python
with sentry_sdk.start_span(sampled=True) as span:
    ...
```

<Alert title="Sampling non-root spans" level="warning">

Both `traces_sampler` and the `sampled` argument will only influence whether root spans (transactions) are sampled. They can't be used for sampling child spans.

</Alert>

The `sampling_context` argument of `traces_sampler` and `profiles_sampler` has changed considerably for spans coming from our auto-instrumented integrations. As a consequence of using OpenTelemetry under the hood, spans can only carry specific, primitive types of data. This prevents us from making custom objects, for example, the `Request` object for several web frameworks, accessible on the span.

<Expandable title='AIOHTTP sampling context changes'>
  The AIOHTTP integration doesn't add the `aiohttp_request` object anymore. Instead, some of the individual properties of the request are accessible, if available, as follows:

</Expandable>

The ability to set `custom_sampling_context` on `start_transaction` was removed. If there is custom data that you want to have accessible in the `sampling_context` of a `traces_sampler` or `profiles_sampler`, set it on the span via the `attributes` argument, as all span attributes are now included in the `sampling_context` by default:

```python diff
- with start_transaction(custom_sampling_context={"custom_attribute": "custom_value"}):
+ with start_span(attributes={"custom_attribute": "custom_value"}) as span:
      # custom_attribute will now be accessible in the sampling context
      # of your traces_sampler/profiles_sampler
      ...
```

<Alert title="Span attribute type restrictions" level="warning">

As mentioned above, span attribute keys must be non-empty strings and values can only be several primitive types (excluding `None`) or a list of a single primitive type. See [the OpenTelemetry specification](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/common/#attribute) for details.

</Alert>


## Errors

We've updated how we handle `ExceptionGroup`s. You will now get more data if `ExceptionGroup`s appear in chained exceptions. As an indirect consequence, you might notice a change in how issues are grouped in Sentry.


## Integrations

Additional integrations will now be activated automatically if the SDK detects the respective package is installed: Ariadne, ARQ, asyncpg, Chalice, clickhouse-driver, GQL, Graphene, huey, Loguru, PyMongo, Quart, Starlite, Strawberry. You can [opt-out of specific integrations with the `disabled_integrations` option](/platforms/python/integrations/#disabling-integrations).

We no longer support Django older than 2.0, trytond older than 5.0, and Falcon older than 3.0.

### Logging

The logging integration, which implements out-of-the-box support for the Python standard library `logging` framework, doesn't capture error logs as events anymore by default. The original behavior can still be achieved by providing a custom `event_level` to the `LoggingIntegration`:

```python
sentry_sdk.init(
    integrations=[
        # capture error, critical, exception logs
        # and send them to Sentry as errors
        LoggingIntegration(event_level="ERROR"),
    ],
)
```

### Threading

The parameter `propagate_hub` has been removed from `ThreadingIntegration`. Use the new `propagate_scope` parameter instead. (If you had `ThreadingIntegration(propagate_hub=True)`, you can remove the parameter.)


### clickhouse-driver

The query being executed is now available under the `db.query.text` span attribute (only if `send_default_pii` is `True`).

### PyMongo

The PyMongo integration no longer sets tags automatically. The data is still accessible via span attributes.

The PyMongo integration doesn't set `operation_ids` anymore. The individual IDs (`operation_id`, `request_id`, `session_id`) are now accessible as separate span attributes.

### Redis

In Redis pipeline spans, there is no `span["data"]["redis.commands"]` that contains a dictionary `{"count": 3, "first_ten": ["cmd1", "cmd2", ...]}`. Instead, there is `span["data"]["redis.commands.count"]` (containing `3`) and `span["data"]["redis.commands.first_ten"]` (containing `["cmd1", "cmd2", ...]`).


## Measurements

The `set_measurement()` API was removed. You can set custom attributes on the span instead with `set_attribute()`.


## Sessions

The `auto_session_tracking()` context manager was removed. Use `track_session()` instead.


## Scope

Setting `Scope.user` directly is no longer supported. Use `Scope.set_user()` instead.


## Metrics

The `sentry_sdk.metrics` API doesn't exist anymore in SDK `3.x` as the [metrics beta has come to an end](https://sentry.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/26369339769883-Metrics-Beta-Coming-to-an-End). The associated experimental options `enable_metrics`, `before_emit_metric` and `metric_code_locations` have been removed as well.


## Internals

There is no concept of a hub anymore and all APIs and attributes that were connected to hubs have been removed.
