<Note>

There is no stable 2.0 release of the Sentry Python SDK yet. An alpha version (`2.0.0a1`) is available for testing. If you decide to give it a try, please [let us know](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/issues) if you run into any issues!

</Note>


If you want to move to version 2.x of the `sentry-python` SDK, we provide a short guide here of the most common patterns.

While the top level API stays the same for the most part, there's a number of deprecations and breaking changes in 2.0. Here's a selection that we think might affect the most people; for the full list of changes check out the [detailed migration guide in the repository](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/blob/sentry-sdk-2.0/MIGRATION_GUIDE.md).

## Configuration options

The `profiles_sample_rate` and `profiler_mode` options are not experimental anymore and can be used directly. Setting them via `_experiments` is deprecated and will be removed in the future.

The deprecated `with_locals` and `request_bodies` options have been removed in favor of their new counterparts: `include_local_variables` and `max_request_body_size`, respectively.

**Old**:

<SignInNote />

```python
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    with_locals=False,
    request_bodies="always",
    _experiments={
        "profiles_sample_rate": 1.0,
        "profiler_mode": "thread",
    },
)
```

**New**:

<SignInNote />

```python
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    include_local_variables=False,  # replaces with_locals
    max_request_body_size="always",  # replaces request_bodies
    profiles_sample_rate=1.0,  # replaces _experiments["profiles_sample_rate"]
    profiler_mode="thread",  # replaces _experiments["profiler_mode"]
)
```

## Python version support

Sentry Python SDK 2.0 now only supports Python 3.6 and higher. If you're on Python 2.7 or 3.5 and lower, you'll need to stay on 1.x.

## API

The deprecated top level API function `last_event_id()` was removed. The last event ID is still returned by `capture_event()`, `capture_exception()` and `capture_message()`.

## Custom instrumentation

If you create a transaction manually and later mutate the transaction in a `configure_scope` block this does not work anymore. Here is a recipe on how to change your code to make it work:

**Old**:

<SignInNote />

```python
transaction = sentry_sdk.transaction(...)

# later in the code execution:

with sentry_sdk.configure_scope() as scope:
    scope.set_transaction_name("new-transaction-name")
```

**New**:

<SignInNote />

```python
transaction = sentry_sdk.transaction(...)

# later in the code execution:

scope = sentry_sdk.Scope.get_current_scope()
scope.set_transaction_name("new-transaction-name")
```

## Transport

Sentry Python 2.0 is now only compatible with self-hosted Sentry `v20.6.0` and above, since the SDK now sends all events to the `/envelope` API endpoint. Self-hosted Sentry users must upgrade their self-hosted instance to a compatible version. No action is needed for SaaS users and self-hosted users already running a compatible Sentry version.

If you're using a custom transport, `sentry_sdk.transport.Transport.capture_event` has been deprecated. Use `sentry_sdk.transport.Transport.capture_envelope` instead. Additionally, custom transports should now all be implemented as `sentry_sdk.transport.Transport` subclasses, since transport functions are deprecated.
