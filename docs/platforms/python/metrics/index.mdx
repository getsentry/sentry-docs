<Alert>

This feature is currently in open beta. Please reach out on [GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/discussions/5042) if you have feedback or questions. Features in beta are still in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.

</Alert>

Sentry metrics help you pinpoint and solve issues that impact user experience and app performance by measuring the data points that are important to you. You can track things like processing time, event size, user signups, and conversion rates, then correlate them back to tracing data in order to get deeper insights and solve issues faster.

Once in Sentry, these metrics can be viewed alongside relevant errors, and searched using their individual attributes.
