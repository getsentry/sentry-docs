<Note>

Metrics for Python are supported with Sentry Python SDK version `1.40.0` and above.

</Note>

Sentry metrics help you pinpoint and solve issues that impact user experience and app performance by measuring the data points that are important to you. You can track things like processing time, event size, user signups, and conversion rates, then correlate them back to tracing data in order to get deeper insights and solve issues faster.

## Configure Metrics

Metrics is supported out of the box, so you don't need to do anything to enable it. There are some experimental [options](#options) you can use to influence metrics behavior.


## Emit a Counter

Counters are one of the more basic types of metrics and can be used to count certain event occurrences.

To emit a counter, do the following:

```python
# Increment a counter by one for each button click.
sentry_sdk.metrics.incr(
	key="button_click",
	value=1,
	tags={
		"browser": "Firefox",
		"app_version": "1.0.0"
	}
)
```

## Emit a Distribution

Distributions help you get the most insights from your data by allowing you to obtain aggregations such as `p90`, `min`, `max`, and `avg`.

To emit a distribution, do the following:

```python
# Add '15.0' to a distribution used for tracking the loading times per page.
sentry_sdk.metrics.distribution(
	key="page_load",
	value=15.0,
	unit="millisecond",
	tags={
		"page": "/home"
	}
)
```

Sentry supports arbitrary custom values for `unit`, but we recommend using one of the [supported units listed below](./#supported-metric-units).

## Emit a Set

Sets are useful for looking at unique occurrences and counting the unique elements you added.

To emit a set, do the following:

```python
# Add 'jane' to a set used for tracking the number of users that viewed a page.
sentry_sdk.metrics.set(
	key="user_view",
	value="jane",
	unit="username",
	tags={
		"page": "/home"
	}
)
```

Sentry supports arbitrary custom values for `unit`, but we recommend using one of the [supported units listed below](./#supported-metric-units).


## Emit a Gauge

Gauges let you obtain aggregates like `min`, `max`, `avg`, `sum`, and `count`. They can be represented in a more space-efficient way than distributions, but they can't be used to get percentiles. If percentiles aren't important to you, we recommend using gauges.

To emit a gauge, do the following:

```python
# Add '15.0' to a gauge used for tracking the loading times for a page.
sentry_sdk.metrics.gauge(
	key="page_load",
	value=15.0,
	unit="millisecond",
	tags={
		"page": "/home"
	}
)
```

Sentry supports arbitrary custom values for `unit`, but we recommend using one of the [supported units listed below](./#supported-metric-units).


## Emit a Timer

Timers can be used to measure the execution time of a specific block of code. They're implemented like distributions, but measured in seconds.

To emit a timer, do the following:

```python
# Measure the time of execution of the `process()` function.
with sentry_sdk.metrics.timing(key="event_processing_time"):
	process()
```

## Options

You can use the following options to set/change the behavior of Metrics. As Metrics is still in the beta phase, these options are under the `_experiments` option.

<ConfigKey name="before_emit_metric">

A callback function that is called before a metric is emitted. If the callback returns `True` the metric is emitted. If the callback returns `False` the metric is not emitted. The given `tags` can also be updated in the callback function.

```python
def before_emit(key, value, unit, tags):
    if key == "removed-metric":
        return False
    tags["extra"] = "foo"
    del tags["release"]
    return True

sentry_sdk.init(
    ...
    _experiments={
        "before_emit_metric": before_emit,
    }
)
```

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="metric_code_locations">

If `True`, the line of code where the metric was emitted will be added to the metric. If `False`, the code location will be omitted.

Default: `True`

```python
sentry_sdk.init(
	...
    _experiments={
		"metric_code_locations": False,
	}
)
```

</ConfigKey>
