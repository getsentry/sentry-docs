If you find that Sentry's tracing functionality is generating too much data, for example, if you notice your spans quota is quickly being exhausted, you can choose to sample your traces.

Effective sampling is key to getting the most value from Sentry's performance monitoring while minimizing overhead. The Python SDK provides two ways to control the sampling rate. You can review the options and [examples](#traces-sampler-examples) below.

## Sampling Configuration Options

### 1. Uniform Sample Rate (`traces_sample_rate`)

`traces_sample_rate` is a floating-point value between `0.0` and `1.0`, inclusive, which controls the probability with which each transaction will be sampled:

<PlatformContent includePath="/performance/traces-sample-rate" />

With `traces_sample_rate` set to `0.25`, each transaction in your application is randomly sampled with a probability of `0.25`, so you can expect that one in every four transactions will be sent to Sentry.

### 2. Sampling Function (`traces_sampler`)

For more granular control, you can provide a `traces_sampler` function. This approach allows you to:

- Apply different sampling rates to different types of transactions
- Filter out specific transactions entirely
- Make sampling decisions based on transaction data
- Control the inheritance of sampling decisions in distributed traces
- Use custom attributes to modify sampling

<Alert>

It is strongly recommended when using a custom `traces_sampler` that you respect the parent sampling decision. This ensures your traces will be complete.

</Alert>

In distributed systems, implementing inheritance logic when trace information is propagated between services will ensure consistent sampling decisions across your entire distributed trace.

#### Traces Sampler Examples

1. Prioritizing Critical User Flows

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.types import SamplingContext

def traces_sampler(sampling_context: SamplingContext) -> float:
    # Use the parent sampling decision if we have an incoming trace.
    # Note: we strongly recommend respecting the parent sampling decision,
    # as this ensures your traces will be complete!
    parent_sampling_decision = sampling_context["parent_sampled"]
    if parent_sampling_decision is not None:
        return float(parent_sampling_decision)

    transaction_ctx = sampling_context["transaction_context"]
    name = transaction_ctx["name"]
    op = transaction_ctx["op"]

    # Sample all checkout transactions
    if name and ('/checkout' in name or op == 'checkout'):
        return 1.0

    # Sample 50% of login transactions
    if name and ('/login' in name or op == 'login'):
        return 0.5

    # Sample 10% of everything else
    return 0.1

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="your-dsn",
    traces_sampler=traces_sampler,
)
```

2. Handling Different Environments and Error Rates

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.types import SamplingContext

def traces_sampler(sampling_context: SamplingContext) -> float:
    # Use the parent sampling decision if we have an incoming trace.
    # Note: we strongly recommend respecting the parent sampling decision,
    # as this ensures your traces will be complete!
    parent_sampling_decision = sampling_context["parent_sampled"]
    if parent_sampling_decision is not None:
        return float(parent_sampling_decision)

    custom_sampling_ctx = sampling_context["custom_sampling_context"]
    environment = os.environ.get("ENVIRONMENT", "development")

    # Sample all transactions in development
    if environment == "development":
        return 1.0

    # Sample more transactions if there are recent errors
    # Note: hasRecentErrors is a custom attribute that needs to be set
    if custom_sampling_ctx.get("hasRecentErrors") is True:
        return 0.8

    # Sample based on environment
    if environment == "production":
        return 0.05  # 5% in production
    elif environment == "staging":
        return 0.2   # 20% in staging

    # Default sampling rate
    return 0.1

# Initialize the SDK with the sampling function
sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="your-dsn",
    traces_sampler=traces_sampler,
)

# Custom attributes need to be set on transaction start via
# the `custom_sampling_context` argument in order to be available
# in the traces_sampler
with sentry_sdk.start_transaction(
    name="GET /api/users",
    op="http.request",
    custom_sampling_context={"hasRecentErrors": True},
) as transaction:
    # your code here
```

3. Controlling Sampling Based on User and Transaction Properties

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.types import SamplingContext

def traces_sampler(sampling_context: SamplingContext) -> float:
    # Use the parent sampling decision if we have an incoming trace.
    # Note: we strongly recommend respecting the parent sampling decision,
    # as this ensures your traces will be complete!
    parent_sampling_decision = sampling_context["parent_sampled"]
    if parent_sampling_decision is not None:
        return float(parent_sampling_decision)

    custom_sampling_ctx = sampling_context["custom_sampling_context"]

    # Always sample for premium users
    # Note: user.tier is a custom attribute that needs to be set
    if custom_sampling_ctx.get("user", {}).get("tier") == "premium":
        return 1.0

    # Sample more transactions for users experiencing errors
    # Note: hasRecentErrors is a custom attribute
    if custom_sampling_ctx.get("hasRecentErrors") is True:
        return 0.8

    # Sample less for high-volume, low-value paths
    name = sampling_context["transaction_context"]["name"]
    if name and name.startswith("/api/metrics"):
        return 0.01

    # Default sampling rate
    return 0.2

# Initialize the SDK with the sampling function
sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="your-dsn",
    traces_sampler=traces_sampler,
)

# To set custom attributes for this example:
with sentry_sdk.start_transaction(
    name="GET /api/users",
    op="http.request",
    custom_sampling_context={"user": {"tier": "premium"}, "hasRecentErrors": True},
) as transaction:
    # Your code here
```

4. Complex Business Logic Sampling

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.types import SamplingContext

def traces_sampler(sampling_context: SamplingContext) -> float:
    # Use the parent sampling decision if we have an incoming trace.
    # Note: we strongly recommend respecting the parent sampling decision,
    # as this ensures your traces will be complete!
    parent_sampling_decision = sampling_context["parent_sampled"]
    if parent_sampling_decision is not None:
        return float(parent_sampling_decision)

    # Always sample critical business operations
    # Note: op is an SDK-provided attribute
    transaction_ctx = sampling_context["transaction_context"]
    if transaction_ctx["op"] in ["payment.process", "order.create", "user.verify"]:
        return 1.0

    custom_sampling_context = sampling_context["custom_sampling_context"]

    # Sample based on user segment
    # Note: user.segment is a custom attribute
    user_segment = custom_sampling_context.get("user", {}).get("segment")
    if user_segment == "enterprise":
        return 0.8
    elif user_segment == "premium":
        return 0.5

    # Sample based on transaction value
    # Note: transaction.value is a custom attribute
    transaction_value = custom_sampling_context.get("transaction", {}).get("value")
    if transaction_value is not None and transaction_value > 1000:  # High-value transactions
        return 0.7

    # Sample based on error rate in the service
    # Note: service.error_rate is a custom attribute
    error_rate = custom_sampling_context.get("service", {}).get("error_rate")
    if error_rate is not None and error_rate > 0.05:  # Error rate above 5%
        return 0.9

    # Default sampling rate
    return 0.1

# Initialize the SDK with the sampling function
sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="your-dsn",
    traces_sampler=traces_sampler,
)

# To set custom attributes for this example:
with sentry_sdk.start_transaction(
    name="Process Payment",
    op="payment.process",
    custom_sampling_context={"user": {"segment": "enterprise"}, "transaction": {"value": 1500}, "service": {"error_rate": 0.03}},
) as transaction:
    # Your code here

```

5. Performance-Based Sampling

```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.types import SamplingContext

def traces_sampler(sampling_context: SamplingContext) -> float:
    # Use the parent sampling decision if we have an incoming trace.
    # Note: we strongly recommend respecting the parent sampling decision,
    # as this ensures your traces will be complete!
    parent_sampling_decision = sampling_context["parent_sampled"]
    if parent_sampling_decision is not None:
        return float(parent_sampling_decision)

    custom_sampling_ctx = sampling_context["custom_sampling_context"]

    # Sample more transactions with high memory usage
    # Note: memory_usage_mb is a custom attribute
    memory_usage = custom_sampling_ctx.get("memory_usage_mb")
    if memory_usage is not None and memory_usage > 500:
        return 0.8

    # Sample more transactions with high CPU usage
    # Note: cpu_percent is a custom attribute
    cpu_percent = custom_sampling_ctx.get("cpu_percent")
    if cpu_percent is not None and cpu_percent > 80:
        return 0.8

    # Sample more transactions with high database load
    # Note: db_connections is a custom attribute
    db_connections = custom_sampling_ctx.get("db_connections")
    if db_connections is not None and db_connections > 100:
        return 0.7

    # Default sampling rate
    return 0.1

# Initialize the SDK with the sampling function
sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="your-dsn",
    traces_sampler=traces_sampler,
)

# To set custom attributes for this example:
with sentry_sdk.start_transaction(
    name="Process Data",
    op="data.process",
    custom_sampling_context={"memory_usage_mb": 600, "cpu_percent": 85, "db_connections": 120},
) as transaction:
    # Your code here
```
</details>

## The Sampling Context Object

When the `traces_sampler` function is called, the Sentry SDK passes a `sampling_context` object with information from the relevant span to help make sampling decisions:

```python
{
    "transaction_context": {
        "name": str,  # transaction title at creation time (SDK-provided)
        "op": str,  # short description of transaction type (SDK-provided)
        "data": Optional[dict[str, Any]]
    },
    "parent_sampled": Optional[bool],  # whether the parent transaction was sampled (SDK-provided)
    "parent_sample_rate": Optional[float],  # the sample rate used by the parent (SDK-provided)
    "custom_sampling_context": Optional[dict[str, Any]]  # additional custom data for sampling
}
```

### SDK-Provided vs. Custom Attributes

The sampling context contains both SDK-provided attributes and custom attributes:

**SDK-Provided Attributes:**
- `transaction_context.name`: The name of the transaction
- `transaction_context.op`: The operation type
- `parent_sampled`: Whether the parent transaction was sampled
- `parent_sample_rate`: The sample rate used by the parent

**Custom Attributes:**
- Any data you add to the `custom_sampling_context` parameter in `start_transaction`. Use this for data that you want to use for sampling decisions but don't want to include in the transaction data that gets sent to Sentry. Read more about sampling context [here](/platforms/python/configuration/sampling/#sampling-context).

## Sampling Decision Precedence

When multiple sampling mechanisms could apply, Sentry follows this order of precedence:

1. If a sampling decision is passed to `start_transaction`, that decision is used
2. If `traces_sampler` is defined, its decision is used. Although the `traces_sampler` can override the parent sampling decision, most users will want to ensure their `traces_sampler` respects the parent sampling decision
3. If no `traces_sampler` is defined, but there is a parent sampling decision from an incoming distributed trace, we use the parent sampling decision
4. If neither of the above, `traces_sample_rate` is used
5. If none of the above are set, no transactions are sampled. This is equivalent to setting `traces_sample_rate=0.0`

## How Sampling Propagates in Distributed Traces

Sentry uses a "head-based" sampling approach:

- A sampling decision is made in the originating service (the "head")
- This decision is propagated to all downstream services

The two key headers are:
- `sentry-trace`: Contains trace ID, span ID, and sampling decision
- `baggage`: Contains additional trace metadata including sample rate

The Sentry Python SDK automatically attaches these headers to outgoing HTTP requests when using auto-instrumentation with libraries like `requests`, `urllib3`, or `httpx`. For other communication channels, you can manually propagate trace information.
