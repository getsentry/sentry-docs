title: Set Up Tracing
description: "With Tracing, Sentry tracks your software performance, measuring metrics like throughput and latency, and displays the impact of errors across multiple systems."

## Prerequisites

* You have the <PlatformLink to="/">Python SDK installed</PlatformLink> (version 0.11.2 or higher)

## Configure

To enable tracing in your application, adjust the `traces_sample_rate` based on the number of trace samples you want to send to Sentry by adding the highlighted code snippet below. (Setting a value of `1.0` will send 100% of your traces.)

<SignInNote />

```python {diff}
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
+   # We recommend adjusting this value in production
+   traces_sample_rate=1.0,
)
```

If you’re adopting Tracing in a high-throughput environment, we recommend testing prior to deployment to ensure that your service’s performance characteristics maintain expectations.
