<Alert>

To capture transactions and spans customized to your organization's needs, you must first <PlatformLink to="/tracing/">set up tracing</PlatformLink>.

</Alert>

There are two ways that instrumentation is applied to your application:

## Automatic Instrumentation

Many integrations for popular frameworks automatically capture transactions that can be sent to Sentry. Read more about automatic instrumentation [here](/platforms/python/tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/).

## Custom Instrumentation
To add custom performance data to your application, you need to add custom instrumentation in the form of [spans](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/distributed-tracing/#traces-transactions-and-spans). Spans are a way to measure the time it takes for a specific action to occur. For example, you can create a span to measure the time it takes for a function to execute. Learn more about span lifecycles [here](/platforms/python/tracing/span-lifecycle/).
