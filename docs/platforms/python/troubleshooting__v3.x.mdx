## General

Use the information in this page to help answer these questions:

- "What do I do if scope data is leaking between requests?"
- "What do I do if my transaction has nested spans when they should be parallel?"
- "What do I do if the SDK has trouble sending events to Sentry?"

<Expandable title="Addressing Concurrency Issues">
  The short answer to the first two questions: make sure your `contextvars` work and
  that your isolation scope was cloned for each concurrency unit.

  Python supports several distinct solutions to concurrency, including threads and
  coroutines.

  The Python SDK does its best to figure out how contextual data such as tags set
  with `sentry_sdk.set_tags` is supposed to flow along your control flow. In most
  cases it works perfectly, but in a few situations some special care must be
  taken. This is specially true when working with a code base doing concurrency
  outside of the provided framework integrations.

  The general recommendation is to have one isolation scope per "concurrency unit"
  (thread/coroutine/etc). The SDK ensures every thread has an independent scope via the `ThreadingIntegration`.
  If you do concurrency with `asyncio` coroutines, make sure to use the `AsyncioIntegration`
  which will clone the correct scope in your `Task`s.

  The general pattern of usage for creating a new isolation scope is:

  ```python
  with sentry_sdk.isolation_scope() as scope:
  # In this block scope refers to a new fork of the original isolation scope,
  # with the same client and the same initial scope data.
  ```

  See the <PlatformLink to="/integrations/default-integrations/#threading">Threading</PlatformLink> section
  for a more complete example that involves forking the isolation scope.

<Expandable title="Context Variables vs gevent/eventlet">
  If you are using `gevent` (older than 20.5) or `eventlet` in your application and
  have configured it to monkeypatch the stdlib, the SDK will abstain from using
  `contextvars` even if it is available.

  The reason for that is that both of those libraries will monkeypatch the
  `threading` module only, and not the `contextvars` module.

  The real-world usecase where this actually comes up is if you're using Django
  3.0 within a `gunicorn+gevent` worker on Python 3.7. In such a scenario the
  monkeypatched `threading` module will honor the control flow of a gunicorn
  worker while the unpatched `contextvars` will not.

  It gets more complicated if you're using Django Channels in the same app, but a
  separate server process, as this is a legitimate usage of `asyncio` for which
  `contextvars` behaves more correctly. Make sure that your channels websocket
  server does not import or use gevent at all (and much less call
  `gevent.monkey.patch_all`), and you should be good.

  Even then there are still edge cases where this behavior is flat-out broken,
  such as mixing asyncio code with gevent/eventlet-based code. In that case there
  is no right, _static_ answer as to which context library to use. Even then
  gevent's aggressive monkeypatching is likely to interfere in a way that cannot
  be fixed from within the SDK.

  This [issue has been fixed with gevent 20.5](https://github.com/gevent/gevent/issues/1407) but continues to be one for
  eventlet.

<Expandable title="Network Issues">

Your SDK might have issues sending events to Sentry. You might see
`"Remote end closed connection without response"`, `"Connection aborted"`,
`"Connection reset by peer"`, or similar error messages in your logs.
In case of errors and tracing data, this manifests as errors and transactions
missing in Sentry. In case of cron monitors, you might be seeing crons
marked as timed out in Sentry when you know they've run successfully. The SDK
itself might be logging errors about the connection getting reset or the
server closing the connection without response.

If you experience this, try turning on the <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#keep-alive">keep-alive</PlatformLink> configuration option, available in SDK
versions `1.43.0` and up.

```python
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    # your usual options
    keep_alive=True,
)
```

If you need more fine-grained control over the behavior of the socket, check out
<PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#socket-options">socket-options</PlatformLink>.

<Expandable title="Multiprocessing deprecation after Python 3.12">

If you're on Python version 3.12 or greater, you might see the following deprecation warning on Linux environments since the SDK spawns several threads.

```
DeprecationWarning: This process is multi-threaded, use of fork() may lead to deadlocks in the child.
```

To remove this deprecation warning, set the [multiprocessing start method to `spawn` or `forkserver`](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/multiprocessing.html#contexts-and-start-methods).
Remember to do this only in the `__main__` block.

```python
import sentry_sdk
import multiprocessing
import concurrent.futures

sentry_sdk.init()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    multiprocessing.set_start_method("spawn")
    pool = concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor()
    pool.submit(sentry_sdk.capture_message, "world")
```

<Expandable title="Why was my tag value truncated?">

  Currently, every tag has a maximum character limit of 200 characters. Tags over the 200 character limit will become truncated, losing potentially important information. To retain this data, you can split data over several tags instead.

  For example, a 200+ character tagged request:

  `https://empowerplant.io/api/0/projects/ep/setup_form/?user_id=314159265358979323846264338327&tracking_id=EasyAsABC123OrSimpleAsDoReMi&product_name=PlantToHumanTranslator&product_id=161803398874989484820458683436563811772030917980576`

  The 200+ character request above will become truncated to:

  `https://empowerplant.io/api/0/projects/ep/setup_form/?user_id=314159265358979323846264338327&tracking_id=EasyAsABC123OrSimpleAsDoReMi&product_name=PlantToHumanTranslator&product_id=1618033988749894848`

## Profiling

<Expandable title="Why am I not seeing any profiling data?">

If you don't see any profiling data in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io), you can try the following:

- Ensure that <PlatformLink to="/tracing/">Tracing is enabled</PlatformLink>.
- Ensure that the automatic instrumentation is sending performance data to Sentry by going to the **Performance** page in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).
- If the automatic instrumentation is not sending performance data, try using <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation">custom instrumentation</PlatformLink>.
- Enable <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#debug">debug mode</PlatformLink> in the SDK and check the logs.

### Upgrading From Older SDK Versions

#### Transaction-Based Profiling

The transaction-based profiling feature was experimental prior to version `1.18.0`. To update your SDK to the latest version, remove `profiles_sample_rate` from `_experiments` and set it in the top-level options.

```python diff
sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
-   _experiments={
-       "profiles_sample_rate": 1.0,  # for versions before 1.18.0
-   },
+   profiles_sample_rate=1.0,
)
```

#### Continuous Profiling

The continuous profiling feature was experimental prior to version `2.24.1`. To upgrade your SDK to the latest version:

- Remove `continuous_profiling_auto_start` from `_experiments` and set `profile_lifecycle="trace"` in the top-level options.
- Add `profile_session_sample_rate` to the top-level options.
