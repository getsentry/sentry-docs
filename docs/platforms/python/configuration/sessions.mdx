A session represents the interaction between the user and the application. Sessions contain a timestamp, a status (if the session was OK or if it crashed), and are always linked to a release. Most Sentry SDKs can manage sessions automatically.

## Tracking Release Health With Sessions

Sessions are used to monitor the [health of releases](/product/releases/health/) by observing user adoption, usage of the application, percentage of [crashes](/product/releases/health/#crash), and [session data](/product/releases/health/#session). Release health will provide insight into the impact of crashes and bugs as it relates to user experience, and reveal trends with each new issue through the [Release Details](/product/releases/release-details/) graphs and filters.

In order to monitor release health, you need to set a <PlatformLink to="/configuration/releases/">release</PlatformLink>.
