Environments tell you where an error occurred, whether that's in your production system, your staging server, or elsewhere.

Environments are case-sensitive. The environment name can't contain newlines, spaces or forward slashes, can't be the string "None", or exceed 64 characters. You can't delete environments, but you can [hide](/product/sentry-basics/environments/#hidden-environments) them.

<PlatformContent includePath="set-environment" />

If you do not set `environment` in `init()`, the Sentry SDK will check for the environment variable, `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT`. If this is not set, `environment` will default to `production`.

Environments help you better filter issues, releases, and user feedback in the Issue Details page of sentry.io, which you learn more about in our [documentation that covers using environments](/product/sentry-basics/environments/).
