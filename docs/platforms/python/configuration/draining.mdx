The default behavior of most SDKs is to send out events over the network
asynchronously in the background. This means that some events might be lost if the application shuts down unexpectedly. The SDKs provide mechanisms to cope with this.

The Python SDK automatically drains on shutdown unless the `AtexitIntegration` is removed or the `shutdown_timeout`
config key is set to 0. If you need to manually drain, the client provides a `close` method:

```python
import sentry_sdk

client = sentry_sdk.get_client()
client.close(timeout=2.0)
```

After a call to `close`, the client  is disabled. It's important to
only call `close` immediately before shutting down the application.

Alternatively, the `flush` method drains the event queue while keeping the
client enabled for continued use.
