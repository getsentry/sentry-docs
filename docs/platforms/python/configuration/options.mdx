## Available Options

<TableOfContents ignoreIds={["available-options"]} />

## Core Options

Options that can be read from an environment variable (`SENTRY_DSN`, `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT`, `SENTRY_RELEASE`) are read automatically.

<SdkOption name='dsn' type='str' envVar='SENTRY_DSN' defaultValue='None'>

  The DSN tells the SDK where to send the events. If this option is not set, the SDK will just not send any data. The `dsn` config option takes precedence over the environment variable. Learn more about [DSN utilization](/product/sentry-basics/dsn-explainer/#dsn-utilization).

  <PlatformContent includePath="configuration/dsn" />

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name='debug' type='bool' defaultValue='False' envVar='SENTRY_DEBUG'>

  Turns debug mode on or off. When `True`, the SDK will attempt to print out debugging information. This can be useful if something goes wrong with event sending. The default is always `False`. It's generally not recommended to turn it on in production because of the increase in log output.

  The `debug` config option takes precedence over the environment variable.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="release" type='str' envVar='SENTRY_RELEASE' defaultValue='None'>

Sets the release. If not set, the SDK will try to automatically configure a release out of the box but it's a better idea to manually set it to guarantee that the release is in sync with your deploy integrations. Release names are strings, but some formats are detected by Sentry and might be rendered differently. See [the releases documentation](/platforms/python/configuration/releases/) to learn how the SDK tries to automatically configure a release.

The `release` config option takes precedence over the environment variable.

Learn more about how to send release data so Sentry can tell you about regressions between releases and identify the potential source in [the product documentation](/product/releases/) or the <SandboxLink scenario="releases">sandbox</SandboxLink>.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="environment" type='str' defaultValue='production' envVar='SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT'>

Sets the environment. This string is freeform and set to `production` by default. A release can be associated with more than one environment to separate them in the UI (think `staging` vs `production` or similar).

The `environment` config option takes precedence over the environment variable.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="dist" type='str' defaultValue='None'>

The distribution of the application. Distributions are used to disambiguate build or deployment variants of the same release of an application. The dist can be for example a build number.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="sample_rate" type='float' defaultValue='1.0'>

Configures the sample rate for error events, in the range of `0.0` to `1.0`. The default is `1.0`, which means that 100% of error events will be sent. If set to `0.1`, only 10% of error events will be sent. Events are picked randomly.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="error_sampler" type='function' defaultValue='None'>

Dynamically configures the sample rate for error events on a per-event basis. This configuration option accepts a function, which takes two parameters (the `event` and the `hint`), and which returns a boolean (indicating whether the event should be sent to Sentry) or a floating-point number between `0.0` and `1.0`, inclusive (where the number indicates the probability the event is sent to Sentry; the SDK will randomly decide whether to send the event with the given probability).

If this configuration option is specified, the `sample_rate` option is ignored.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name='ignore_errors' type='list' defaultValue='[]'>
  A list of exception class names that shouldn't be sent to Sentry. Errors that are an instance of these exceptions or a subclass of them, will be filtered out before they're sent to Sentry.

  By default, all errors are sent.
</SdkOption>


<SdkOption name="max_breadcrumbs" type='int' defaultValue='100'>

This variable controls the total amount of breadcrumbs that should be captured. This defaults to `100`, but you can set this to any number. However, you should be aware that Sentry has a [maximum payload size](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/data-model/envelopes/#size-limits) and any events exceeding that payload size will be dropped.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="attach_stacktrace" type='bool' defaultValue='False'>

When enabled, stack traces are automatically attached to all messages logged. Stack traces are always attached to exceptions; however, when this option is set, stack traces are also sent with messages. This option, for instance, means that stack traces appear next to all log messages.

Grouping in Sentry is different for events with stack traces and without. As a result, you will get new groups as you enable or disable this flag for certain events.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="send_default_pii" type='bool' defaultValue='None'>

If this flag is enabled, [certain personally identifiable information (PII)](/platforms/python/data-management/data-collected/) is added by active integrations.

If you enable this option, be sure to manually remove what you don't want to send using our features for managing [_Sensitive Data_](../../data-management/sensitive-data/).

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="event_scrubber" type='sentry_sdk.scrubber.EventScrubber' defaultValue='None'>

Scrubs the event payload for sensitive information such as cookies, sessions, and passwords from a `denylist`. It can additionally be used to scrub from another `pii_denylist` if `send_default_pii` is disabled. See how to [configure the scrubber here](../../data-management/sensitive-data/#event-scrubber).

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="include_source_context" type='bool' defaultValue='True'>

When enabled, source context will be included in events sent to Sentry. This source context includes the five lines of code above and below the line of code where an error happened.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="include_local_variables" type='bool' defaultValue='True'>

When enabled, the SDK will capture a snapshot of local variables to send with the event to help with debugging.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="add_full_stack" type='bool' defaultValue='False'>

When capturing errors, Sentry stack traces typically only include frames that start the moment an error occurs. But if the `add_full_stack` option is enabled (set to `True`), all frames from the start of execution will be included in the stack trace sent to Sentry.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="max_stack_frames" type='int' defaultValue='100'>

This option limits the number of stack frames that will be captured when `add_full_stack` is enabled.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="server_name" type='str' defaultValue='None'>

This option can be used to supply a server name. When provided, the name of the server is sent along and persisted in the event. For many integrations, the server name actually corresponds to the device hostname, even in situations where the machine is not actually a server.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="project_root" type='str' defaultValue='os.getcwd()'>

The full path to the root directory of your application.

The `project_root` is used to mark frames in a stack trace either as being in your application or outside of the application.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="in_app_include" type='list[str]' defaultValue='[]'>

A list of string prefixes of module names that belong to the app. This option takes precedence over `in_app_exclude`.

Sentry differentiates stack frames that are directly related to your application ("in application") from stack frames that come from other packages such as the standard library, frameworks, or other dependencies. The application package is automatically marked as `inApp`. The difference is visible in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io), where only the "in application" frames are displayed by default.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="in_app_exclude" type='list[str]' defaultValue='[]'>

A list of string prefixes of module names that do not belong to the app, but rather to third-party packages. Modules considered not part of the app will be hidden from stack traces by default.

This option can be overridden using `in_app_include`.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="max_request_body_size" type='str' defaultValue='medium'>

This parameter controls whether integrations should capture HTTP request bodies. It can be set to one of the following values:

- `never`: Request bodies are never sent.
- `small`: Only small request bodies will be captured. The cutoff for small depends on the SDK (typically 4KB).
- `medium`: Medium and small requests will be captured (typically 10KB).
- `always`: The SDK will always capture the request body as long as Sentry can make sense of it.

Please note that the Sentry server [limits HTTP request body size](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/expected-features/data-handling/#variable-size). The server always enforces its size limit, regardless of how you configure this option.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="max_value_length" type='int' defaultValue='1024'>

The number of characters after which the values containing text in the event payload will be truncated.

<Alert level='warning'>
  If the value you set for this is exceptionally large, the event may exceed 1
  MiB and will be dropped by Sentry.
</Alert>

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="ca_certs" type='str' defaultValue='None'>

A path to an alternative CA bundle file in PEM-format.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="send_client_reports" type='bool' defaultValue='True'>

Set this boolean to `False` to disable sending of client reports. Client reports allow the client to send status reports about itself to Sentry, such as information about events that were dropped before being sent.

</SdkOption>

## Integration Configuration

<SdkOption name="integrations" type='list[sentry_sdk.integrations.Integration]' defaultValue='[]'>

List of integrations to enable in addition to [auto-enabling integrations](/platforms/python/integrations). This setting can be used to override the default config options for a specific auto-enabling integration or to add an integration that is not auto-enabled.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="disabled_integrations" type='list[sentry_sdk.integrations.Integration]' defaultValue='[]'>

List of integrations that will be disabled. This setting can be used to explicitly turn off specific [auto-enabling](/platforms/python/integrations/#available-integrations) or [default](/platforms/python/integrations/default-integrations/) integrations.
</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="auto_enabling_integrations" type='bool' defaultValue='True'>

Configures whether [auto-enabling integrations](/platforms/python/integrations/#available-integrations) should be enabled.

When set to `False`, no auto-enabling integrations will be enabled by default, even if the corresponding framework/library is detected.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="default_integrations" type='bool' defaultValue='True'>

Configures whether [default integrations](/platforms/python/integrations/default-integrations/) should be enabled.

Setting `default_integrations` to `False` disables all default integrations **as well as all auto-enabling integrations**, unless they are specifically added in the `integrations` option, described above.
</SdkOption>

## Hooks

These options can be used to hook the SDK in various ways to customize the reporting of events.

<SdkOption name="before_send" type='function' defaultValue='None'>

This function is called with an SDK-specific message or error event object, and can return a modified event object, or `null` to skip reporting the event. This can be used, for instance, for manual PII stripping before sending.

By the time `before_send` is executed, all scope data has already been applied to the event. Further modification of the scope won't have any effect.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="before_send_transaction" type='function' defaultValue='None'>

This function is called with an SDK-specific transaction event object, and can return a modified transaction event object, or `null` to skip reporting the event. One way this might be used is for manual PII stripping before sending.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="before_breadcrumb" type='function' defaultValue='None'>

This function is called with an SDK-specific breadcrumb object before the breadcrumb is added to the scope. When nothing is returned from the function, the breadcrumb is dropped. To pass the breadcrumb through, return the first argument, which contains the breadcrumb object.
The callback typically gets a second argument (called a "hint") which contains the original object from which the breadcrumb was created to further customize what the breadcrumb should look like.

</SdkOption>

## Transport Options

Transports are used to send events to Sentry. Transports can be customized to some degree to better support highly specific deployments.

<SdkOption name="transport" type='sentry_sdk.transport.Transport' defaultValue='None'>

  Switches out the transport used to send events. How this works depends on the SDK. It can, for instance, be used to capture events for unit-testing or to send it through some more complex setup that requires proxy authentication.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="transport_queue_size" type='int' defaultValue='100'>

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="http_proxy" defaultValue='None'>

When set, a proxy can be configured that should be used for outbound requests. This is also used for HTTPS requests unless a separate `https_proxy` is configured. However, not all SDKs support a separate HTTPS proxy. SDKs will attempt to default to the system-wide configured proxy, if possible. For instance, on Unix systems, the `http_proxy` environment variable will be picked up.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="https_proxy" defaultValue='None'>

Configures a separate proxy for outgoing HTTPS requests. This value might not be supported by all SDKs. When not supported the `http-proxy` value is also used for HTTPS requests at all times.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="proxy_headers" type='dict[str, str]' defaultValue='None'>

A dict containing additional proxy headers (usually for authentication) to be forwarded to `urllib3`'s [`ProxyManager`](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/1.24.3/reference/index.html#urllib3.poolmanager.ProxyManager).

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="shutdown_timeout" type='int' defaultValue='2'>

Controls how many seconds to wait before shutting down. Sentry SDKs send events from a background queue. This queue is given a certain amount to drain pending events. The default is SDK specific but typically around two seconds. Setting this value too low may cause problems for sending events from command line applications. Setting the value too high will cause the application to block for a long time for users experiencing network connectivity problems.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="keep_alive" type='bool' defaultValue='False'>

Determines whether to keep the connection alive between requests. This can be useful in environments where you encounter frequent network issues such as connection resets.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="cert_file" type='str' envVar='CLIENT_CERT_FILE' defaultValue='None'>

Path to the client certificate to use. If set, supersedes the `CLIENT_CERT_FILE` environment variable.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="key_file" type='str' envVar='CLIENT_KEY_FILE' defaultValue='None'>

Path to the key file to use. If set, supersedes the `CLIENT_KEY_FILE` environment variable.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="socket_options" defaultValue='None'>

An optional list of socket options to use. These provide fine-grained, low-level control over the way the SDK connects to Sentry. If provided, the options will override the default `urllib3` [socket options](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/urllib3.connection.html#urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection).

```python
import socket
from urllib3.connection import HTTPConnection

sentry_sdk.init(
    socket_options=HTTPConnection.default_socket_options + [
        (socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_KEEPALIVE, 1),
    ],
)
```

</SdkOption>

## Tracing Options

<SdkOption name="traces_sample_rate" type='float' defaultValue='None'>

A number between `0` and `1`, controlling the percentage chance a given transaction will be sent to Sentry. (`0` represents 0% while `1` represents 100%.) Applies equally to all transactions created in the app. Either this or `traces_sampler` must be defined to enable tracing.

If `traces_sample_rate` is `0`, this means that no new traces will be created. However, if you have another service (for example a JS frontend) that makes requests to your service that include trace information, those traces will be continued and thus transactions will be sent to Sentry.

If you want to disable all tracing you need to set `traces_sample_rate=None`. In this case, no new traces will be started and no incoming traces will be continued.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="traces_sampler" type='function' defaultValue='None'>

A function responsible for determining the percentage chance a given transaction will be sent to Sentry. It will automatically be passed information about the transaction and the context in which it's being created, and must return a number between `0` (0% chance of being sent) and `1` (100% chance of being sent). Can also be used for filtering transactions, by returning `0` for those that are unwanted. Either this or `traces_sample_rate` must be defined to enable tracing.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="trace_propagation_targets" type='list' defaultValue="['.*']">

An optional property that controls which downstream services receive tracing data, in the form of a `sentry-trace` and a `baggage` header attached to any outgoing HTTP requests.

The option may contain a list of strings or regex against which the URLs of outgoing requests are matched.
If one of the entries in the list matches the URL of an outgoing request, trace data will be attached to that request.
String entries do not have to be full matches, meaning the URL of a request is matched when it _contains_ a string provided through the option.

If `trace_propagation_targets` is not provided, trace data is attached to every outgoing request from the instrumented client.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="functions_to_trace" type='list[str]' defaultValue='[]'>

An optional list of functions that should be set up for tracing. For each function in the list, a span will be created when the function is executed.
Functions in the list are represented as strings containing the fully qualified name of the function.

This is a convenient option, making it possible to have one central place for configuring what functions to trace, instead of having custom instrumentation scattered all over your code base.

To learn more, see the [Custom Instrumentation](/platforms/python/tracing/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation/#define-span-creation-in-a-central-place) documentation.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="enable_backpressure_handling" type='bool' defaultValue='True'>

When enabled, a new monitor thread will be spawned to perform health checks on the SDK. If the system is unhealthy, the SDK will keep halving the `traces_sample_rate` set by you in 10 second intervals until recovery. This down sampling helps ensure that the system stays stable and reduces SDK overhead under high load.

This option is enabled by default.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="enable_db_query_source" type='bool' defaultValue='True'>

When enabled, the source location will be added to database queries.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="db_query_source_threshold_ms" type='int' defaultValue='100'>

The threshold in milliseconds for adding the source location to database queries. The query location will be added to the query for queries slower than the specified threshold.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="custom_repr" type='function' defaultValue='None'>

A custom [repr](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#repr) function to run while serializing an object. Use this to control how your custom objects and classes are visible in Sentry.

Return a string for that repr value to be used or `None` to continue serializing how Sentry would have done it anyway.

```python
def custom_repr(obj):
    if isinstance(obj, MyCustomClass):
        return "<MyCustomClass>"
    else
        return None

sentry_sdk.init(custom_repr=custom_repr)
```

</SdkOption>

## Profiling Options

<SdkOption name="profiles_sample_rate" type='float' defaultValue='None'>

  A number between `0` and `1`, controlling the percentage chance a given sampled transaction will be profiled. (`0` represents 0% while `1` represents 100%.) Applies equally to all transactions created in the app. This is relative to the tracing sample rate - e.g. `0.5` means 50% of sampled transactions will be profiled.

</SdkOption>

<SdkOption name="profiles_sampler" type='function' defaultValue='None'>


</SdkOption>
