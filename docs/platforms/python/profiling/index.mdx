## Enable Performance Monitoring

Profiling depends on Sentryâ€™s performance monitoring product being enabled beforehand. To enable performance monitoring in the SDK:

<SignInNote />

```python
sentry_sdk.init(
  dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  traces_sample_rate=1.0,
)
```

Check out the <PlatformLink to="/performance/">performance setup documentation</PlatformLink> for more detailed information on how to configure sampling. Setting the sample rate to 1.0 means all transactions will be captured.

## Enable Profiling

<Note>

Python profiling is available starting in SDK version `1.18.0`.

</Note>

<SignInNote />

```python
import sentry_sdk

def profiles_sampler(sampling_context):
    # ...
    # return a number between 0 and 1 or a boolean

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,

    # To set a uniform sample rate
    # Set profiles_sample_rate to 1.0 to profile 100%
    # of sampled transactions.
    # We recommend adjusting this value in production,
    profiles_sample_rate=1.0,

    # Alternatively, to control sampling dynamically
    profiles_sampler=profiles_sampler
)
```

<Note>

The <PlatformIdentifier name="profiles_sample_rate" /> setting is _relative_ to the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces_sample_rate" /> setting.

</Note>

### Upgrading from older SDK versions

The feature was experimental prior to version `1.17.0`. To update to the latest SDK, remove `profiles_sample_rate` from `_experiments` and set it in the top-level options.

<SignInNote />

```python
sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
    _experiments={
      "profiles_sample_rate": 1.0,  # for versions before 1.17.0
    },
)
```
