## Enable Profiling

<Note>

Python profiling is stable as of SDK version `1.18.0`.

</Note>


```python
import sentry_sdk

def profiles_sampler(sampling_context):
    # ...
    # return a number between 0 and 1 or a boolean

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,

    # To set a uniform sample rate
    # Set profiles_sample_rate to 1.0 to profile 100%
    # of sampled transactions.
    # We recommend adjusting this value in production,
    profiles_sample_rate=1.0,

    # Alternatively, to control sampling dynamically
    profiles_sampler=profiles_sampler
)
```

<Note>

The <PlatformIdentifier name="profiles_sample_rate" /> setting is _relative_ to the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces_sample_rate" /> setting.

For Profiling to work, you have to first enable Sentryâ€™s tracing via `traces_sample_rate` (like in the example above). Read our <PlatformLink to="/tracing/">tracing setup documentation</PlatformLink> to learn how to configure sampling. If you set your sample rate to 1.0, all transactions will be captured.

</Note>

### Upgrading from older SDK versions

Profiling was experimental in SDK versions `1.17.0` and older. Learn how to upgrade <PlatformLink to="/profiling/troubleshooting/#ipgrading-from-older-sdk-versions">here</PlatformLink>.
