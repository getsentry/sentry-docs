## Enable Profiling

<Note>

Python profiling is stable as of SDK version `1.18.0`.

</Note>


```python
import sentry_sdk

def profiles_sampler(sampling_context):
    # ...
    # return a number between 0 and 1 or a boolean

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,

    # To set a uniform sample rate
    # Set profiles_sample_rate to 1.0 to profile 100%
    # of sampled transactions.
    # We recommend adjusting this value in production,
    profiles_sample_rate=1.0,

    # Alternatively, to control sampling dynamically
    profiles_sampler=profiles_sampler
)
```

<Note>

The <PlatformIdentifier name="profiles_sample_rate" /> setting is _relative_ to the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces_sample_rate" /> setting.

For Profiling to work, you have to first enable Sentry’s tracing via `traces_sample_rate` (like in the example above). Read our <PlatformLink to="/tracing/">tracing setup documentation</PlatformLink> to learn how to configure sampling. If you set your sample rate to 1.0, all transactions will be captured.

</Note>

### Upgrading from older SDK versions

Profiling was experimental in SDK versions `1.17.0` and older. Learn how to upgrade <PlatformLink to="/profiling/troubleshooting/#ipgrading-from-older-sdk-versions">here</PlatformLink>.

## Enable Continuous Profiling

<Include name="feature-stage-beta.mdx" />

_(New in version 2.13.0)_

The current profiling implementation stops the profiler automatically after 30 seconds (unless you manually stop it earlier). Naturally, this limitation makes it difficult to get full coverage of your app's execution. We now offer an experimental continuous mode, where profiling data is periodically uploaded while running, with no limit on how long the profiler may run.

To get started with continuous profiling, you can start and stop the profiler directly with `sentry_sdk.profiler.start_profiler` and `sentry_sdk.profiler.stop_profiler`.

<Note>

If you previously set `profiles_sample_rate` or `profilers_sampler` to use transaction-based profiling, you must remove those lines of code from your configuration in order to use continuous profiling.

</Note>

```python
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
)

sentry_sdk.profiler.start_profiler()

# run some code here

sentry_sdk.profiler.stop_profiler()
```

For some applications such as web servers, it may be difficult to call `sentry_sdk.profiler.start_profiler` in every process. Instead, you can use the `continuous_profiling_auto_start` option to automatically start the continuous profiler when a transaction is started.

```python
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
    _experiments={
      "continuous_profiling_auto_start": True,
    },
)
```

These new APIs do not offer any sampling functionality—every call to start the profiler will start it, and the same goes for launch profiles if you've configured that. If you are interested in reducing the amount of profiles that run, you must take care to do it at the callsites.

Continuous profiling has implications for your org's billing structure. This feature is only available for subscription plans that enrolled after June 5, 2024.
