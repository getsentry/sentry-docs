If you don't see any profiling data in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io), you can try the following:

- Ensure that <PlatformLink to="/tracing/">Tracing is enabled</PlatformLink>.
- Ensure that the automatic instrumentation is sending performance data to Sentry by going to the **Performance** page in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).
- If the automatic instrumentation is not sending performance data, try using <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation">custom instrumentation</PlatformLink>.
- Enable <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#debug">debug mode</PlatformLink> in the SDK and check the logs.


### Upgrading From Older SDK Versions

The feature was experimental prior to version `1.17.0`. To update your SDK to the latest version, remove `profiles_sample_rate` from `_experiments` and set it in the top-level options.


```python
sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,
    _experiments={
      "profiles_sample_rate": 1.0,  # for versions before 1.17.0
    },
)
```
