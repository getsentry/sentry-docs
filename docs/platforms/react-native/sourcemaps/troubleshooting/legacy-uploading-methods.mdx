This page describes how to upload source maps for older React Native SDKs. If you're using the latest version of the SDK, [follow these instructions](/platforms/react-native/sourcemaps).

## Legacy Instructions for Preparing Source Maps for a Release

You need to generate and upload the source maps at build time for **every release** of your app for the events sent to be correctly unminified. To do so, follow these steps:

### 1. Configure CLI

Configure the CLI by reviewing the [configuration guide](/product/cli/configuration/) for CLI commands.

### 2. Generate the bundle and source maps

<Alert level="warning" title="Hermes">

If you use the **Hermes engine**, you will need to [follow this guide to compile source maps for Hermes](/platforms/react-native/manual-setup/hermes/#custom-source-maps).

</Alert>

You can use the React Native CLI to generate the JavaScript bundle and source maps for your app:

```bash {tabTitle:Android}
react-native bundle \
  --dev false \
  --platform android \
  --entry-file index.android.js \
  --reset-cache \
  --bundle-output index.android.bundle \
  --sourcemap-output index.android.bundle.map
```

```bash {tabTitle:iOS}
react-native bundle \
  --dev false \
  --platform ios \
  --entry-file index.ios.js \
  --reset-cache \
  --bundle-output main.jsbundle \
  --sourcemap-output main.jsbundle.map
```

[Learn more about the React Native CLI bundle command](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/commands.md#bundle).

#### 2.1 Pass your entry file

Pass your entry file to `--entry-file` for Android or iOS, respectively. By default, this file is usually named `index.js`. It is often named `index.android.js` for Android or `index.ios.js` for iOS.

#### 2.2 Output your bundle files and source maps

These files will output your bundle and source maps. By default, these files are named `index.android.bundle` and `index.android.bundle.map` for Android and `main.jsbundle` and `main.jsbundle.map` for iOS.

<Note>

The source map's name must be the bundle's name appended with `.map` for source maps to correctly be detected.

</Note>

### 3. Upload the bundle and source maps

```bash {tabTitle:Android}
node_modules/@sentry/cli/bin/sentry-cli sourcemaps upload \
    --release <release> \
    --dist <dist> \
    --strip-prefix /path/to/project/root \
    index.android.bundle index.android.bundle.map
```

```bash {tabTitle:iOS}
node_modules/@sentry/cli/bin/sentry-cli sourcemaps upload \
    --release <release> \
    --dist <dist> \
    --strip-prefix /path/to/project/root \
    main.jsbundle main.jsbundle.map
```
