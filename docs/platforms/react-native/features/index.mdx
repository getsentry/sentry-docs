Sentry's React Native SDK enables automatic reporting of errors and exceptions, and identifies performance issues in your application. The below, is a list of features that are available as part of this SDK.

- Automatic Native Crash <Link to="/product/issues/">Error Tracking</Link> (using both `sentry-cocoa` & `sentry-android`).
- Automatic detection of <Link to="/platforms/android/configuration/app-not-respond">Application Not Responding (ANR)</Link> on Android and <Link to="/platforms/apple/guides/ios/configuration/app-hangs/">App Hangs</Link> on iOS.
- Offline storage of events:
  - Android: Offline caching when a device is offline; we send a report once the application is restarted.
  - iOS: Offline caching when a device is unable to connect; we send a report once we receive another event.
- Events <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/context/">enriched</PlatformLink> with device data.
- <PlatformLink to="/data-management/debug-files/source-context/">Source Context</PlatformLink> shows snippets of your code around the location of stack frames.
- <Link to="https://reactnative.dev/blog/2019/07/03/version-60#native-modules-are-now-autolinked">Autolinking</Link>.
- <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/">Breadcrumbs</PlatformLink> created for outgoing `http` request with XHR and Fetch; UI and system events; and console logs.
- <Link to="/product/releases/health/">Release health</Link> tracks crash free users and sessions.
- <Link to="/product/performance/">Tracing</Link> creates transactions automatically for:
  - <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#app-start-instrumentation">App Start</PlatformLink> time.
  - <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#enable-routing-instrumentation">Routing Instrumentation</PlatformLink> (React Navigation v4 and above and React Native Navigation).

  - <PlatformLink to="/tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#react-profiler">React Profiler</PlatformLink> tracks React components.
- Under the hood the SDK relies on our <Link to="/platforms/javascript/">JavaScript SDK</Link>, which makes all functions available for JavaScript also available in this SDK.
- On Device symbolication for JavaScript (in Debug).
- <PlatformLink to="/manual-setup/ram-bundles/">RAM bundle support</PlatformLink>.
- <PlatformLink to="/manual-setup/hermes/">Hermes support</PlatformLink>.
- <PlatformLink to="/manual-setup/expo/">Expo support</PlatformLink> out of the box.
- <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/attachments/">Attachments</PlatformLink> enrich your event by storing additional files, such as config or log files.
- <PlatformLink to="/user-feedback/">User Feedback</PlatformLink> provides the ability to collect user information when an event occurs.
- <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/viewhierarchy/">View Hierarchy</PlatformLink> shows the structure of native components at the time an error occurred.
