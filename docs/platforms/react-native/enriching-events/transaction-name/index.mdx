title: Transaction Name
description: "Learn how to set or override the transaction name to capture the user and gain critical pieces of information that construct a unique identity in Sentry."

The current transaction name is used to group transactions in our
[Performance](/product/performance/) product, as well as annotate error events
with their point of failure.

The transaction name can reference the current web app route, or the current
task being executed. For example:

- `GET /api/{version}/users/`
- `UserListView`
- `myapp.tasks.renew_all_subscriptions`

Ideally, the transaction name does not contain variable values such as user
IDs but has rather low cardinality while still uniquely identifying a piece of
code you care about.

A lot of our framework integrations already set a transaction name, though you can set one yourself.

You'll first need to import the SDK, as usual:

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react-native";
```

To override the name of the currently running transaction:

```javascript
Sentry.getCurrentScope().setTransactionName("UserListView");
```

Please refer to [the tracing documentation](../../tracing/) for how to start and stop transactions.
