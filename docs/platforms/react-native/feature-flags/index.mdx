## Prerequisites

- [Sentry SDK](/platforms/react-native/#configure) version `7.0.0`.

## Usage

The Feature Flags integration allows you to manually track feature flag evaluations through an API. These evaluations are held in memory and sent to Sentry on error and transaction events. **At the moment, we only support boolean flag evaluations.**

```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react-native";

const flagsIntegration = Sentry.featureFlagsIntegration();
flagsIntegration.addFeatureFlag('feature_flag_a', true);

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [flagsIntegration],
});
```

Calling this function multiple times with the same flag name will override the previous value.
