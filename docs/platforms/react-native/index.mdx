On this page, we get you up and running with Sentry's React Native SDK, automatically reporting errors and exceptions in your application. If you prefer to follow video instructions, see [How to Install the Sentry React Native SDK in 60 Seconds](https://vimeo.com/899369012).

<Note>

If you don't already have an account and Sentry project established, head over to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/signup/), then return to this page.

## Install

<OnboardingOptionButtons

    'error-monitoring',
    'performance',
    'profiling',

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your application's runtime. These are platform-specific and allow Sentry to have a deep understanding of how your application works.

To install, run `@sentry/wizard`:

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npx @sentry/wizard@latest -s -i reactNative
```

[Sentry Wizard](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-wizard) will patch your project accordingly, though you can [set up manually](/platforms/react-native/manual-setup/manual-setup/) if you prefer. You only need to patch the project once. Then you can add the patched files to your version control system.

<Expandable title="The following tasks will be performed by the Sentry Wizard">

- Install the `@sentry/react-native` package.
- Enable the Sentry React Native Gradle build step for Android to auto-upload generated source maps and debug symbols.
- Wrap the _Bundle React Native code and images_ Xcode project build phase script to upload generated source maps and collect bundled node modules.
- Add _Upload Debug Symbols to Sentry_ Xcode project build phase.
- Run `pod install`.
- Store build credentials in _*ios/sentry.properties*_ and _*android/sentry.properties*_.
- Configure Sentry for the supplied DSN in your _*App.tsx*_ file.

If you're using Expo, [read our docs](/platforms/react-native/manual-setup/expo/) to learn how to add Sentry to your Expo project. This SDK will work for both managed and bare projects.


## Configure

To capture all errors, initialize the Sentry React Native SDK as soon as possible.

<SignInNote />

```javascript {filename:App.js} {"onboardingOptions": {"performance": "5-7", "profiling": "8-12"}}
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react-native";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100% of transactions for tracing.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production.
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  _experiments: {
    // profilesSampleRate is relative to tracesSampleRate.
    // Here, we'll capture profiles for 100% of transactions.
    profilesSampleRate: 1.0,
  },
});
```

<OnboardingOption optionId="performance">

#### Wrap Your App

To automatically instrument your app with [touch event tracking](/platforms/react-native/configuration/touchevents/) and [automatic tracing](/platforms/react-native/tracing/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/), wrap it with `Sentry.wrap`:

```javascript {filename:App.js}
export default Sentry.wrap(App);
```

This is not required if your app does not have a single parent "App" component.

</OnboardingOption>


## Verify

Verify that your app is sending events to Sentry by adding the following snippet, which includes an intentional error. You should see the error reported in Sentry within a few minutes.

```javascript {tabTitle:Throw Error}
throw new Error("My first Sentry error!");
```

```javascript {tabTitle:Native Crash}
Sentry.nativeCrash();
```
