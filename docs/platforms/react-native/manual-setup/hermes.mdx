Sentry React Native SDK supports `Hermes` engine out of the box.

## Source Maps

Read our React Native [Source Maps](/platforms/react-native/sourcemaps/) documentation to learn how to upload source maps for your app.

## Troubleshooting

This section describes common issues when using Hermes and how to resolve them.

### Multiple ways of Enabling Source Maps in Xcode

If you use `EXTRA_PACKAGER_ARGS`, you only need the packager source map. This is the default behavior if you used [`@sentry/wizard`](/platforms/react-native/#install). If you use [`SOURCEMAP_FILE`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/debugging-release-builds#enabling-source-maps), the combined Hermes source map is necessary.

### Check RN Tooling Steps

Our React Native [Source Maps](/platforms/react-native/sourcemaps/) documentation is based on [`react-native-xcode.sh`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/0.71-stable/scripts/react-native-xcode.sh) for iOS and on [`BundleHermesCTask.kt`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/0.71-stable/packages/react-native-gradle-plugin/src/main/kotlin/com/facebook/react/tasks/BundleHermesCTask.kt) for Android. If you are having issues with the manually generated artifacts check the steps of your React Native tooling using the previous links.

<Note>

React Native [`0.70`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/e3a5fbe72f966b27b967192317d7072db52d1c8c/scripts/react-native-xcode.sh#L141) and CodePush Update minifies the packager bundle by default.

</Note>

<Note>

[`BundleHermesCTask.kt`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/0.71-stable/packages/react-native-gradle-plugin/src/main/kotlin/com/facebook/react/tasks/BundleHermesCTask.kt) is only available from version `0.71` on. For previous versions, use [`react.gradle`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/0.70-stable/react.gradle).

</Note>

For more details see [this issue](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/34043) in the React Native repository.

### Don't Combine Hermes and RAM Bundles

If you are using Hermes, you should not have the [RAM bundles](/platforms/react-native/manual-setup/ram-bundles/) feature enabled. In Hermes, when loading the bytecode, `mmap` ensures that the entire file is not loaded. Using Hermes with RAM bundles might lead to issues, because those mechanisms are not compatible with each other.

### Minimum Required Versions

Sentry added support for `react-native` builds that use the `hermes` engine, which required changes to the Sentry SDK, `sentry-cli` as well as Sentry itself.

Sentry customers using the SaaS product ([sentry.io](https://sentry.io/)) will need to update the SDK and `sentry-cli`.
The minimum required version for the SDK is `@sentry/react-native` [SDK version `1.3.3`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-react-native/releases/tag/1.3.3),
and `@sentry/cli` [version `1.51.1`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cli/releases/tag/1.51.1).

For self-hosted Sentry users, the minimum version required is [f07352b](https://hub.docker.com/r/getsentry/sentry/tags?page=1&name=f07352b).

Once you have the minimum version of the SDK, Sentry provides the standard integration as described in the [React Native Sentry documentation](/platforms/react-native/).

### Upload Using Sentry Fastlane Plugin

To upload generated sourcemaps using Fastlane, use the `sentry_upload_sourcemap` action. See how to install Sentry Fastlane Plugin [here](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-fastlane-plugin).
