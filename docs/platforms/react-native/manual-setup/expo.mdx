---

To set up the Sentry React Native SDK in your Expo project, follow the steps on this page.

## Prerequisities

- [Expo SDK 50](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/upgrading-expo-sdk-walkthrough/) or newer.
  - [Expo SDK 49](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/using-sentry/) and older are supported by the `sentry-expo` package.
- [Migrate from `sentry-expo` to `@sentry/react-native`](/platforms/react-native/migration/sentry-expo/).
- [Sign up for an account](https://sentry.io/signup/).

## Automatic Install

Use the [Sentry Wizard](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-wizard) to patch your project automatically, as shown below. Alternatively, you can follow the [Manual Install](./#manual-install) if you prefer. You only need to patch the project once. Then, you can add the patched files to your version control system.

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i reactNative
```

<Expandable title="The following tasks will be performed by the Sentry Wizard">

- Install the `@sentry/react-native` package.
- Add the `@sentry/react-native/metro` to the _*metro.config.js*_ Metro configuration.
- Add the `@sentry/react-native/expo` to the _*app.json*_ Expo configuration.
- Enable the Sentry React Native Gradle build step for Android to auto-upload generated source maps and debug symbols.
- Wrap the _Bundle React Native code and images_ Xcode project build phase script to upload generated source maps and collect bundled node modules.
- Add _Upload Debug Symbols to Sentry_ Xcode project build phase.
- Run `pod install`.
- Store build credentials in _*ios/sentry.properties*_, _*android/sentry.properties*_ and _*env.local*_.
- Configure Sentry for the supplied DSN in your _*layout.tsx*_ file.

## Manual Install

If you don't use the Wizard, install the `@sentry/react-native` package:

```bash {tabTitle:Expo}
npx expo install @sentry/react-native
```

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install @sentry/react-native --save
```

```bash {tabTitle:yarn}
yarn add @sentry/react-native
```

```bash {tabTitle:pnpm}
pnpm add @sentry/react-native
```

### Intialize the SDK

Import the `@sentry/react-native` package and call `init` with your DSN:

```javascript {tabTitle:App.js or app/_layout.js}
import { Text, View } from "react-native";
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react-native";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___DSN___",

  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100%
  // of transactions for tracing.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production
  // Learn more at
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/options/#traces-sample-rate
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});

function App() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Expo Example!</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

export default Sentry.wrap(App);
```

### Wrap Your App

Wrap the root component of your application with `Sentry.wrap`:

```javascript {tabTitle:App.js or app/_layout.js}
export default Sentry.wrap(App);
```

### Add the Sentry Expo Plugin

To ensure bundles and source maps are automatically uploaded during the native applications builds, add `withSentry` to the Expo application configuration:

<Include name="react-native-expo-plugin-code-snippet.mdx" />

### Add Sentry Metro Plugin

To ensure unique Debug IDs get assigned to the generated bundles and source maps, add Sentry Serializer to the Metro configuration:

<Include name="react-native-expo-metro-plugin-code-snippet.mdx" />

### Add Privacy Manifest

The SDK needs access to certain information about the device and the application for its essential functionality. Some of the APIs required for this are considered privacy-relevant. Add the privacy manifest to your Xcode project to ensure your app is compliant with Apple's guidelines. Read the [Apple Privacy Manifest](/platforms/react-native/data-management/apple-privacy-manifest/) guide for more info on how to add records required for the Sentry SDKs.

## Verify Setup

To verify that everything is working as expected, build the `Release` version of your application and send a test event to Sentry by adding:

```javascript
<Button
  title="Try!"
  onPress={() => {
    Sentry.captureException(new Error("First error"));
  }}
/>
```

- [Add automatic tracing with Expo Router](/platforms/react-native/tracing/instrumentation/expo-router/)

## Notes

- Don't commit your auth token. Instead, use an environment variable like `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`.
- Source maps for the `Release` version of your application are uploaded automatically during the native application build.
- During development, the source code is resolved using the Metro Server and source maps aren't used. This currently doesn't work on web.
