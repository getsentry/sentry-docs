<Alert level="warning" title="Important">
Version 7 is still under development, the documentation may change before the final release.
</Alert>

The main goal of version 7 of the Sentry React Native SDK, is to bring compatibility with Sentry JavaScript version 9. This version is introducing breaking changes because of the JavaScript SDK dependency upgrade to version 9 and because we've removed deprecated APIs and restructured npm package contents.

## Important Changes In Dependencies

The Sentry React Native SDK ships with the Sentry JavaScript SDK as a dependency. The Sentry JavaScript SDK has been updated to version 9. This version includes a number of behavioral changes that will not be caught by type checkers, linters, or tests, so we recommend carefully reading through the entire migration guide instead of relying on automatic tooling. Please follow [the JavaScript migration guides](/platforms/javascript/guides/react/migration/v8-to-v9/) to complete the upgrade.

The initial `@sentry/react-native@7.0.0` ships with `@sentry/core@9.1.0`. Always use the exact JavaScript SDK version if adding it manually to your project. Any other version might not be compatible with the React Native SDK.

Version 7 also includes a major upgrade to the Android SDK dependency, introducing behavioral changes, breaking changes, and deprecations. If you are using the Android SDK directly, please follow the [Android SDK version 8 migration guide](/platforms/android/migration/#migrating-from-iosentrysentry-7x-to-iosentrysentry-800).

### General API Changes

Other general JavaScript SDK version 9 changes are described in the [JavaScript SDK 8.x to 9.x migration guide](/platforms/javascript/guides/react/migration/v8-to-v9/).

### Self-Hosted Sentry Compatibility

Beginning with version 7.0.0, the Sentry Capacitor SDK will only support self-hosted Sentry instances version 25.2.0 and above. This change does not affect users of `sentry.io`.

+    captureFeedback({
      name: 'my name',
