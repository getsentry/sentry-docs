This guide scribes how to migrate from `sentry-expo` to `@sentry/react-native` in your Expo application.

## Remove `sentry-expo`

First, remove `sentry-expo` from your dependencies:

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm uninstall sentry-expo
```

```bash {tabTitle:Yarn}
yarn remove sentry-expo
```

### Install `@sentry/react-native`

Install the `@sentry/react-native` package:

```bash {tabTitle:Expo}
npx expo install @sentry/react-native
```

```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install --save @sentry/react-native
```

```bash {tabTitle:Yarn}
yarn add @sentry/react-native
```

### Fix Imports

Replace all imports of `sentry-expo` with `@sentry/react-native`:

```diff {tabTitle:JavaScript}
- import * as Sentry from 'sentry-expo';
+ import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react-native';
```

Replace `sentry-expo` exports `Browser` and `React` with `@sentry/react`:

```diff {tabTitle:JavaScript}
- import { Browser, React } from 'sentry-expo';
+ import * as Browser from '@sentry/react';
+ import * as React from '@sentry/react';
```

Replace `sentry-expo` export `Native` with `@sentry/react-native`:

```diff {tabTitle:JavaScript}
- import { Native } from 'sentry-expo';
+ import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react-native';
```

### Review `Sentry.init` Options

The `enableInExpoDevelopment` option is no longer supported. If you were using it, remove it and replace it with a `__DEV__` check, or leave the SDK enabled in development.

```diff {tabTitle:JavaScript}
Sentry.init({
-  enableInExpoDevelopment: true,
+  enabled: __DEV__,
});
```

### Changes to Default Tags

Expo-specific tags are no longer added by default. If you were using them, you can add them manually:

```javascript
import Constants from "expo-constants";
import * as Device from "expo-device";
import * as Updates from "expo-updates";

import * as Sentry from "@sentry/react-native";

Sentry.setExtras({
  manifest,
  deviceYearClass: Device.deviceYearClass,
  linkingUri: Constants.linkingUri,
});

Sentry.setTag("expoReleaseChannel", Updates.manifest.releaseChannel);
Sentry.setTag("appVersion", Updates.manifest.version);
Sentry.setTag("appPublishedTime", Updates.manifest.publishedTime);
Sentry.setTag("expoSdkVersion", Updates.manifest.sdkVersion);
Sentry.setTag("deviceId", Constants.sessionId);
Sentry.setTag("appOwnership", Constants.appOwnership || "N/A");
if (Constants.appOwnership === "expo" && Constants.expoVersion) {
  setTag("expoAppVersion", Constants.expoVersion);
}
Sentry.setTag("expoChannel", Updates.channel);
```

## Review `react-native-web` Compatibility

The `sentry-expo` package automatically switched to `@sentry/react` for `react-native-web` builds. This is no longer the case with `@sentry/react-native` which supports `react-native-web` out of the box.

Note that some features might not be supported or work differently in `@sentry/react-native` on `react-native-web` compared to direct usage of `@sentry/react`. Verify in your application that the features you use work as expected.

To continue using `@sentry/react` for `react-native-web` builds, see [@sentry/react](/platforms/javascript/guides/react/) for more details about the web React package.

## Set Up the `@sentry/react-native` Expo and Metro Plugins

Next, [set up the Expo and Metro plugins](/platforms/react-native/manual-setup/expo/) for `@sentry/react-native`.
