Version 8 of the Sentry React Native SDK updates the underlying native SDKs (Cocoa v9, CLI v3, Android Gradle Plugin v6) which introduce breaking changes in minimum version requirements and build tooling.

## Important Changes in Dependencies

Version 8 includes major upgrades to the underlying native SDKs:

- **Cocoa SDK**: Upgraded from v8.58.0 to v9.1.0 ([#5356](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-react-native/pull/5356)). See the [Cocoa SDK 8.x to 9.x migration guide](/platforms/apple/migration/#migrating-from-8x-to-9x) for details on breaking changes.
- **Sentry CLI**: Upgraded from v2.58.4 to v3.1.0 ([#5523](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-react-native/pull/5523))
- **Android Gradle Plugin**: Upgraded to v6.0.0 ([#5578](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-react-native/pull/5578)). If you're using the Android SDK directly, see the [Android SDK migration guide](/platforms/android/migration/) for details.

These upgrades introduce breaking changes in minimum version requirements and build tooling.

## Breaking Changes

### Minimum Version Requirements

#### iOS/macOS/tvOS

The minimum supported versions have been updated:

- **iOS**: **15.0+** (previously 11.0+)
- **macOS**: **10.14+** (previously 10.13+)
- **tvOS**: **15.0+** (previously 11.0+)
- **Xcode**: **16.4+** (required)

If your app targets older versions, you'll need to update your deployment targets before upgrading to version 8.

**Note:** Xcode 16.4+ is required for proper Swift module compilation. Using older versions may result in build errors. Ensure your CI/CD environment uses Xcode 16.4 or later.

If you have custom `post_install` hooks in your `Podfile` that modify `SWIFT_VERSION` or other Swift compiler flags for all pods, exclude Sentry targets to avoid conflicts.

For more details on the Cocoa SDK v9 changes, see the [Cocoa SDK 8.x to 9.x migration guide](/platforms/apple/migration/#migrating-from-8x-to-9x).

#### Android

The Android build tooling requirements have been updated:

- **Sentry Android Gradle Plugin**: **6.0.0** (previously 5.x)
  - Drops support for Android Gradle Plugin 7.3.X and below
- **Android Gradle Plugin**: **7.4.0+** (previously 7.3.0+)
- **Kotlin**: **1.8+** (previously no minimum specified)

Update your `android/build.gradle` file to ensure compatibility. If you're using the Android SDK directly, see the [Android SDK migration guide](/platforms/android/migration/) for details:

```gradle
buildscript {
    ext {
        kotlinVersion = "1.8.0" // or higher
        androidGradlePluginVersion = "7.4.0" // or higher
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath("com.android.tools.build:gradle:$androidGradlePluginVersion")
        classpath("io.sentry:sentry-android-gradle-plugin:6.0.0")
    }
}
```

#### Sentry Self-Hosted

Sentry CLI v3 requires self-hosted Sentry instances version **25.11.1+** (previously 25.2.0).

If you're using a self-hosted Sentry instance, ensure it's running version 25.11.1 or higher before upgrading to React Native SDK v8.
