The only way to get accurate metrics is to measure performance overhead yourself. You can apply realistic access patterns against your own application, and correlate that to your own topline business metrics. You can learn more about the various optimizations implemented in the React Native Replay SDK in the [Replay Performance Overhead](/product/explore/session-replay/mobile/performance-overhead/) documentation.

The React Native Replay SDK is a lightweight wrapper around the native iOS and Android SDKs, so its overhead is negligible compared to the native SDKs, making it not worth separate measurement. Below are the benchmark results for each respective platform.

We measured the overhead using the [Pocket Casts iOS](https://github.com/Automattic/pocket-casts-ios) and [Pocket Casts Android](https://github.com/Automattic/pocket-casts-android) open-source apps respectively, which include a diverse set of components such as ViewControllers and SwiftUI screens. The benchmarks were conducted with full masking enabled, using optimized release builds, and running through the same user flow 10 times. This approach ensured the measurements closely reflect the overhead in a real-world application. Here are the results (median values are shown):

## iOS

| Metric                           | Sentry SDK only | Sentry + Replay SDK |
| -------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| FPS                              | 55 fps          | 53 fps              |
| Memory                           | 102 MB          | 121 MB              |
| CPU                              | 4%              | 13%                 |
| App Startup Time (Cold)          | 1264.80 ms      | 1265 ms             |
| Main Thread Time                 | -               | 43ms                |
| Network Bandwidth                | -               | 50 KB               |


The benchmarks were run on an iPhone 14 Pro.

## Android

| Metric                           | Sentry SDK only | Sentry + Replay SDK |
| -------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| FPS                              | 55 fps          | 54 fps              |
| Memory                           | 255 MB          | 265 MB              |
| CPU                              | 36%             | 42%                 |
| App Startup Time (Cold)          | 1533.35 ms      | 1539.55 ms          |
| Main Thread Time                 | -               | 20ms                |
| Network Bandwidth                | -               | 35 KB               |


The benchmarks were run on a Pixel 2XL with Android 11.
