<Note>

Mobile support for Session Replay is in Beta. Features available in Beta are still work-in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.

If you have any questions, feedback or would like to report a bug, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-react-native/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Platform%3A+React-Native%2CType%3A+%F0%9F%AA%B2+Bug&projects=&template=BUG_REPORT.md) with a link to a relevant replay in Sentry if possible.

</Note>

[Session Replay](/product/explore/session-replay/) helps you get to the root cause of an error or latency issue faster by providing you with a reproduction of what was happening in the user's device before, during, and after the issue. You can rewind and replay your application's state and see key user interactions, like taps, swipes, network requests, and console entries, in a single UI.

By default, our Session Replay SDK masks all text content, images, and user input, giving you heightened confidence that no sensitive data will leave the device. To learn more, see [product docs](/product/explore/session-replay/).

## Pre-requisites

Make sure your Sentry React Native SDK version is at least 5.26.0.

## Install

If you already have the SDK installed, you can update it to the latest version with:
```bash {tabTitle:npm}
npm install @sentry/react-native --save
```

```bash {tabTitle:yarn}
yarn add @sentry/react-native
```

```bash {tabTitle:pnpm}
pnpm add @sentry/react-native
```

## Set Up

To set up the integration, add the following to your Sentry initialization.

```javascript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react-native';

Sentry.init({
  dsn = "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  _experiments: {
    replaysSessionSampleRate: 1.0,
    replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,
  },
  integration: [
    Sentry.mobileReplayIntegration({
      maskAllText: true,
      maskAllImages: true,
    }),
  ],
});
```

<SignInNote />

## Verify

While you're testing, we recommend that you set <PlatformIdentifier name="replays-session-sample-rate" /> to `1.0`. This ensures that every user session will be sent to Sentry.

Once testing is complete, **we recommend lowering this value in production**. We still recommend keeping <PlatformIdentifier name="replays-on-error-sample-rate" /> set to `1.0`.

## Sampling

Sampling allows you to control how much of your website's traffic will result in a Session Replay. There are two sample rates you can adjust to get the replays relevant to you:

1. <PlatformIdentifier name="replays-session-sample-rate" /> - The sample rate for
   replays that begin recording immediately and last the entirety of the user's session.
2. <PlatformIdentifier name="replays-on-error-sample-rate" /> - The sample rate for
   replays that are recorded when an error happens. This type of replay will record
   up to a minute of events prior to the error and continue recording until the session
   ends.

Sampling begins as soon as a session starts. <PlatformIdentifier name="replays-session-sample-rate" /> is evaluated first. If it's sampled, the replay recording will begin. Otherwise, <PlatformIdentifier name="replays-on-error-sample-rate" /> is evaluated and if it's sampled, the integration will begin buffering the replay and will only upload it to Sentry if an error occurs. The remainder of the replay will behave similarly to a whole-session replay.

## Privacy

The SDK is recording and aggressively redacting all text and images. We plan to add fine controls for redacting, but in this version, we just allow either on or off. The default is on. Please donâ€™t turn it off if you have sensitive data in your app. Before the Beta is complete, we'll give you the controls you need.

<Note>

If you encounter any data not being redacted with the default settings, please let us know through a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-react-native/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Platform%3A+React-Native%2CType%3A+%F0%9F%AA%B2+Bug&projects=&template=BUG_REPORT.md).

</Note>

To disable redaction altogether (not to be used on applications with sensitive data):

```javascript
Sentry.mobileReplayIntegration({
  maskAllText: true,
  maskAllImages: true,
  maskAllVectors: true,
}),
```

## React Component Names

Sentry helps you capture your React components and unlock additional insights in your application. You can set it up to use React component names.

So instead of looking at this:

```html {tabTitle:Generic Components}
View > Touchable > View > Text
```

You can also see exactly which React component was used, like:

```html {tabTitle:React Components}
MyCard (View, MyCard.ts) > MyButton (Touchable, MyCard.ts) > View > Text
```

To add React Component Names use `annotateReactComponents` in `metro.config.js`.

```js {tabTitle: React Native}
const { getDefaultConfig } = require('@react-native/metro-config');
const { withSentryConfig } = require('@sentry/react-native/metro');
module.exports = withSentryConfig(getDefaultConfig(__dirname), { annotateReactComponents: true });
```

```js {tabTitle: Expo}
const { getSentryExpoConfig } = require("@sentry/react-native/metro");
const config = getSentryExpoConfig(__dirname, { annotateReactComponents: true });
```

## Error Linking

Errors that happen on the page while a replay is running will be linked to the replay, making it possible to jump between related issues and replays. However, it's **possible** that in some cases the error count reported on the **Replays Details** page won't match the actual errors that have been captured. That's because errors can be lost, and while this is uncommon, there are a few reasons why it could happen:

- The replay was rate-limited and couldn't be accepted.
- The replay was deleted by a member of your org.
- There were network errors and the replay wasn't saved.
