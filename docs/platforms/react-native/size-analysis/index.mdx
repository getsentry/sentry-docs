[Size Analysis](/product/size-analysis) helps monitor your mobile app's size in pre-production to prevent unexpected size increases (regressions) from reaching users. Aside from being courteous to your users, a smaller app size helps boost installation and retention rates, especially for customers with limited storage or slower connections.
