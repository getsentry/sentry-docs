If you don't see any profiling data in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io), you can try the following:

- Ensure that <PlatformLink to="/performance/">Tracing is enabled</PlatformLink>.
- Ensure that the automatic instrumentation is sending performance data to Sentry by going to the **Performance** page in [sentry.io](https://sentry.io).
- If the automatic instrumentation is not sending performance data, try using <PlatformLink to="/performance/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation">custom instrumentation</PlatformLink>.
- Enable <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#debug">debug mode</PlatformLink> in the SDK and check the logs.

### Limitations

Because profile samples are collected at a fixed sampling frequency, we recommend checking if profiling's [Performance Overhead](/product/profiling/performance-overhead) is acceptable for your use case. Note that
we're working on symbolication of the collected profiles which means that at the moment you'll see only function names but not resolved source file paths.

As always, and especially since Profiling in React Native is an alpha feature, feedback is welcome on [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/621778831602221064/750735628932612096) or [GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-react-native/issues/2668).
