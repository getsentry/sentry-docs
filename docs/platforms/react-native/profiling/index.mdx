## Enable Tracing

Profiling depends on Sentryâ€™s Tracing product being enabled beforehand. To enable tracing in the SDK:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___DSN___",
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

Check out the <PlatformLink to="/tracing/">tracing setup documentation</PlatformLink> for more detailed information on how to configure sampling. Setting the sample rate to 1.0 means all transactions will be captured.

## Enable Profiling

<Note>

Profiling for React Native is available in beta in SDK versions `5.8.0` and above.

</Note>

To enable profiling, set the `profilesSampleRate`:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___DSN___",
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  _experiments: {
    // profilesSampleRate is relative to tracesSampleRate.
    // Here, we'll capture profiles for 100% of transactions.
    profilesSampleRate: 1.0,
  },
});
```

### Options

To change the React Native profiling options add the `hermesProfilingIntegration` to the integrations in `Sentry.init`.

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  integrations: [
    Sentry.hermesProfilingIntegration({
      platformProfilers: false,
    }),
  ],
});
```

#### platformProfilers

Default value `true`, platform profilers are enabled. By default both React Native JS code executed in Hermes engine and platform specific code (Swift, Objective-C, Kotlin, Java) are profiled by their respective profilers. Setting `platformProfilers` to `false` will disable profiling of the platform specific code and only the JS code executed in Hermes will be profiled. This option is available since the SDK version [5.33.0](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-react-native/releases/tag/5.33.0).
