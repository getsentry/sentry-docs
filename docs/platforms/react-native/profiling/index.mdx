## Enable Tracing

Profiling depends on Sentry’s Tracing product being enabled beforehand. To enable tracing in the SDK:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___DSN___",
  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100% of transactions for tracing.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production.
  // Learn more at
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/options/#traces-sample-rate
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

Check out the <PlatformLink to="/tracing/">tracing setup documentation</PlatformLink> for more detailed information on how to configure sampling. Setting the sample rate to 1.0 means all transactions will be captured.

## Enable Profiling

<Alert>

Profiling for React Native is available in SDK versions `5.32.0` and above.

</Alert>

To enable profiling, set the `profilesSampleRate`:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___DSN___",
  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100% of transactions for tracing.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production.
  // Learn more at
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/options/#traces-sample-rate
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  // profilesSampleRate is relative to tracesSampleRate.
  // Here, we'll capture profiles for 100% of transactions.
  profilesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

### Options

To change the React Native profiling options add the `hermesProfilingIntegration` to the integrations in `Sentry.init`.

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  integrations: [
    Sentry.hermesProfilingIntegration({
      platformProfilers: false,
    }),
  ],
});
```

#### platformProfilers

Default value `true`, platform profilers are enabled. By default both React Native JS code executed in Hermes engine and platform specific code (Swift, Objective-C, Kotlin, Java) are profiled by their respective profilers. Setting `platformProfilers` to `false` will disable profiling of the platform specific code and only the JS code executed in Hermes will be profiled. This option is available since the SDK version [5.33.0](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-react-native/releases/tag/5.33.0).
