Sentry automatically tracks unhandled promise rejections in React Native applications. Since version `6.15.0` the SDK uses engine-specific implementations to ensure reliable tracking across different JavaScript engines including Hermes, JavaScriptCore (JSC), and React Native Web environments.

## Configuration

Promise rejection tracking is enabled by default when you initialize Sentry. You can control promise rejection tracking through the `reactNativeErrorHandlersIntegration`:

```javascript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react-native';

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [
    Sentry.reactNativeErrorHandlersIntegration({
      onunhandledrejection: false, // Disables promise rejection tracking
    }),
  ],
});
```

## Engine-Specific Behavior

### Hermes Engine

When using Hermes, Sentry uses the engine's native promise rejection tracking capabilities.

<Alert>

Enabling Hermes rejection tracking will overwrite existing hooks due to limitations of the engine. Only one promise rejection tracker can be active at a time.

</Alert>

### JavaScriptCore (JSC)

For JSC environments, Sentry uses Promise polyfill with rejection tracking capabilities. This approach also overwrites existing hooks.

<Alert>

The Promise polyfill is used to ensure compatibility and provide rejection tracking functionality that may not be available natively in older JSC versions.

</Alert>

### React Native Web

For React Native Web, Sentry leverages the browser's native promise rejection tracking capabilities, providing seamless integration with web debugging tools.

## Multiple Tools and Logging

When using multiple tools for promise rejection tracking, be aware that:

- **Hermes**: Only one rejection tracker can be active. Sentry will take precedence.
- **JSC**: Sentry's Promise polyfill will override existing handlers.
- **React Native Web**: Can coexist better with other browser-based debugging tools.

### Example: Using Sentry with Other Debugging Tools

```javascript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react-native';

// For development, you might want to disable Sentry's tracking
// to allow other debugging tools to handle promise rejections
if (__DEV__) {
  Sentry.init({
    dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    integrations: [
      Sentry.reactNativeErrorHandlersIntegration({
        onunhandledrejection: false, // Let other tools handle in development
      }),
    ],
  });
} else {
  // In production, use Sentry's tracking
  Sentry.init({
    dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
    // Default configuration with promise tracking enabled
  });
}
```

## Troubleshooting

Due to an issue with React Native's dependencies, unhandled promise rejections might not be correctly caught by Sentry when using the JavaScriptCore (JSC) engine or a React Native SDK version before `6.15.0`.

If the promise rejection handler was not correctly attached, our SDK might issue a warning:

> WARN: Unhandled promise rejections might not be caught by Sentry. Read about how to fix this on our troubleshooting docs.

Otherwise, we will let you know that the handler is attached:

> [Sentry] Unhandled promise rejections will be caught by Sentry.

### Auto Patching (Default Behavior)

By default we will patch the global `Promise` instance to ensure it matches exactly with the version that React Native uses.

#### Using With Other Polyfills

If you use a polyfilling library that patches the global `Promise` instance, you'll need to make sure you run the polyfill **after** `Sentry.init` is called.


```javascript
import allSettled from "promise.allsettled";

Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
});
// Any Promise polyfilling must occur AFTER Sentry.init
// This step globally patches Promise.
allSettled.shim();

// Separate core-js example
import "core-js/stable/promise/all-settled";
```

Your linter might throw some errors here, but this step is necessary.

#### Disable Auto Patching

You can disable the global promise patching by passing `patchGlobalPromise: false` in either `Sentry.init` or the `ReactNativeErrorHandlers` integration. Note that if you disable our auto patching, to ensure that unhandled rejections are still caught, you will need to [manually force a package resolution](#manually-forcing-a-package-resolution).

### Manually Forcing a Package Resolution

You don't need to perform the steps below if you don't disable [auto patching](#auto-patching-default-behavior). You'll need to ensure that the version of `promise` that you use matches exactly with the version that React Native uses.

1. Check the version of `promise` that your version of `react-native` uses. You can do this by going into `node_modules/react-native/package.json` and checking the version there, for example we find that it uses `^8.0.3`:

```json {filename:node_modules/react-native/package.json}
{
  "dependencies": {
    // ...
    "promise": "^8.0.3"
  }
}
```

2. Add a package resolution with the same version as `react-native`'s' to **your** `package.json` file, this will force this version to be used. You will then need to run a fresh `yarn install` or `npm install` to use the package resolution you just added.

```json {filename:package.json}
{
  "resolutions": {
    "promise": "^8.0.3"
  }
}
```

<Alert>

Package resolutions are currently only supporred by `yarn`. If you use `npm`, you can use a third-party package called [npm-force-resolutions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-force-resolutions) to achieve this.

</Alert>

3. If the fix is successful, our SDK will no longer display the above warning and will indicate that promise rejections will be caught.


## Migration from Older Versions

If you're upgrading from an older version of Sentry React Native:

1. Remove any manual Promise polyfill resolutions from your `package.json`
2. Remove any custom promise rejection handling code
3. Update to the latest version of `@sentry/react-native`
4. Test that promise rejections are being captured correctly

The new engine-specific approach should resolve previous compatibility issues automatically.
