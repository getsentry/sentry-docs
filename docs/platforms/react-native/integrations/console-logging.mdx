<Alert level="info" title="Sentry Logs">

Enable the Sentry Logs feature with `enableLogs: true` in your `Sentry.init` call to unlock Sentry's full logging power. With Sentry Logs, you can search, filter, and analyze logs from across your entire application in one place.

</Alert>

Console Logging integration is enabled by default which means calls to the `console` API will be captured as logs in Sentry. By default the integration instruments `console.debug`, `console.info`, `console.warn`, `console.error`, `console.log`, `console.trace`, and `console.assert`.

## Disabling Console Logging Integration

To disable the integration, filter it out from the integrations array:

```js
Sentry.init({
  ...,
  integrations(integrations) {
    return integrations.filter(i => i.name !== 'ConsoleLogs');
  },
  ...
})
```

You can also filter out the automatically captured logs in `beforeSendLog`:

```js
Sentry.init({
  ...,
  beforeSendLog: (log) => {
    if (log.attributes?.['sentry.origin'] === 'auto.log.console') {
      return null;
    }
    return log;
  },
  ...
})
```
