In addition to the integrations that come with the SDK, you can also write custom integrations.

Custom integration must conform to the [Integration interface](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/master/packages/types/src/integration.ts).

A custom integration can be created and added to the SDK as follows:

```javascript
function myAwesomeIntegration() {
  return {
    name: "MyAwesomeIntegration",
    setup(client) {
      // Do something when the SDK is initialized
      // The client that is being setup is passed to the hook
    },
  };
}

Sentry.init({
  // ...
  integrations: [myAwesomeIntegration()],
});
```

All hooks on an integration are optional. The only required field is the `name`. You can use one or multiple of the following hooks in a custom integration:

### `setup`

The `setup` hook is called when the SDK is initialized. It receives the client instance as an argument.
You should use this if you want to run some code upon initialization.

```javascript
const integration = {
  name: "MyAwesomeIntegration",
  setup(client) {
    setupCustomSentryListener(client);
  },
};
```

### `processEvent`

This hook can be used to modify events before they're sent to Sentry. It receives the event as an argument and should return the modified event. The hook also receives a hint object that may hold additional event metadata, as well as the client that's sending the event. You can also return `null` to drop the event from being sent.

```javascript
const integration = {
  name: "MyAwesomeIntegration",
  processEvent(event, hint, client) {
    event.extra = {
      ...event.extra,
      myCustomTag: "value",
    };
    // Return the modified event,
    // or return `null` to drop the event
    return event;
  },
};
```

You can also return a promise that resolves with an event or `null`. However, this is not recommended and should be avoided wherever possible, because it can delay event sending.

### `preprocessEvent`

This hook is similar to `processEvent`, but it's called before the event is passed to any other `processEvent` hook. It can be used in places where the order of processing is important.

You can use `processEvent` for most cases, but only when you need to ensure that your hook is called before any other `processEvent` hook use `preprocessEvent`.

Similar to `processEvent`, this hook receives the event, hint, and client as arguments. However, this hook won't allow the return of a modified event or `null` to drop the event. You can only mutate the passed in event in this hook:

```javascript
const integration = {
  name: "MyAwesomeIntegration",
  preprocessEvent(event, hint, client) {
    event.extra = {
      ...event.extra,
      myCustomTag: "value",
    };
    // Nothing to return, just mutate the event
  },
};
```

### `setupOnce`

This hook is similar to `setup`, but it's only run once, even if the SDK is re-initialized. It won't receive any arguments. We recommend that you use `setup` instead. The only reason to use `setupOnce` is when you may be calling `Sentry.init()` multiple times and you want to ensure a certain piece of code is only run once.

```javascript
const integration = {
  name: "MyAwesomeIntegration",
  setupOnce() {
    wrapLibrary();
  },
};
```

### `afterAllSetup`

While we recommend that you use the `setup` hook in most cases, `afterAllSetup` can be used to make sure that all other integrations have been run. This hook receives the `client` that is being set up as the first argument and is triggered after `setupOnce()` and `setup()` have been called for all integrations. 


```javascript
const integration = {
  name: "MyAwesomeIntegration",
  afterAllSetup(client) {
    // We can be sure that all other integrations
    // have run their `setup` and `setupOnce` hooks now
    startSomeThing(client);
  },
};
```
