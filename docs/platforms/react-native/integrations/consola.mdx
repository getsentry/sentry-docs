<Alert level="info" title="Sentry Logs">

Enable the Sentry Logs feature with `enableLogs: true` in your `Sentry.init` call to unlock Sentry's full logging power. With Sentry Logs, you can search, filter, and analyze logs from across your entire application in one place.

</Alert>

In SDK version `10.12.0` and above, you can send logs to Sentry via the [consola](https://github.com/unjs/consola) logging library.

```js
import { consola } from "consola";

// Create a Sentry reporter for consola
const sentryReporter = Sentry.createConsolaReporter();

// Add the reporter to consola
consola.addReporter(sentryReporter);
```

The `createConsolaReporter` method accepts a `levels` option, which allows you to filter which levels are sent to Sentry. By default all levels are logged.

```js
const sentryReporter = Sentry.createConsolaReporter({
  levels: ["error", "warn"],
});
```
