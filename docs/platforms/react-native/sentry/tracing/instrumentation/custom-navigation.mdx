Sentry's React Native SDK package ships with instrumentation for [React Navigation](/platforms/react-native/tracing/instrumentation/react-navigation/), [React Native Navigation](/platforms/react-native/tracing/instrumentation/react-native-navigation/), and [Expo Router](/platforms/react-native/tracing/instrumentation/expo-router/). This allows you to see the performance of your navigation transitions and the errors that may occur.

If you use a navigation library that we don't yet support, or have a custom routing solution, you can use `startIdleNavigationSpan` function to implement your own navigation integration. This page will guide you through setting it up and configuring it to your needs.

```javascript {filename: customNavigationIntegration.js}
import Sentry from '@sentry/react-native';

const customNavigationIntegration = ({navigator}) => {
  navigator.registerRouteChangeListener((newRoute) => {
    Sentry.startIdleNavigationSpan({
      name: newRoute.name,
      op: 'navigation'
    })
  });

  return {
    name: "CustomNavigation",
  };
};

Sentry.init({
  dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
  // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100% of transactions for tracing.
  // We recommend adjusting this value in production.
  // Learn more at
  // https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/options/#traces-sample-rate
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  integrations: [customNavigationIntegration({navigator})],
});
```
