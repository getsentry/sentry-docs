Sentry's React Native SDK package ships with instrumentation for [React Navigation](/platforms/react-native/performance/instrumentation/react-navigation/) and [React Native Navigation](/platforms/react-native/performance/instrumentation/react-native-navigation/). This allows you to see the performance of your navigation transitions and the errors that occur during them.

If you use a navigation library that we don't yet support, or have a custom routing solution, you can use the basic `RoutingInstrumentation`. This page will guide you through setting it up and configuring it to your needs.

## Bare Bones

Every routing instrumentation revolves around one method:

`onRouteWillChange` (context: TransactionContext): Transaction | undefined

You need to ensure that this method is called **before** the route change occurs, and an `IdleTransaction` is created and set on the scope.

```javascript
// Construct a new instrumentation instance. This is needed to communicate between the integration and React
const routingInstrumentation = new Sentry.RoutingInstrumentation();

Sentry.init({
  ...
  integrations: [
    new Sentry.ReactNativeTracing({
      // Pass instrumentation to be used as `routingInstrumentation`
      routingInstrumentation,
      ...
    }),
  ],
})

const App = () => {
  <SomeNavigationLibrary
    onRouteWillChange={(newRoute) => {
        // Call this before the route changes
      routingInstrumentation.onRouteWillChange({
        name: newRoute.name,
        op: 'navigation'
      })
    }}
  />
};
```

## Custom Instrumentation

To create a custom routing instrumentation, look at how the `RoutingInstrumentation` class [is implemented](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-react-native/blob/211ec081b6bf8d7d29541afe9d800040f61e3c4e/src/js/tracing/routingInstrumentation.ts). If you need an example of how to implement routing instrumentation, review the code of the existing official instrumentation such as [the one for React Navigation V4](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-react-native/blob/211ec081b6bf8d7d29541afe9d800040f61e3c4e/src/js/tracing/reactnavigationv4.ts)

```javascript
class CustomInstrumentation extends RoutingInstrumentation {
  constructor(navigator) {
    super();

    this.navigator.registerRouteChangeListener(this.routeListener.bind(this));
  }

  routeListener(newRoute) {
    // Again, ensure this is called BEFORE the route changes and BEFORE the route is mounted.
    this.onRouteWillChange({
      name: newRoute.name,
      op: "navigation",
    });
  }
}
```
