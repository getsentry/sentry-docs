## User Feedback API

The user feedback API allows you to collect user feedback while utilizing your own UI. You can use the same programming language you have in your app to send user feedback. In this case, the SDK creates the HTTP request so you don't have to deal with posting data via HTTP.

Sentry pairs the feedback with the original event, giving you additional insight into issues. Sentry needs the `eventId` to be able to associate the user feedback to the corresponding event. For example, to get the `eventId`, you can use <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/#before-send"><PlatformIdentifier name="before-send" /></PlatformLink> or the return value of the method capturing an event.

<PlatformContent includePath="user-feedback/sdk-api-example/" />
