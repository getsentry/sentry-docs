Agent skills are instruction sets that teach AI coding assistants how to perform specific tasks. Sentry's official agent skills give your AI assistant the knowledge to set up and configure Sentry in your projects with no manual configuration required. Use [workflow skills](/ai/agent-skills/#workflow-skills) to debug and fix issues in your projects.

<StepComponent>

## Available Skills
There are two types of official Sentry agent skills: 

- **Setup skills** - Set up Sentry in your projects with no manual configuration required.
- **Workflow skills** - Debug and fix issues in your projects.

Check out the latest and full list of skills [here](https://skills.sh/getsentry/sentry-agent-skills).

## Install

Run this in your project (or from any directory for user-level install) to add Sentry agent skills. Omit `--skill` to add all skills from the repo.

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-agent-skills --skill sentry-fix-issues
```

To add all Sentry skills:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-agent-skills
```

## Quick Reference

Paths where each client looks for skills: **user-level** (all your projects) and **project-level** (current repository only).

| Client          | User-Level Path             | Project-Level Path |
| --------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Claude Code** | `~/.claude/skills/`         | `.claude/skills/`  |
| **Codex**       | `~/.codex/skills/`          | `.codex/skills/`   |
| **Copilot**     | `~/.copilot/skills/`        | `.github/skills/`  |
| **Cursor**      | `~/.cursor/skills/`         | `.cursor/skills/`  |

## Usage

Once installed, your AI assistant will automatically discover the skills. Simply ask it to perform Sentry-related tasks:

## Contributing

Want to contribute a new skill? Skills follow the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification). Here's what one looks like:


Each skill is a folder with a `SKILL.md` file. The file has YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`) and markdown instructions the AI assistant will use.

```text
skill-name/
  SKILL.md        # Required: YAML frontmatter + markdown instructions
```

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: Description of what this skill does and when to use it
---

# Skill Title

Instructions for the AI assistant...
```

**Requirements:**

1. Follow the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification)
2. Have a valid `name` (lowercase, hyphens, 1-64 characters)
3. Include a clear `description` (1-1024 characters)
4. **Keep skills concise** — use tables over prose, avoid obvious information
5. Include an "Invoke This Skill When" section with trigger phrases
6. Verify technical details against Sentry docs

### Style Guidelines

- Prefer tables over paragraphs for reference information
- Use phases/steps for multi-stage workflows
- Include version requirements where applicable
- Add troubleshooting tables for common issues
- Target ~100-200 lines per skill to minimize token usage
