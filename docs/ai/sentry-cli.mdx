The [Sentry CLI](https://cli.sentry.dev) is a command-line tool built for developers and AI agents. It auto-detects your project from `.env` files and the local codebase, so you don't need config files or flags. Type natural commands, investigate issues, get AI-powered root cause analysis from [Seer](/product/ai-in-sentry/seer/), and manage your Sentry projects directly from the terminal.

For full documentation, visit [cli.sentry.dev](https://cli.sentry.dev).

## Installation

Install the CLI using the install script:

```bash
curl https://cli.sentry.dev/install -fsS | bash
```

Or install globally with a package manager:

```bash {tabTitle: npm}
npm install -g sentry
```

```bash {tabTitle: pnpm}
pnpm add -g sentry
```

```bash {tabTitle: yarn}
yarn global add sentry
```

```bash {tabTitle: bun}
bun add -g sentry
```

You can also run it directly without installing:

```bash {tabTitle: npx}
npx sentry --help
```

```bash {tabTitle: pnpm dlx}
pnpm dlx sentry --help
```

## Authentication

Authenticate using the OAuth device flow:

```bash
sentry auth login
```

You'll receive a URL and code to enter in your browser. Once authorized, the CLI stores your credentials automatically.

You can also authenticate with an API token directly:

```bash
sentry auth login --token YOUR_SENTRY_API_TOKEN
```

Create API tokens in your [Sentry account settings](https://sentry.io/settings/account/api/auth-tokens/).

## Key Commands

The CLI auto-detects your project context, so most commands work without specifying a project or organization.

### List Issues

```bash
sentry issue list
```

### Investigate an Issue

Get AI-powered root cause analysis from Seer:

```bash
sentry issue explain <short-id>
```

### Get a Fix Plan

Generate a step-by-step fix you can apply:

```bash
sentry issue plan <short-id>
```

### Browse Projects and Organizations

```bash
sentry project list
sentry org list
```

### Structured Output

Every command supports JSON output for scripting and pipelines:

```bash
sentry org list --json | jq '.[0]'
```

## Agentic Usage

AI coding agents like Claude Code can use the Sentry CLI through the agent skill system. This allows agents to list issues, inspect events, and interact with Sentry from your development environment.

Add the Sentry CLI skill to your agent:

```bash
npx skills add https://cli.sentry.dev
```

The agent uses your existing CLI authentication, so run `sentry auth login` first.

For more details on agentic usage, see the [Agentic Usage guide on cli.sentry.dev](https://cli.sentry.dev/agentic-usage).
