The Sentry web API is used to access the Sentry platform programmatically. You can use the APIs to manage account-level resources, like organizations and teams, as well as manage and export data.

If you're looking for information about the API surface for Sentry's SDKs, see the [SDK Development](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/overview/) docs.

## Versioning

Sentry's web API is **v0** and under development. Public endpoints, especially those marked as beta may change.

## Getting Started

- [Pagination](/api/pagination/)
- [Permissions](/api/permissions/)
- [Rate Limits](/api/ratelimits)

- [Tutorial: Create a Sentry Authentication Token](/api/guides/create-auth-token/)
- [Tutorial: Create and List Teams with the Sentry API](/api/guides/teams-tutorial/)

## Choosing the Right API Base Domain

While many of our APIs use `sentry.io` as the host for API endpoints, if
you want to indicate a specific [data storage location](/organization/data-storage-location/#what-types-of-data-are-stored-where), you should use region-specific domains.

- US region is hosted on `us.sentry.io`
- DE region is hosted on `de.sentry.io`.

To find out which API resources are available on region-based domains, see [what
types of data are stored
where](/organization/data-storage-location/#what-types-of-data-are-stored-where) for more information.
