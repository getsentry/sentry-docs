title: API Reference
---

The Sentry web API is used to access the Sentry platform programmatically. You can use the APIs to manage account-level resources, like organizations and teams, as well as manage and export data.

If you're looking for information about the API surface for Sentry's SDKs, see the [SDK Development](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/overview/) docs.

## Versioning

Sentry's web API is **v0** and under development. Public endpoints, especially those marked as beta may change.

## Getting Started

- [Sentry Postman Collection](https://www.postman.com/sentryio)

- [Pagination](/api/pagination/)
- [Permissions](/api/permissions/)
- [Rate Limits](/api/ratelimits)

- [Tutorial: Create a Sentry Authentication Token](/api/guides/create-auth-token/)
- [Tutorial: Create and List Teams with the Sentry API](/api/guides/teams-tutorial/)

## Finding the API base domain

While many of the API examples use `sentry.io` as the host for API endpoints, if
you want to take advantage of [data storage location](https://docs.sentry.io/organization/data-storage-location/#what-types-of-data-are-stored-where) you should use the region
specific domains instead.

- US region is hosted on `us.sentry.io`
- DE region is hosted on `de.sentry.io`.

To find out which API resources are available on region base domains see [what
types of data are stored
where](https://docs.sentry.io/organization/data-storage-location/#what-types-of-data-are-stored-where) for more information.
