Pagination in the API is handled via the Link header standard:

```bash
curl -i https://sentry.io/api/0/organizations/acme/projects/1/groups/
```

```http
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Date: Sat, 14 Feb 2015 18:47:20 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Language: en
Allow: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS
Link: <https://sentry.io/api/0/organizations/acme/projects/1/groups/?&cursor=1420837590:0:1>;
  rel="previous"; results="false",
  <https://sentry.io/api/0/organizations/acme/projects/1/groups/?&cursor=1420837533:0:0>;
  rel="next"; results="true"
```

When supported, cursors will **always** be returned for both a previous and a next page, even if there are no results on these pages. This allows you to make a query against the API for yet-undiscovered results. An example where this would be used is when you're implementing polling behavior and you want to see if there is any new data. We return a `results="[true|false]"` indicator to determine if you actually need to paginate.

## Pagination Example

Here is a pagination example using this API endpoint:

https://docs.sentry.io/api/events/list-an-issues-events/

The HTTP request in this example returns 100 events for the issue and has the following link header in the response:

```bash {tabTitle:Http}
<https://sentry.io/api/0/organizations/acme/issues/123456/events/?&cursor=0:0:1>; rel="previous"; results="false"; cursor="0:0:1", <https://sentry.io/api/0/organizations/acme/issues/123456/events/?&cursor=0:100:0>; rel="next"; results="true"; cursor="0:100:0"
```

One of the URLs in the link response has `rel=next`, which indicates the next results page. It also has `results=true`, which means that there are more results.

Based on this, the next request is `GET <https://sentry.io/api/0/organizations/acme/issues/123456/events/?&cursor=0:100:0>`.

This request will return the next 100 events for that issue, again, with the following link header:

```bash {tabTitle:Http}
<https://sentry.io/api/0/organizations/acme/issues/123456/events/?&cursor=0:0:1>; rel="previous"; results="true"; cursor="0:0:1", <https://sentry.io/api/0/organizations/acme/issues/123456/events/?&cursor=0:200:0>; rel="next"; results="true"; cursor="0:200:0"
```

The process is repeated until the URL with `rel=next` has the flag `results=false` to indicate the last page.

The three values from cursor are: cursor identifier (integer, usually 0), row offset, and is_prev (1 or 0).
