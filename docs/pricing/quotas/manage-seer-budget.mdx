<Alert>
  [Seer](/product/ai-in-sentry/seer/) is only available when added to an existing Team or Business plan. Once Seer has been added, each [active contributor](#key-terms) will be charged at $40 per seat. Counts reset at the end of each month.
</Alert>

## Key Terms

- **Seer**: Sentry's AI debugging agent that catches breaking changes before deploy, and debugs and fixes issues in production.

- **Active Contributor**: any user who makes 2 or more PRs on a Seer-connected repository. Users who contribute to more than one connected repository will still count as only one seat.

## Tips for Managing Spend

Seer usage is billed separately as its own monthly charge and does not deduct from your pay-as-you-go budget. To avoid unexpected bills, keep an eye on the following:

- Manage Seer-Connected Repositories: Only active contributors on Seer-connected repos get counted towards your Seer invoice. To see which repos are connected to Seer, navigate to your organization's [settings](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/settings/seer/).

- Monitor Your Usage: Regularly check your connected repos and active contributors to avoid unexpected bills.

## Example Scenario

Let's illustrate how this works:

You have a total of 10 GitHub repositories, 5 of which are connected to Seer. Across the 5 Seer-connected repos, there are a total of 10 users who have made 2 or more PRs within the monthly billing period. At the end of the billing period, you will be charged a total of $400 (10 active contributors x $40).

In the next billing period, you continue to have 5 Seer-connected repositories but only 3 users made 2 or more PRs. At the end of the monthly billing period, you will be charged a total of $120 (3 active contributors x $40).
