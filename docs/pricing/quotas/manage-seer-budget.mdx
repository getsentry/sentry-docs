<Alert>
  [Seer](/product/ai-in-sentry/seer/) is only available when purchased
  additionally while on a Team or Business plan. Once Seer has been purchased,
  your subscription will have $25 worth of Seer budget to be used across issue
  scans and issue fixes.
</Alert>

## Key Terms

- **Seer Budget**: The initial budget your subscription has allocated to be used exclusively by Seer products. This includes issue scans and issue fixes.

- **Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) Budget**: A budget you set to pay for additional issue scans and fixes beyond your Seer budget.

- **Issue Scan**: An analysis of an issue to help determine fixability. These scans are run automatically for every new error and performance issue.

- [**Issue Fix**](/product/ai-in-sentry/seer/issue-fix/): A root cause and solution generated for an issue. You will only be charged one fix per issue, however if you "Start Over" your fix, this will count as a new fix and will be charged accordingly.

- [**Seer Automation**](/product/ai-in-sentry/seer/#automation): Settings that combine issue scans and fixes into a powerful workflow: identifying actionable issues in real time and generating high quality fixes automatically. These options help manage Seer and PAYG spend by letting you choose to whether run scans, which issues trigger fixes, and how far fixes progress (from root cause analysis to opening a pull request).

## Before You Begin: Check Your Seer Usage

You can look at your Seer usage in the [Usage Stats tab](/product/stats/#usage-stats) to understand the breakdown of your issue fixes and issue scans by time window and project. This may help you figure out where you need to further fine-tune your usage.

This page is accessible to all members of your organization, so Owners in your Sentry org will be able to share it with the developers directly responsible for a given project. You'll also be able to use this page to assess whether your changes are working as intended.

### How Can I See a Breakdown of Incoming Issue Scans and Fixes?

The Usage Stats tab displays details about the total amount of data Sentry has received across your entire org for up to 90 days. The page breaks down the events by project into three categories: accepted, dropped, or filtered. Only accepted scans and fixes affect your budget:

### Which Projects Are Consuming My Seer Spend?

The "All Projects" table on the Stats page breaks down your data by project, so you can identify the ones that are consuming the most budget. Clicking on the settings icon next to a project name in the table will open that project's settings page, where you can manage its Seer scan and automatic analysis settings.

## Adjusting PAYG Budget

Budgets can only be updated by a Billing- or Owner-level member of your Sentry org.

Once your Seer budget is approaching or has exceeded its included budget, teammates with "Owner" org permissions will start receiving [notification](/product/alerts/notifications/#quota-notifications) emails. They'll then be able to choose to increase or decrease the PAYG budget to unlock additional usage.

### Increasing Seer Budget

If Issue Scans have stopped running or you're not able to initiate new Issue Fixes because you've exceeded your Seer budget, you can add to your budget at any time during your billing period by increasing your PAYG budget. This is ideal in situations where you're rolling out a new version of your application, for example. To add PAYG budget, set a monthly maximum shared budget in your [Subscriptions Page](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/settings/billing).

## Tips for Managing Spend

- Manage Automation Settings: Automation of issue scans and fixes will be the primary driver to Seer spend. Make sure you understand how automation may increase or decrease the number of scans and fixes across your projects.

- Adust Budget as Needed: If you anticipate needing more issue scans or fixes, consider increasing your PAYG budget beforehand.

- Monitor Your Usage: Regularly check your [Seer usage](/product/stats/#usage-stats) and PAYG budget to avoid unexpected bills.

### Seer Fix and Scan Automation Settings

Adjusting automation ensures issues are consistently ready for review, while also helping you manage your Seer and PAYG budget. Automation in Seer is the set of controls that determine how issues are automatically scanned, flagged, and fixed across your projects. Located in **Settings > Seer Automation**, these settings let you:

    - Enable or disable automatic issue scans: Seer will scan all new and ongoing issues, flagging the  most actionable ones, enriching Slack alerts with additional context, and preparing issues for automated fixes.

    - Customize auto-triggered fixes: Choose to trigger fixes for all issues or only the most actionable, and refine the stopping point--from generating a root cause analysis to drafting a solution, or even opening a pull request automatically.

Automation will run based on available Seer or PAYG budget. Once both budgets have depleted, Seer will stop running issue scans and fixes unless additional budget is made available or the billing cycle resets.

If you find that you're running out of your Seer or PAYG budget too quickly, you can double-check your project's Seer automation settings. To ensure new projects are in check, you can also update the default settings for new projects. For more details on choosing the right automation settings for you, visit the [Automation Settings docs](/product/ai-in-sentry/seer/#automation).

## Example Scenario

Let's illustrate how this works:

1. **Seer Budget:**
   - By purchasing Seer, you get $25 of Seer credit each month. This credit is dedicated to Seer usage (issue scans and fixes).
   - You also have added $100 to your shared PAYG budget that covers all Sentry events, including any Seer usage that exceeds your monthly credit.
2. **Issue Scans:**
   - Automatic issue scans is enabled, meaning every new issue created triggers a scan automatically.
   - In this billing cycle, let's suppose 1,000 new issues are created, which means 1,000 scans are run.
   - The total issue scan cost is $3. 
3. **Issue Fixes:**
   - Your issue fix automation is set to "Highly Actionable and Above".
   - Of the 1,000 issues scanned, 50 are identified as "Highly Actionable and Above". As soon as the issue is classified, Seer automatically creates RCAs and suggested fixes for these 50 issues so that they are immediately available for your review.
   - The total issue fix cost is $50.
4. **Seer Invoice:**

   - Total Seer usage: $3 (scans) + $50 (fixes) = $53.
   - $25 is covered by your monthly Seer Credit.
   - The remaining $28 is charged to your shared PAYG budget, alongside any other Sentry event overages.

   By understanding how Seer automation and billing works, you can effectively manage your Seer budget and usage.
