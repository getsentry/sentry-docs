## Key Terms

- **Seer**: Sentry’s AI debugger includes root cause analysis, autofix, and code review. 

- *Active Contributor**: any user who opens 2 or more PRs on a Seer-connected repository.


## Tips for Managing Spend

- Manage Seer-Connected Repositories: Only active contributors on Seer-connected repos get counted towards your Seer invoice. To see which repos are connected to Seer, navigate to your organization’s [settings](https://sentry.io/settings/seer/). 

- Monitor Your Usage: Regularly check your connected repos and active contributors to avoid unexpected bills.


## Example Scenario

Let's illustrate how this works:

You have a total of 10 GitHub repositories, 5 of which are connected to Seer. Across the 5 Seer-connected repos, there are a total of 10 users who have opened 2 or more PRs within the billing period. At the end of the billing period, you will be charged a total of $400 (10 active contributors x $40). 

In the next billing period, you continue to have 5 Seer-connected repositories but only 3 users who opened 2 or more PRs. At the end of the billing period, you will be charged a total of $120 (3 active contributors x $40).
