description: Use AI agents to help implement Sentry in your applications

Sentry documentation is available as an agent skill, enabling AI coding assistants to help you implement Sentry in your applications.

## What This Provides

The `sentry-docs` skill gives AI agents access to:

- **SDK setup guides** for all supported platforms and frameworks
- **Feature documentation** for tracing, session replay, logs, crons, and more
- **Configuration references** for sampling, filtering, and customization
- **Troubleshooting guides** for common issues

## Adding the Skill

If you're using [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) or another agent that supports the [Agent Skills Discovery](https://github.com/cloudflare/agent-skills-discovery-rfc) protocol:

```bash
npx skills add https://docs.sentry.io
```

This registers the Sentry documentation skill with your AI agent.

## Example Use Cases

Once added, your AI agent can help with:

- "Set up Sentry error monitoring in my Next.js app"
- "Add distributed tracing to my FastAPI backend"
- "Configure sampling to reduce my Sentry volume"
- "Why aren't my errors showing up in Sentry?"
- "Add session replay to capture user interactions"

The agent will fetch the relevant documentation and provide implementation guidance specific to your stack.

## Manual Access

If your AI tool doesn't support skills discovery, you can still access documentation directly:

- Append `.md` to any docs URL for markdown: `https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs.md`
- Use the [skill files](/.well-known/skills/index.json) as context for your AI assistant
