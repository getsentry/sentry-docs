Breadcrumbs Interface
=====================

The breadcrumbs interface specifies a series of application events, or "breadcrumbs",
that occurred before the main event.

The value of the interface is an array of breadcrumb objects. Breadcrumb entries are
ordered from oldest to newest. The last breadcrumb in the array should be the last
entry before the main event fired.

Each breadcrumb has a few properties of which at least ``timestamp``
and ``category`` must be provided.  The rest is optional and depending on what
is provided the rendering might be different.

``timestamp``
  A timestamp representing when the breadcrumb occurred. This can be either an ISO datetime string,
  or a Unix timestamp.
``type``
  The type of breadcrumb. The default type is ``default`` which indicates
  no specific handling.  Other types are currently ``http`` for HTTP
  requests and ``navigation`` for navigation events.  More about types
  later.
``message``
  If a message is provided it's rendered as text and the whitespace is
  preserved.  Very long text might be abbreviated in the UI.
``data``
  Data associated with this breadcrumb. Contains a sub-object whose
  contents depend on the breadcrumb ``type``. See descriptions of
  breadcrumb types below.  Additional parameters that are unsupported
  by the type are rendered as a key/value table.
``category``
  Categories are dotted strings that indicate what the crumb is or
  where it comes from.  Typically it's a module name or a descriptive
  string.  For instance `ui.click` could be used to indicate that a
  click happend in the UI or `flask` could be used to indicate that
  the event originated in the Flask framework.
``level``
  This defines the level of the event.  If not provided it defaults to
  ``info`` which is the middle level.  In the order of priority from
  highest to lowest the levels are ``critical``, ``error``,
  ``warning``, ``info`` and ``debug``.  Levels are used in the UI to
  emphasize and deemphasize the crumb.

Breadcrumb Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below are descriptions of individual breadcrumb types, and what their ``data`` properties look like.

.. describe:: default

Describes an unspecified breadcrumb. This is typically a generic log message
or something similar.  The ``data`` part is entirely undefined and as
such completely rendered as a key/value table.

.. sourcecode:: json

    {
      "timestamp": 1461185753845,
      "message": "Something happened",
      "category": "log",
      "data": {
        "key": "value"
      }
    }

.. describe:: navigation

Describes a navigation breadcrumb. A navigation event can be a URL
change in a web application, or a UI transition in a mobile or desktop
application, etc.

Its ``data`` property has the following sub-properties:

``from``
  A string representing the original application state / location.
``to``
  A string representing the new application state / location.

.. sourcecode:: json

    {
      "timestamp": 1461185753845,
      "type": "navigation",
      "data": {
        "from": "/login",
        "to": "/dashboard"
      }
    }

.. describe:: http

Describes an HTTP request breadcrumb. This represents an HTTP request
transmitted from your application. This could be an AJAX request from
a web application, or a server-to-server HTTP request to an API
service provider, etc.

Its ``data`` property has the following sub-properties:

``url``
  The request URL.
``method``
  The HTTP request method.
``status_code``
  The HTTP status code of the response.
``reason``
  A text that describes the status code.

.. sourcecode:: json

    {
      "timestamp": 1461185753845,
      "type": "http",
      "data": {
        "url": "http://example.com/api/1.0/users",
        "method": "GET",
        "status_code": 200,
        "reason": "OK"
      }
    }
