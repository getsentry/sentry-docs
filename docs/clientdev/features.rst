Expected Features
=================

The following is a description of features that are commonly expected
in Sentry SDKs.

Uncaught exception handler
--------------------------

Ability for the SDK to be set as a hook to record any uncaught exceptions.
At the language level this is typically a global hook provided by the language
itself. For framework intergations this is typically part of middleware or some
other system.

Setting Attributes
------------------

Ability to set attributes on events sent to Sentry. They should be configurable
"globally" on the client itself (so that they are sent with all future events)
and also per event. Important examples are being able to set the ``release``,
``environment``, ``tags`` and ``extra``. :ref:`See the attributes page <attributes>`
for more information and examples.

Automatic Attributes
--------------------

Automatic addition of useful attributes such as ``tags`` or ``extra``.
Typically means the SDK hooks into a framework so that it can set attributes
that are known to be useful for most users.

Context system
--------------

A system for storing data that has to do with a given context. What context means
depends on the application, for a web framework it is most likely a single request/response
cycle. For a mobile application there is often just one single context that represents
the single user and their actions. Context can be difficult to implement because it often
has to deal with threads or concurrency and can involve deep integration with frameworks.
:ref:`See the context page <context>` for more information.

Breadcrumbs
-----------

Manually record application events (into the current context) during the lifecycle of an
application. Needs to implement a ring buffer so as not to grow indefinitely. The most recent
breadcrumbs should be attached to events as they are created.

With deeper framework integration, the automatic recording of some breadcrumbs is possible and
recommended.

Event Sampling
--------------

SDKs should allow the user to configure what percentage of events are actually
sent to the server (the rest should be silently ignored). For example:

.. sourcecode:: python

    sample_rate = options.get('sample_rate', 1.0)

    # assuming random() returns a value between 0.0 (inclusive) and 1.0 (exclusive)
    if random() < sample_rate:
        client.send(data)

HTTP 429 Retry-After backoff
----------------------------

Respect Sentry’s HTTP 429 Retry-After header when the user goes over their limits. Events
should be dropped during backoff.

Ignore patterns
---------------

The user should be able to define exceptions that are ignored/dropped based on the
error message or type.

In-App frames
-------------

Stack parsing can tell which frames should be identified as part of the user’s application
(as opposed to part of the language, a library, or a framework), either automatically or by
user configuration at startup, often declared as a package/module prefix.

Surrounding source in stacktrace
--------------------------------

Lines of source code to provide context in stacktraces. This is easier in interpreted languages,
may be hard or impossible in compiled ones.

Variable values
---------------

Local variable names and values for each stack frame, where possible. Restrictions apply on some
platforms, for example it's may only be possible to collect the values of parameters passed into
each function, or it may be completely impossible to collect this information at all.

Desymbolication
---------------

Turn compiled or obfuscated code/method names in stacktraces back into the original. Desymbolication
always requires Sentry backend support. Not necessary for many languages.

Configuration via the runtime environment
-----------------------------------------

Whether static client configuration can set/overridden by the runtime environment *without changing code*.
For example, a `SENTRY_RELEASE=1.3` environment variable that configures the client. Important so that
users can package/compile their applications once and adjust Sentry config without rebuilding (very common
now for all languages because of the popularity of containers). Not available or doesn't make sense on some
runtimes (browsers, mobile).

Retrieve last event ID
----------------------

Ability to get the ID of the last event sent. Event IDs are useful for correlation, logging, customers 
rolling their own feedback forms, etc.

User feedback
-------------

On user-facing platforms such as mobile or the browser this means first class support for requesting
user feedback when an error occurs.

On backend platforms, SDKs should document how to use the last event ID to prompt the user for feedback
themselves.

Pre-send hook
-------------

Hook called with the event **and** thrown exception (where applicable) that allow the user to decide 
whether an event should be sent or not.

Post-send hook
--------------

Hook called on success **or** error, and passed the event and exception
so that users can peform actions based on events actually being sent.

List loaded libraries
---------------------

Include a list of loaded libraries (and versions) when sending an event.

Buffer to disk
--------------

Write events to disk before attempting to send, so that they can be retried in the event of
a temporary network failure. Needs to implement a cap on the number of stored events.

This is mostly useful on mobile clients where connectivity is often not available.

HTTP Proxy
----------

Ability to use an HTTP proxy. Often easy to implement using the existing HTTP client.
