Sentry imposes limits on various fields within an event, as well as the size of full events and the requests they are sent in:

- Events, attachments, and requests exceeding payload size limits are immediately dropped with a `413 Payload Too Large` error. Sentry allows compressed content encoding, and applies separate limits before and after decompression.
- Fields exceeding the individual size limits are afterwards trimmed and truncated at a best effort.

<Alert>

If the event exceeds 200KB compressed or 1MB decompressed for events and 20MB compressed or 100MB decompressed for minidump uploads (all files combined), the event will be rejected. The number of events rejected due to size limits is counted towards the _Dropped_ category in [usage stats](/product/stats/#usage-stats).

</Alert>

To avoid using up your attachments quota — which is based on size and not number of instances of attachments data sent — or having the event dropped entirely, consider limiting the size of values passed into Sentry's APIs. For example, if your application attaches application state or request bodies to Sentry events, truncate them first.

The precise limits may change over time. For more information, please refer to the following resources:
