Each of these key features have their own page (or set of pages) in the [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) application.

- **Alerts** - Where you can create new alert rules and manage existing ones. Learn more in the full [Alerts documentation](/product/alerts/).

- **Dashboards** - Provide you with a broad overview of your applicationâ€™s health by allowing you to navigate through error and performance data across multiple projects. Dashboards are made up of one or more widgets, and each widget visualizes one or more **Discover** or **Issues** queries. Learn more in the full [Dashboards documentation](/product/dashboards/).
