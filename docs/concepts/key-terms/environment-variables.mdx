  Learn about environment variables that Sentry SDKs support for configuration
  without code changes.

Sentry SDKs support a set of common environment variables that allow you to configure SDK behavior without modifying your code. This is particularly useful for containerized deployments, serverless environments, or when you need to adjust settings without redeploying your application.

## Supported Environment Variables

The following environment variables are supported across Sentry server-side SDKs:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `SENTRY_DSN` | The [Data Source Name](/concepts/key-terms/dsn-explainer/) that tells the SDK where to send events. | `https://key@sentry.io/123` |
| `SENTRY_RELEASE` | The release version of your application. Used to associate events with source maps and track regressions. | `myapp@1.0.0` |
| `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` | The [environment](/concepts/key-terms/environments/) name, such as `production`, `staging`, or `development`. | `production` |
| `SENTRY_SAMPLE_RATE` | Controls the percentage of error events sent to Sentry (0.0 to 1.0). | `1.0` |
| `SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE` | Controls the percentage of transactions sent for [tracing](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/) (0.0 to 1.0). | `0.2` |
| `SENTRY_PROFILES_SAMPLE_RATE` | Controls the percentage of transactions that include profiling data (0.0 to 1.0). Requires tracing to be enabled. | `0.1` |
| `SENTRY_DEBUG` | Enables debug mode for troubleshooting SDK issues. | `true` |

<Alert>
Some SDKs may also offer additional SDK-specific environment variables beyond this common set. Check your [platform-specific documentation](/platforms/) for the full list of supported options.

## When to Use Environment Variables

Environment variables are ideal when you need to:

- **Change configuration without redeploying**: Update sample rates, switch environments, or rotate DSNs by modifying environment variables.
- **Keep secrets out of code**: Store the DSN as an environment variable instead of hardcoding it.
- **Use different settings per environment**: Set different sample rates or environments for staging versus production without code changes.

## Precedence

When both environment variables and code-based configuration are present, **code-based configuration takes precedence**. If you explicitly pass a value to your SDK's init function, the environment variable is ignored.

To use environment variables, omit the option from your init call and the SDK will read from the environment automatically:

```javascript
// SDK will read from SENTRY_DSN automatically
Sentry.init({
  // dsn omitted, will use SENTRY_DSN
});
```

```python
import sentry_sdk

# SDK will read from SENTRY_DSN automatically
sentry_sdk.init(
    # dsn omitted, will use SENTRY_DSN
)
```

```go
import "github.com/getsentry/sentry-go"

// SDK will read from SENTRY_DSN automatically
sentry.Init(sentry.ClientOptions{
    // Dsn omitted, will use SENTRY_DSN
})
```

```php
\Sentry\init([
    // dsn omitted, will use SENTRY_DSN
]);
```

## Client-Side Considerations

Environment variables work differently in client-side environments like web browsers, where the concept of environment variables doesn't exist at runtime. For frontend SDKs, you'll need to inject these values at build time or configure them directly in code.

For server-side SDKs (Node.js, Python, Ruby, Java, .NET, Go, PHP, etc.), environment variables are read at runtime when the SDK initializes.
