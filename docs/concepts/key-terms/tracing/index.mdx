[Distributed tracing](/product/sentry-basics/tracing/distributed-tracing/) provides a connected view of related errors and transactions by capturing interactions among your software systems. With tracing, Sentry tracks your software performance and displays the impact of errors across multiple systems. Tracing issues back through services connects your front-end to your back-end.

The [Trace View](/product/sentry-basics/tracing/trace-view/) allows you to drill down into the details of a single trace and traverse every transaction in that trace. This accelerates your ability to debug slow services, identify related errors, and root out other bottlenecks.

The [Trace Explorer](/product/explore/traces/) allows you to explore traces by querying [span properties](/concepts/search/searchable-properties/spans/). This helps you find relevant distributed traces that will give you more information to debug and optimize your code.
