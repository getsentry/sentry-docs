Some of the bellow terms have corresponding features with the same name listed (in upper case) on the [Key Features](#key-features) page.

- **alerts** - Alerts let you know about problems with your code in real-time by sending you notifications when certain alert rule conditions are met. There are several types of alerts available with customizable thresholds and integrations.

- **attachments** - Stored additional files, such as config or log files that are related to an error event.

- **data** - Anything you send to Sentry. This includes, events (errors or transactions), attachments, and event metadata.

- **distributed trace** - When a trace includes work in multiple services it's called a [distributed trace](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/distributed-tracing/), because the trace is distributed across those services.

- **DSN** - Data Source Name. A DSN tells the Sentry SDK where to send events so the events are associated with the correct project. Sentry automatically assigns you a DSN when you create a project. Learn more in our full [DSN documentation](/product/sentry-basics/dsn-explainer/).

- **environment** - `environment` is a Sentry-supported tag that you can add to your SDK that's intended to refer to your code deployments' naming convention, such as _development_, _testing_, _staging_, or _production_. Environments help you better filter issues and transactions among other uses. Learn more in our full [Environments documentation](/product/sentry-basics/environments/).

- **error** - What counts as an error varies by platform, but in general, if there's something that looks like an exception, it can be captured as an error in Sentry. Sentry automatically captures errors, uncaught exceptions, and unhandled rejections, as well as other types of errors, depending on platform.

- **event** - An error or a transaction.

- **issues** - An issue is a grouping of similar errors or performance problems. Every event has a set of characteristics called its fingerprint, which is what Sentry uses to group them. For example, Sentry groups error events together when they are triggered by the same part of your code. This grouping of events into issues allows you to see how frequently a problem is happening and how many users it's affecting.

- **performance monitoring** - Performance monitoring is the act of tracking application performance and measuring metrics such as how many transactions are being sent and the average response time for all occurrences of a given transaction. To do this, Sentry captures [distributed traces](/product/sentry-basics/tracing/distributed-tracing/) consisting of transactions and [spans](/product/sentry-basics/tracing/distributed-tracing/#traces-transactions-and-spans) to measure individual services, as well as operations within those services.

- **project** - A project represents your service or application in Sentry. You can create a project for a particular language or framework used in your application. For example, you might have separate projects for your API server and frontend client. For more information, check out our [best practices for creating projects](/organization/getting-started/#4-create-projects). Projects allow you to associate events with a distinct application in your organization and assign responsibility and ownership to specific users and teams within your organization.

- **release** - A release is a version of your code deployed to an environment. When you notify Sentry about a release, you can identify new issues and regressions associated with it, confirm whether an issue is resolved in the next release, and apply source maps. Learn more in the full [Releases documentation](/product/releases/).

- **release health** - Release health data provides insight into the impact of crashes and bugs as it relates to your user's experience and reveals trends with each new issue. Learn more in the full [release health documentation](/product/releases/health/).

- **sentry.io** - Sentry's user interface for SaaS customers, where event data captured by our SDK is visualized. (For self-hosted users, the user interface is on an internal domain for your company.)

- **Sentry SDKs** - Sentry's programming language/framework-specific libraries for application monitoring. When you add one of our SDKs to your application, event data from your application is captured and sent to Sentry, so we can provide you with error and performance reports.

- **span** - A [span](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/distributed-tracing/#traces-transactions-and-spans) is the basic unit that traces are composed of. Multiple groups of parent-child spans make up a trace in Sentry and share a trace_id, which can help you get to the root cause of a problem faster.

- **team** - Teams are associated with your Sentry projects, and their members receive issue notifications as a group. Learn more about [setting up teams](/organization/getting-started/#2-set-up-teams).

- **trace** - A [trace](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/) is the record of the entire operation you want to measure or track - like page load, an instance of a user completing some action in your application, or a cron job in your backend.

- **transaction** - A transaction represents a single instance of a service being called to support an operation you want to measure or track, like a page load, page navigation, or asynchronous task. Transaction events are grouped by the transaction name.
