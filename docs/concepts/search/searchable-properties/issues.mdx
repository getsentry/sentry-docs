[Issues](/product/issues/) are an aggregate of one or more error events. Searchable issues properties include status, assignment, aggregate counts, and age. You can search by issue properties in the **Issues** page and in **Dashboards** in the widget builder, depending on your dataset selection.

## Searchable Properties

Below is a list of keys and tokens that can be used in the issues search.

<Note>
You'll only need to use query syntax for **datetime** and **relative time** searchable property types if you're using the Sentry [API](/api/).
</Note>

<DefinitionList>

### `age`

Returns issues created since the time defined by the value. The syntax is similar to the Unix find command. Supported suffixes: `m - minutes`, `h - hours`, `d - days`, `w - weeks`. For example, `age:-24h` returns isssues that are new in the last 24 hours, while `age:+12h` returns ones that are older than 12 hours. Entering `age:+12h age:-24h` would return issues created between 12 and 24 hours ago.

### `assigned_or_suggested`

Returns issues that are assigned to or suggested to be assigned to the defined user(s) or team(s).
