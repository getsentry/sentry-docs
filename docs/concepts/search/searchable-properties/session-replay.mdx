[Session Replay](/product/explore/session-replay/) provides a video-like reproduction of user interactions on a site or web app. All user interactions, including page visits, mouse movements, clicks, and scrolls, are captured, helping developers connect the dots between a known issue and how a user experienced it in the UI.

You can search by session replay properties on the **Replay** page.

## Searchable Properties

Below is a list of keys and tokens that can be used in the session replay search.

<DefinitionList>

The version string of the browser.
