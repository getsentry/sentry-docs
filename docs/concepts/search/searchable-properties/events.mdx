Events are the underlying event data captured using Sentry SDKs — that is, errors and transactions.

You can search by event properties in the following [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) pages:

- Discover - in the query builder (depending on the dataset selection)
- Dashboards - within the widget builder (depending on dataset selection)
- Performance - only in transaction summaries
- Issues - as indicated in the list below
- Alerts - when creating a metric alert

<Note>

Please note that in Alerts only a limited number of properties are available for [filtering transaction events](/product/alerts/create-alerts/metric-alert-config/#tags--properties).

</Note>

When searching on event properties within the **Issues** page, the search will return any issue that has _one or more events_ matching the supplied event properties filter.
