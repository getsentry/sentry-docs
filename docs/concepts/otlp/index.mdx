Sentry can ingest OTel traces and logs directly via the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP). Sentry does not support ingesting OTLP metrics.

Sentry supports OTel in several ways, depending on your setup:

| Scenario | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| **Sentry frontend + OTel backend** | Use [propagateTraceparent](/concepts/otlp/sentry-with-otel/#linking-sentry-and-otlp-traces) to link frontend traces with OTLP instrumented backend services |
| **Sentry SDK + OTel in the same service** | Use the [OTLP Integration](/concepts/otlp/sentry-with-otel/#otlp-integration) to share trace context between Sentry and OTel |
| **OTel backend, no Sentry SDK** | Send [OTLP traces](/concepts/otlp/otlp-traces/) and [logs](/concepts/otlp/otlp-logs/) directly to Sentry via environment variables or collector config |

## OpenTelemetry Collector

The [OpenTelemetry Collector](/concepts/otlp/collector/) is a vendor-agnostic proxy that can receive, process, and export telemetry data. You can configure the Collector to forward logs and traces to Sentry.
