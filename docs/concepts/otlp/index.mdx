Sentry can ingest OpenTelemetry traces and logs via OTLP endpoints, either directly from an [OTel SDK](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/) or through a pipeline tool like the [OpenTelemetry Collector](/concepts/otlp/forwarding/pipelines/collector/). Sentry does not support OTLP metrics at this time.

## Linking Traces with Sentry SDK

If you're using a Sentry SDK alongside OTel instrumentation, you can connect them to share trace context:

| Scenario | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| **Sentry frontend + OTel backend** | Use [propagateTraceparent](/concepts/otlp/sentry-with-otel/#linking-sentry-and-otlp-traces) to connect frontend traces with OTel-instrumented backend services |
| **Sentry SDK + OTel in the same service** | Use the [OTLP Integration](/concepts/otlp/sentry-with-otel/#otlp-integration) to share trace context between Sentry and OTel |

## Sending OTel Data to Sentry

If you're using OTel without a Sentry SDK, or want to ingest telemetry from infrastructure sources:

- **[Direct Export](/concepts/otlp/direct/)** - Configure your OTel SDK to send traces and logs directly to Sentry's OTLP endpoints
- **[Sentry Exporter](/concepts/otlp/sentry-exporter/)** - Route telemetry from multiple services to different Sentry projects through a single collector instance
- **[Forwarding](/concepts/otlp/forwarding/)** - Use the OpenTelemetry Collector, Vector, or Fluent Bit to forward data from infrastructure sources (CloudWatch, Kafka, Nginx, syslog, etc.)
- **[Log and Trace Drains](/product/drains/)** - Send telemetry from managed hosting platforms (Vercel, Cloudflare, Heroku, etc.)
