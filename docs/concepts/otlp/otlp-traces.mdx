If you're using OTel without a Sentry SDK, you can send traces directly to Sentry's OTLP endpoint. You can find your endpoint URL and auth key in [Project settings > Client Keys (DSN)](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/settings/projects/).

## Known Limitations

- Span events are not supported. All span events are dropped during ingestion.
- Span links are partially supported. We ingest and display span links, but they cannot be searched, filtered, or aggregated. Links are shown in the [Trace View](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/trace-view/).
- Array attributes are partially supported. We ingest and display array attributes, but they cannot be searched, filtered, or aggregated. Array attributes are shown in the [Trace View](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/trace-view/).

## Configuration

```bash {filename: .env}
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT="___OTLP_TRACES_URL___"
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_HEADERS="x-sentry-auth=sentry sentry_key=___PUBLIC_KEY___"
```

## Using the OTel Collector

You can configure your OTel collector instance to send traces to Sentry directly. This requires you to add an `otlphttp` exporter to your collector instance. Sentry's OTLP endpoints are project-specific, so you might also need to add a [routing connector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/connector/routingconnector) to route traces to the correct project.

```yaml {filename: otel-collector.yaml}
exporters:
  otlphttp:
    traces_endpoint: ___OTLP_TRACES_URL___
    headers:
      x-sentry-auth: "sentry sentry_key=___PUBLIC_KEY___"
    compression: gzip
    encoding: proto
    timeout: 30s
```

## Using an OTel SDK

You can configure the OTel Exporter directly in your application code. Here is an example with the OTel Node SDK:

```typescript {filename: app.ts}
import { NodeSDK } from "@opentelemetry/sdk-node";
import { OTLPTraceExporter } from "@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http";

const sdk = new NodeSDK({
  traceExporter: new OTLPTraceExporter({
    url: "___OTLP_TRACES_URL___",
    headers: {
      "x-sentry-auth": "sentry sentry_key=___PUBLIC_KEY___",
    },
  }),
});

sdk.start();
```
