description: Pipelines for forwarding telemetry data to Sentry.
---

Pipelines collect telemetry from infrastructure sources (like log files, message queues, or cloud services) and forward it to Sentry via OTLP. Use a pipeline to forward infrastructure telemetry to Sentry. This works alongside or instead of SDK instrumentation in your applications.

| Pipeline | Best For |
|----------|----------|
| [OpenTelemetry Collector](/concepts/otlp/forwarding/pipelines/collector/) | Supports logs and traces from many sources |
| [Vector](/concepts/otlp/forwarding/pipelines/vector/) | Log routing with powerful filtering and low resource usage |
| [Fluent Bit](/concepts/otlp/forwarding/pipelines/fluentbit/) | Logs and traces with minimal resource footprint |

**Not sure which to use?** Start with the [OpenTelemetry Collector](/concepts/otlp/forwarding/pipelines/collector/). It supports many data sources (see our [source guides](/concepts/otlp/forwarding/sources/) for common examples).
