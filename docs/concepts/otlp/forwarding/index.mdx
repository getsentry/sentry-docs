description: Forward logs and traces to Sentry from various sources using the OpenTelemetry Collector, Vector, or Fluent Bit.
---

Forward logs and traces to Sentry from infrastructure sources without modifying application code. This is useful for capturing telemetry from cloud services, message queues, web servers, and system logs.

## Pipelines

Choose a [pipeline](/concepts/otlp/forwarding/tools/) based on your needs:

| Pipeline | Best For | Logs | Traces |
|----------|----------|:----:|:------:|
| [OpenTelemetry Collector](/concepts/otlp/forwarding/tools/collector/) | Full pipeline with many receivers and processors | ✅ | ✅ |
| [Vector](/concepts/otlp/forwarding/tools/vector/) | Lightweight log routing with transformations | ✅ | ❌ |
| [Fluent Bit](/concepts/otlp/forwarding/tools/fluentbit/) | Minimal resource usage | ✅ | ✅ |

## Source Guides
