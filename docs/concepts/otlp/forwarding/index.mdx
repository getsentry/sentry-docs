description: Forward logs and traces to Sentry from various sources using the OpenTelemetry Collector, Vector, or Fluent Bit.

Forward logs and traces to Sentry from infrastructure sources using a pipeline tool like the [OpenTelemetry Collector](/concepts/otlp/forwarding/pipelines/collector/), [Vector](/concepts/otlp/forwarding/pipelines/vector/), or [Fluent Bit](/concepts/otlp/forwarding/pipelines/fluentbit/). For multi-project routing with automatic project creation in Sentry, use the [Sentry Exporter](/concepts/otlp/forwarding/pipelines/sentry-exporter/). This approach doesn't require modifying application code.

Use forwarding when:
- You need to collect logs from infrastructure (cloud services, web servers, message queues)
- You want to process or transform telemetry before sending to Sentry
- You're aggregating data from multiple sources
- You need to route data to multiple destinations

If you just want to send traces or logs from your application code without an intermediary, see [Direct Export](/concepts/otlp/direct/) instead.

<Alert>

**How is this different from Log and Trace Drains?** [Log and Trace Drains](/product/drains/) are for managed hosting platforms (Vercel, Cloudflare, Heroku) where the platform provides and runs the telemetry pipeline for you. OTLP Forwarding is for when you run and manage the pipeline yourself (like the OpenTelemetry Collector).
