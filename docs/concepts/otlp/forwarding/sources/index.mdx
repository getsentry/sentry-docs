description: Guides for forwarding data from specific sources to Sentry using the OpenTelemetry Collector.
---

These guides show you how to forward data from specific infrastructure sources to Sentry using the [OpenTelemetry Collector](/concepts/otlp/forwarding/tools/collector/).

| Source | Logs | Traces |
|--------|:----:|:------:|
| [AWS CloudWatch](/concepts/otlp/forwarding/sources/aws-cloudwatch/) | ✅ | ❌ |
| [Kafka](/concepts/otlp/forwarding/sources/kafka/) | ✅ | ✅ |
| [Nginx](/concepts/otlp/forwarding/sources/nginx/) | ✅ | ❌ |
| [Syslog](/concepts/otlp/forwarding/sources/syslog/) | ✅ | ❌ |
| [Windows Events](/concepts/otlp/forwarding/sources/windows-events/) | ✅ | ❌ |

Each guide assumes you have the OpenTelemetry Collector installed. See the [Collector setup guide](/concepts/otlp/forwarding/tools/collector/) first if you haven't configured it yet.
