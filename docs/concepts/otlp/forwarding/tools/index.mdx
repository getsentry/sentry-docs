description: Pipelines for forwarding telemetry data to Sentry.
---

Choose a pipeline to forward telemetry data to Sentry:

| Pipeline | Best For | Logs | Traces |
|----------|----------|:----:|:------:|
| [OpenTelemetry Collector](/concepts/otlp/forwarding/tools/collector/) | Full telemetry pipeline with receivers, processors, and exporters | ✅ | ✅ |
| [Vector](/concepts/otlp/forwarding/tools/vector/) | Lightweight log routing with VRL transformations | ✅ | ❌ |
| [Fluent Bit](/concepts/otlp/forwarding/tools/fluentbit/) | Lightweight forwarding with minimal resource usage | ✅ | ✅ |

**OpenTelemetry Collector** is the most versatile option. It supports many receivers for different data sources and can process/transform data before exporting. Use it when you need to collect from infrastructure sources like AWS CloudWatch, Kafka, or syslog.

**Vector** and **Fluent Bit** are lighter-weight alternatives focused on log forwarding. They're easier to set up for simple use cases.
