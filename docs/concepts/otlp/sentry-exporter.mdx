<Alert level="info">
  The Sentry Exporter has **alpha** stability for traces and logs.
</Alert>

The Sentry Exporter routes telemetry from multiple services to different Sentry projects through a single collector instance. Without it, you'd need to configure separate DSNs for each project or set up additional routing connectors.

## When to Use `sentry` vs `otlphttp` Exporters

| Scenario | Recommended Exporter |
|----------|---------------------|
| Single project, all services share one DSN | `otlphttp` |
| Multiple projects, need per-service routing | `sentry` |
| Dynamic environments with auto-provisioning | `sentry` with `auto_create_projects` |

## Prerequisites

### Collector Distribution

The Sentry Exporter is included in [otelcol-contrib](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-releases/tree/main/distributions/otelcol-contrib). For the full specification, see the [source code](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/sentryexporter).

### Auth Token

In your Sentry account, create an Internal Integration with the required permissions:

1. Go to **Settings > Developer Settings > Internal Integrations**
2. Click **Create New Integration**
3. Set permissions:
   - **Project: Read** - required for endpoint resolution
   - **Project: Write** - only if using `auto_create_projects`
4. Copy the token and store it securely:

```bash
export SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN="sntrys_eyJ..."
```

### Organization Slug

In your Sentry account, go to **Settings > General Settings** to find your organization slug. Alternatively, you can find it in  your Sentry URL: `https://sentry.io/organizations/{org-slug}/`

## Configuration Reference

### Required

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `url` | string | Base URL of your Sentry instance |
| `org_slug` | string | Your Sentry organization slug |
| `auth_token` | string | Internal Integration token |

### Optional

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `auto_create_projects` | bool | `false` | Create missing projects automatically |
| `routing.project_from_attribute` | string | `service.name` | Resource attribute for routing |
| `routing.attribute_to_project_mapping` | map | - | Map attribute values to project slugs |
| `timeout` | duration | `30s` | Exporter timeout |
| `http` | object | collector defaults | Standard [confighttp](https://pkg.go.dev/go.opentelemetry.io/collector/config/confighttp) client settings (timeout, TLS, headers) |
| `sending_queue` | object | enabled | Queue settings from exporterhelper |

## Basic Configuration

By default, the exporter routes telemetry based on `service.name`. A service with `service.name: payments-api` sends to a Sentry project with slug `payments-api`.

```yaml {filename:otel-collector-config.yaml}
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318

exporters:
  sentry:
    url: https://sentry.io
    org_slug: ${env:SENTRY_ORG_SLUG}
    auth_token: ${env:SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN}

processors:
  batch:

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [sentry]
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [sentry]
```

## Routing Options

### Automatic Project Creation

When services spin up dynamically (Kubernetes deployments, serverless functions), you may not have pre-created Sentry projects. Enable `auto_create_projects` to provision them on-demand:

```yaml
exporters:
  sentry:
    # ... required fields
    auto_create_projects: true
```

<Alert level="warning">
  Project creation is asynchronous. The first batch of data for a new project may be dropped while provisioning completes.
</Alert>

### Custom Project Mapping

When your service names don't match your Sentry project slugs (legacy naming, organizational conventions), map them explicitly:

```yaml
exporters:
  sentry:
    # ... required fields
    routing:
      attribute_to_project_mapping:
        orders-service: ecommerce-orders
        products-service: ecommerce-products
        api-gateway: ecommerce-gateway
```

Services not in the mapping fall back to using `service.name` as the project slug.

### Routing by Different Attributes

Route by environment, team, or any other resource attribute instead of service name:

```yaml
exporters:
  sentry:
    # ... required fields
    routing:
      project_from_attribute: deployment.environment
      attribute_to_project_mapping:
        production: prod-monitoring
        staging: staging-monitoring
```

## Self-Hosted Sentry

For self-hosted installations, configure the base URL and any required TLS settings:

```yaml
exporters:
  sentry:
    url: https://sentry.example.com
    org_slug: ${env:SENTRY_ORG_SLUG}
    auth_token: ${env:SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN}
    timeout: 20s
    http:
      tls:
        insecure_skip_verify: true  # Only for development
```

## Rate Limiting

The exporter respects Sentry's rate limits automatically:

- Parses `X-Sentry-Rate-Limits` headers
- Tracks per-project, per-category (traces/logs) rate limit deadlines
- Returns throttle errors to the collector queue for retry
- Falls back to 60-second backoff on HTTP 429 without headers

## Limitations

| Limitation | Mitigation |
|------------|------------|
| Missing routing attribute drops data | Ensure `service.name` is set on all resources |
| First batch for auto-created projects may drop | Subsequent data flows normally after provisioning |
| Deleted projects cause 403 until cache evicts | Avoid deleting projects while collector is running |
| Single organization per exporter | Deploy multiple exporters for multi-org setups |

## Additional Tools

<Expandable title="Interactive Setup with Claude Code" level="success">

If you use [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com), a setup skill can guide you through configuration step-by-step.

**Installation:**

{/* TODO: add installation instructions */}

**Usage:**

Once installed, invoke the skill with:
```
/sentry-otel-exporter
```

Or ask Claude Code:
```
"Help me set up the Sentry OpenTelemetry Exporter"
```

The skill guides you through:
- Creating a Sentry auth token
- Choosing the right routing strategy
- Generating collector configuration
- Testing and verifying the setup
