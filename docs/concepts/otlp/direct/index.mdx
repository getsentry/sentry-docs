description: Send OpenTelemetry traces and logs directly to Sentry from your OTel SDK.
---

Configure your OpenTelemetry SDK to send traces and logs directly to Sentry's OTLP endpoints without an intermediary.

Use direct export when:
- You want the simplest setup
- You don't need to process or transform telemetry before sending
- You're not aggregating data from multiple sources

If you need to collect data from infrastructure, transform data, or route to multiple destinations, see [Forwarding](/concepts/otlp/forwarding/) instead.
