<Include name="feature-available-open-beta-tracing.mdx" />

Send traces directly from your OpenTelemetry SDK to Sentry's OTLP endpoint. You can find your endpoint URL and auth key in [Project settings > Client Keys (DSN)](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/settings/projects/).

## Environment Variables

The simplest way to configure your OTel SDK:

```bash {filename: .env}
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT="___OTLP_TRACES_URL___"
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_HEADERS="x-sentry-auth=sentry sentry_key=___PUBLIC_KEY___"
```

## SDK Configuration

You can also configure the exporter directly in your application code. Here's an example with the OTel Node SDK:

```typescript {filename: app.ts}
import { NodeSDK } from "@opentelemetry/sdk-node";
import { OTLPTraceExporter } from "@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http";

const sdk = new NodeSDK({
  traceExporter: new OTLPTraceExporter({
    url: "___OTLP_TRACES_URL___",
    headers: {
      "x-sentry-auth": "sentry sentry_key=___PUBLIC_KEY___",
    },
  }),
});

sdk.start();
```

## Known Limitations

- Span events are not supported. All span events are dropped during ingestion.
- Span links are partially supported. We ingest and display span links, but they cannot be searched, filtered, or aggregated. Links are shown in the [Trace View](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/trace-view/).
- Array attributes are partially supported. We ingest and display array attributes, but they cannot be searched, filtered, or aggregated. Array attributes are shown in the [Trace View](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/trace-view/).

## Using a Collector Instead

If you need to process traces before sending them to Sentry (sampling, transforming, routing to multiple projects), see the [OpenTelemetry Collector](/concepts/otlp/forwarding/pipelines/collector/) guide.
