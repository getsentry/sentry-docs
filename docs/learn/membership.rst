Membership
==========

Membership in Sentry is handled at the organizational level. The system is designed so each user has a singular account which can be reused across multiple organizations (even those using SSO). Each user of Sentry should have their own account, and will then be able to set their own personal preferences in addition to receiving notifications for events.
