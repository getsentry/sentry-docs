Quotas & Filtering
==================

A subscription to Sentry primarily entails a resource quota on the amount
of events you can send within a window of time. These windows generally
apply to a 60-second bucket, and your subsription will provide a rate limit
which is the maximum number of events the server will accept during that
period. When this threshold has been reached the server will respond with
a 429 HTTP status code.

Additionally some plans may also include a daily rate limit. For example, if
you're on the Limited plan, you'll be restricted to a maximum of 250 events
per day.

Increasing Quotas
-----------------

Each tiered plan in Sentry has a predefined rate limit. Generally the more
expensive the plan, the more data you're allowed to send. While the plans
available will generally fit most individual and small business needs, there
often arises a need for more. Fear not, Sentry is designed to handle large
throughput, and if your team needs more we're happy to help. Reach out to
your account manager, or send an email to support@getsentry.com to learn
more about increasing capacity.

Rate Limiting Projects
----------------------

You can set an organization-wide per-project rate limit via the "Rate Limits"
link on your dashboard. For example, you might want to set this to "90%", which
means no individual project can send more than 90% of your organization's quota.

Inbound Data Filters
--------------------

In some cases the data you're receiving in Sentry is hard to filter, or you simply
don't have the ability to update the client's application to apply the filters. Due
to this Sentry provides several ways to filter data server-side, which will also
apply before any rate limits are checked.

Built-in Filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Various built-in filters are available within Sentry. You can find these by going to
**[Project] » Inbound Data Filters**. Each filter caters to specific situations, such
as web crawlers or old browsers, and can be enabled as needed by the specific application.

IP Blocklist
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have a rogue client you may find yourself simple wanting to block that IP from
sending data. Sentry supports this by going to **[Project] » General** and adding the
IP addresses (or subnets) under the **Client Security** section.

Attributes Limits
-----------------

Sentry imposes hard limits on various components within an event. While
the limits may change over time, and vary between attributes most
individual attributes are capped at 512 bytes. Additionally, certain
attributes also limit the maximum number of items.

For example, ``extra`` data is limited to 100 items, and each item is
capped at 512 bytes. Similar restrictions apply to context locals (within
a stacktrace's frame), as well as any similar attributes.

Generic attributes like the event's label also have limits, but are more
flexible depending on their case. For example, the message attribute is
limited to 1024 bytes.

The following limitations will be automatically enforced:

*   Events greater than 100k are immediately dropped.
*   Stacktraces with large frame counts will be trimmed (the middle
    frames are dropped).
*   Collections exceeding the max items will be trimmed down to the
    maximum size.
*   Individually values exceeding the maximum length will be trimmed down
    to the maximum size.
