Sentry supports data storage in both the US and the EU.

You can choose where to store your data when you’re setting up your Sentry account by selecting from the dropdown menu under "Data Storage Location" in the "Create a New Organization" section.

**Please note that once selected, your data storage location can’t be changed. The only way to switch it is by creating a new organization.**

Your selection determines your data storage location only. Sentry will continue to access and process your data in accordance with your agreement with Sentry for the Sentry service and our [Privacy Policy](https://sentry.io/privacy/).

The table below shows the location where your data will be stored at rest, based on your selection.

| **Data Storage Location**     | **Physical Location** |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------- |
| United States of America (US) | Iowa, USA             |
| European Union (EU)           | Frankfurt, Germany    |

## What Types of Data Are Stored Where

Here’s a list of the types of data that will be stored in whichever data storage location (US or EU) you select.

### Data Stored In Selected Location (US or EU)

- Error events
- Transactions
- Profiles
- Release health
- Releases, debug symbols, and source maps
- Session replays
- Backups for these resources

### Data Stored in US

Here’s a list of the types of data that may be stored in the US.

- User accounts, notification settings, and 2FA authenticators
  (User accounts are shared by many organizations.)
- Organization integration metadata
  (Integrations can be shared across organizations and many of our integrations only support sending their webhooks to a singular destination.)
- Access tokens for users and organizations
- Organization settings, configurations, and teams
- Organization audit logs
- Issue activity, issue links
- Cron check-ins
- Project metadata
- DSN keys
- Detailed usage data

- SSO, SAML, and SCIM metadata


Metadata that lets Sentry identify an organization will be replicated out of the organization's data storage location to facilitate login, and backwards-compatible APIs. You can always confirm the location of your organization by viewing your organization's settings page.

## Switching Data Storage Locations for Existing Organizations
