sidebar_order: 1
description: "The Cursor Background Agent integration allows you to launch Cursor background agents directly from Seer to help debug, fix issues, and create pull requests for you."
---

You can trigger Cursor Background Agents from your [Seer Issue Fix](/product/ai-in-sentry/seer/issue-fix/) tab. The background Agents will be provided with Seer's Root Cause Analysis alongside the issue context. Seer's Root Cause Analysis will provide much needed context for the background agent to understand the issue and generate a solution.
