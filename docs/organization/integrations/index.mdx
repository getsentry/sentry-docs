---

Sentry integrates with your favorite apps and services. Each integration offers features that help track and triage your errors. If you're experiencing issues with some integrations after making changes to your Sentry instance or organization, check out our [troubleshooting guide](/organization/integrations/troubleshooting/).

## Integration Platform

Sentryâ€™s integration platform provides a way for external services to interact with Sentry. Integrations utilizing this platform are first-class actors within Sentry, and you can build them for [public](/organization/integrations/integration-platform/public-integration) as well as [internal](/organization/integrations/integration-platform/internal-integration) use cases.

For more details, see the [full Integration Platform documentation](/organization/integrations/integration-platform/).

## Toggleable Features
Some integrations have features that can be enabled or disabled through a toggle at the integration level. Toggling features on/off takes effect instantly across the integration. Defaults are dependent on the feature, per integration.

Not every integration has toggleable features, but if they do, you can find them in the `Features` tab for the specific integration's settings.
