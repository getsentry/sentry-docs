---

Sentry integrates with your favorite apps and services. Each integration offers features that help track and triage your errors. If you're experiencing issues with some integrations after making changes to your Sentry instance or organization, check out our [troubleshooting guide](/organization/integrations/troubleshooting/).

## Integration Platform

Sentry’s integration platform provides a way for external services to interact with Sentry. Integrations utilizing this platform are first-class actors within Sentry, and you can build them for [public](/organization/integrations/integration-platform/public-integration) as well as [internal](/organization/integrations/integration-platform/internal-integration) use cases.

For more details, see the [full Integration Platform documentation](/organization/integrations/integration-platform/).
