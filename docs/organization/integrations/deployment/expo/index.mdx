## Sentry Integration With Expo dashboard

<Alert level="warning">

If you make changes to your organization slug, you'll need to update your configuration for this integration. Learn more in our [troubleshooting guide](/organization/integrations/troubleshooting).

</Alert>

The Sentry integration with Expo allows you to view crash reports and [Session Replays](/platforms/react-native/session-replay/) for your Expo app deployments directly within your Expo Application Services (EAS) dashboard. This integration provides a direct link to Sentry stack traces with full context, sessions replays, and debugging capabilities.

### Install

<Alert>

Sentry owner, manager, or admin permissions are required to install this integration.

</Alert>

1. Log in to your Expo dashboard and open **Account Settings > Overview** (`https://expo.dev/accounts/[your-account]/settings`).
2. Locate the **Connections** section and click **Connect** next to Sentry.
3. Login to Sentry and accept the integration into your organization. You will be redirected back to Account Settings > Overview.

### Configure

#### Link Your Projects

After connecting your accounts, you need to link your Expo dashboard Project to your Sentry Project:

1. Open **Projects > [Your Project] > Configuration > Project settings** in Expo dashboard.
2. Click **Link** and select your Sentry Project from the dropdown.

### Usage

To see your Sentry Issues and Replays in Expo dashboard, you'll first need to ensure you've created a [Expo dashboard channel](https://docs.expo.dev/eas-update/how-it-works/) and assigned builds to it to create an [EAS deployment](https://docs.expo.dev/eas-update/deployment/). Once this is done, you can view your Sentry data by: 

1. Open **Projects > [Your Project] > Updates > Deployments > [Deployment]** to view Sentry data from a Release.


<Alert level="info">
  To take advantage of this integration, you need to add the Sentry React Native SDK to your Expo application. You can easily set up the SDK by running the Sentry wizard:

  ```bash
  npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i reactNative
  ```

  For more details on using Sentry with Expo, refer to the [Sentry documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/react-native/) for React Native applications.
