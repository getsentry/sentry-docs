incident.io is a end-to-end incident management platform which allows you to page your on-call engineers and create chat-app based incidents off the back of Sentry alerts.

You can also load context from your Sentry account into incident.io's [Catalog](https://incident.io/catalog).

This integration is maintained and supported by the company that created it. For more details, check out our [Integration Platform documentation](/organization/integrations/integration-platform/).
