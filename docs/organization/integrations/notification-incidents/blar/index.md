Blar captures new errors and alerts from Sentry, triggering an agent that traverses and explores the user's code to generate a detailed report on what went wrong. This helps developers save time by allowing them to go straight into solving the issue.
This integration is maintained and supported by the company that created it. For more details, check out our [Integration Platform documentation](/organization/integrations/integration-platform/).
