The Cased integration is a comprehensive DevOps monitoring tool that interfaces seamlessly with Sentry. It is designed to read and query data from Sentry to provide detailed contextual information about application health and issues to our users. 
Key features include:
- Real-time data querying from Sentry for actionable insights into application performance and error tracking.
- Enhanced issue context to facilitate swift and effective incident response and debugging.
- Receipt of webhook alerts from Sentry to trigger our incident response workflow, including alerts aggregation, deduplication, and smart notification routing.
- Customizable dashboards that provide an overview of Sentry events, allowing for quick assessment and response prioritization.
- Integration with communication tools to streamline incident management and team coordination during outages or high-severity events.
