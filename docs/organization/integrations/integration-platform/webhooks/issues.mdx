### status
Some issue webhooks are triggered on status change of an issue. An issue status can be `resolved`, `unresolved`, or `ignored` (archived).

### substatus
A status can mean multiple things, so substatus gives more details about the status. For example, an issue status can change to `unresolved` because it is now `escalating` or because a resolved issue is `regressed`. Possible substatuses are: `archived_until_escalating`, `archived_until_condition_met`, `archived_forever`, `escalating`, `ongoing`, `regressed` and `new`.

* `inRelease`: The release that the resolution is in for example `latest`
* `inNextRelease`: `True` if the resolution will be in the next release
* `inCommit`: Includes information about the resolution commit, for example `repository` and `commit`
* `ignoreDuration`: Duration for an archived issue before it's turns to escalated in minutes
* `ignoreCount`: Maximum number of occurences in for an archived issue before it gets escalated
