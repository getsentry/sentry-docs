<Note>

We've built an [example application](https://github.com/getsentry/integration-platform-example) to help you get started with building on Sentry's integration platform! Check it out for useful code snippets for adding these features in Python and TypeScript. See the [docs](/product/integrations/integration-platform/#example-app) for more information.

</Note>

The Sentry integration platform provides developers with the ability to define components to render within specific parts of [sentry.io](https://sentry.io), through a JSON-based schema.

You can define the following components:

- [Issue Link](/product/integrations/integration-platform/ui-components/issue-link) (uses [FormField](/product/integrations/integration-platform/ui-components/formfield) components)
- [Alert Rule Actions](/product/integrations/integration-platform/ui-components/alert-rule-action) (uses [FormField](/product/integrations/integration-platform/ui-components/formfield) components)
- [Stack Trace Link](/product/integrations/integration-platform/ui-components/stacktrace-link)

## Schema

The UI components are specified in the schema section of the integration details. The required form of this schema is:

```json {filename: schema.json}
{
  "elements": [
    // Component schemas to be used by the integration
    // e.g. { "type": "alert-rule-action", ... }
  ]
}
```

### URI Guidelines

The `uri` keys in your schema elements describe the URI path that will receive a request from that UI component. Sentry will append the path in the `uri` field onto the host of your integration's _webhook URL_.
For example, if the webhook URL is `https://example.com/webhook/`, and your schema's `uri` attribute is `/alerts/`, then the integration will receive requests to `https://example.com/alerts/`.

## Error Handling

Component rendering either 100% works or shows nothing. To protect the integration from looking chaotic due to errors we have no control over, if any part of the third-party component rendering fails, nothing will render.

If there is an error in an issue linking component, the link will be disabled.
