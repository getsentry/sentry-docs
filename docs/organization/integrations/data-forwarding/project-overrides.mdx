Project Overrides allows you to have a different forwarding configuration to be different for a particular project. They can be configured for each provider by navigating to **Settings » Data Forwarding » [Provider] » Edit** and scrolling down to **Manage your overrides**.

Click on the project you wish to override and provide inputs for the particular fields you wish to override. Note that fields you do not fill in will use the main org-level config fields.

Click Save Override to apply the new field. Now the project should say it's "Forwarding with Overrides".
