description: "Learn about Sentry's Sevvy integration, which helps users debug, fix, and prevent issues, with full-stack context."
---
The Sevvy integration connects Sentry with Sevvy, an AI on-call engineer that monitors your production systems, debugs failures, and performs root-cause analysis using rich context from across your stack. When issues are created or updated in Sentry, the agent enriches the event 
with data from your logs, metrics, source code, databases, docs, runbooks, PRs, deployments, and past incidents, summarizing the root cause and remediation steps.

This integration is maintained and supported by Sevvy. or more details, questions, or support feel free to contact support@sevvyai.com.
