Tembo is a cloud coding agents platform that offers unified access to claude code, codex, ampcode, cursor cli, and more! It autonomously identifies database performance bottlenecks, prioritizes sentry issues, writes optimized code fixes, and submits ready-to-deploy PRs directly to your repos. This integration is maintained and supported by Tembo. For more details, questions, or support feel free to contact support@tembo.io.
