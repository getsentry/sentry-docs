This integration connects Sentry with Elba's access review platform to provide organizations with a comprehensive solution for managing and reviewing user access within Sentry. 
This helps users enhance security, ensure compliance, and improve operational efficiency by providing:

- Risk Reduction: Regular access reviews help identify and eliminate unnecessary or unauthorized access, reducing the risk of data breaches and insider threats.
- Proactive Management: Early detection of permission anomalies allows for prompt corrective actions.

It connects to Sentry's API to fetch detailed information about organization members, including their roles, team memberships, and permission levels. The retrieved data is presented within Elba's platform, where administrators can systematically review each user's access rights. And, The platform analyzes user permissions to identify potential security risks, such as excessive privileges or outdated access, and provides recommendations for remediation.


This integration is maintained and supported by Elba. For more details, or questions, feel free to contact support@elba.security.
