## Evaluation Tracking

Sentry can track flag evaluations as they happen within your application.  Flag evaluations will appear in the "Feature Flag" section of the Issue Details page as a table, with "suspect" flag predictions highlighted in yellow. Learn more about how to interact with feature flag insights within the Sentry UI by reading the [Issue Details page documentation](/product/issues/issue-details/#feature-flags).

### Set Up Evaluation Tracking

To set up evaluation tracking, visit one of our supported languages pages:
* [JavaScript](/platforms/javascript/configuration/integrations/launchdarkly/)
* [Python](/platforms/python/integrations/feature-flags/launchdarkly/)

## Change Tracking

Sentry can track changes to feature flag definitions and report suspicious feature flag edits.

### Set Up Change Tracking

Enabling Change Tracking is a three step process. To get started, visit the [feature flags settings page](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/settings/feature-flags) in a new tab. Then follow the steps listed below.

1. **Click the "Add New Provider" button.**
    - One webhook secret can be registered per provider type.
    - Select LaunchDarkly in the dropdown that says "Select a provider".
2. **Register the webhook URL**.
    - Copy the provided Sentry webhook URL and paste it into LaunchDarkly within their [webhook integration UI](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings/integrations/webhooks/new).
3. **Set the Signing Secret**.
    - In the LaunchDarkly webhook UI, check the box that says "Sign this webhook".
    - Copy the signing secret in the revealed input box and paste it into the input box next to "Secret" in Sentry settings.
    - Save the secret by clicking "Add Provider" in Sentry settings.
    - Save the webhook by clicking "Save settings" in LaunchDarkly.

Once saved, Sentry will now accept and authenticate all inbound hooks to your organization's feature flag webhook endpoint.
