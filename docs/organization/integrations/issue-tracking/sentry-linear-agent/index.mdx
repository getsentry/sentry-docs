---

The Sentry Agent for Linear allows users to delegate activity to Sentry, which will trigger a Seer Root Cause Analysis and Issue Fix to run on the issue in Linear. These results can then be used with other Linear agents to trigger additional actions.

This integration highly benefits from having [automation configured within Seer](/product/ai-in-sentry/seer/#automation), to automatically create Root Cause Analysis and Solutions based on fixability scores from Seer. 

<Alert title="Beta">

**Sentry Agent for Linear** is in its beta phase. Changes to the UX and functionality should be expected.
