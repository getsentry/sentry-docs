Turn Sentry issues into Teamwork tasks to streamline team collaboration and your development workflows.

Teamwork needs to set up only once per organization, then it is available for _all_ projects. It is maintained and supported by the company that created it. For more details, check out our [Integration Platform documentation](/product/integrations/integration-platform/).

## Install and Configure

<Note>

Sentry owner, manager, or admin permissions are required to install this integration.

Teamwork **won't** work with self-hosted Sentry.

</Note>

1. Navigate to **Settings > Integrations > Teamwork**
