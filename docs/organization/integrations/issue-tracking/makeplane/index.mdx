The Makeplane (Plane) integration enables automatic creation of Plane issues from Sentry alerts, supports linking Sentry issues to Plane issues, and keeps their status in sync for streamlined error tracking and resolution. This integration is maintained and supported by Plane; for more details reach out to support@plane.so.

## Install and Configure

<Alert>

Sentry owner, manager, or admin permissions are required to install this integration.

</Alert>


1. Navigate to **Settings > Integrations > Makeplane**

2. Follow the full [Plane setup instructions](https://docs.plane.so/integrations/sentry).


**Note:** The Makeplane integration for *Self-Hosted Sentry* requires manual installation via a custom integration of Plane on Sentry, plus the *Self-Hosted version of Plane*. 

In order to set up both integrations properly, you must:
1. Follow the full [Sentry installation instructions](https://developers.plane.so/self-hosting/govern/integrations/sentry) for Self-Hosted Plane.
2. Once you have completed the installation, you must then follow the [Plane Setup Instructions](https://docs.plane.so/integrations/sentry) to get both the Sentry and Plane integrations to talk to each other.
