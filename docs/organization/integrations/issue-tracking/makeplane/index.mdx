The Makeplane (Plane) integration enables automatic creation of Plane issues from Sentry alerts, supports linking Sentry issues to Plane issues, and keeps their status in sync for streamlined error tracking and resolution. This integration is maintained and supported by Plane; for more details reach out to support@plane.so.

## Install and Configure

<Alert>

Sentry owner, manager, or admin permissions are required to install this integration.

</Alert>

### Sentry SaaS

<Alert>

This setup will only work if you are using Plane Cloud *and* Sentry SaaS. For self-hosted Plane/Sentry, see the [Sentry Self-Hosted](#sentry-self-hosted) section.

</Alert>

1. Navigate to **Settings > Integrations > Makeplane**

2. Follow the full [Plane setup instructions](https://docs.plane.so/integrations/sentry).

### Sentry Self-Hosted

As opposed to Sentry SaaS, *the Makeplane integration for Sentry Self-Hosted requires manual installation of the integration on Sentry*, on top of configuring the Plane integration.

In order to set up both integrations properly, you must complete the following:
1. Follow the full [Sentry installation instructions](https://developers.plane.so/self-hosting/govern/integrations/sentry) to set up both Sentry and Plane.
2. Once you have completed the installation, you must then follow the [Plane Setup Instructions](https://docs.plane.so/integrations/sentry) to get both the Sentry and Plane integrations to talk to each other.
