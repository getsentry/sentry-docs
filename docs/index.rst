    Sentry On-Premise Documentation
    ===============================

    Welcome to the documentation of the On-Premise Edition of Sentry — the
    modern error logging and aggregation platform.  This documentation
    covers the use of Sentry (The Sentry Open Source Server) as well as
    all officially supported client integrations (The Raven Clients).  To
    keep things easy we cover all different editions of the sentry server
    here.
