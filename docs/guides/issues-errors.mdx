You've set up Sentry error monitoring. Now what? This guide covers the high-value error patterns that help you catch problems before they impact users and fix issues faster.

## The Pattern

Sentry automatically captures unhandled errors. For handled errors, use `Sentry.captureException()` to add context:

```javascript
try {
  await processOrder(order);
} catch (error) {
  Sentry.captureException(error, {
    tags: {
      order_id: order.id,
      payment_method: order.paymentMethod
    },
    level: "error"
  });
  throw error;
}
```

**Levels:** `fatal`, `error`, `warning`, `info`, `debug`

**Context:** Tags, user info, and breadcrumbs help you debug faster. Tags are searchable, so use them for high-cardinality data like IDs, regions, and feature flags.

Every error in Sentry is automatically trace-connected. Click the trace ID to see the full [trace view](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/trace-view/) and understand what led to the error.

## Where to Look

Start with these five views to catch critical issues.

### 1. Unresolved High-Volume Issues

High event counts mean either many users are affected or one user is stuck in a loop. Both need immediate attention.

**In Issues:** Search for `is:unresolved` (applied by default) and use the sort dropdown (defaults to "Last Seen") to sort by **Events** 

**What to look for:**
- Issues at the top with high event counts (many occurrences in a short time)
- Click into these issues to see the stack trace and how many users are affected

Learn more about [Issue States & Triage](/product/issues/states-triage/) to manage and prioritize issues.

**Alert idea:** Trigger when event count spikes in a short time window to catch high-impact bugs and infinite loops.

### 2. New Issues After Deploy

Every deploy introduces risk. New errors that appear right after a release are usually regressions.

**In Issues:** Filter by `is:unresolved` and sort by **Age** to find issues that first appeared recently (not just issues that happened recently). Filter by release: `release:v1.2.3`

**What to look for:**
- Issues that didn't exist in the previous release
- Errors in code paths you just changed
- New error types (TypeError, ReferenceError) indicating breaking changes

Learn more about [Release Health](/product/releases/health/) to track error rates and crash-free sessions per release.

**Alert idea:** Trigger when a new issue is created, filtered to production environment and error/fatal level. This catches regressions immediately after deploy.

### 3. Errors by Environment

Production errors are critical. Staging errors help you catch problems before they reach users. Comparing environments helps you spot configuration issues.

**In Issues:** Search for `is:unresolved environment:production` or `environment:staging`

**What to look for:**
- Errors only in production (often config, API keys, or data issues)
- Errors only in staging (caught before deploy, needs fixing)
- Same error in both (systemic code issue)

Learn more about <PlatformLink to="/configuration/environments/">configuring environments</PlatformLink> to separate production and staging issues.

**Alert idea:** Trigger when a new issue is created, filtered to production environment. These often indicate config drift or environment-specific bugs.

### 4. Errors with High User Impact

Some errors affect power users heavily. Others affect everyone rarely. Prioritize by unique user count, not just event count.

**In Issues:** Search for `is:unresolved` and use the sort dropdown to sort by **Users**

**What to look for:**
- Issues affecting many unique users (e.g., more than 10 users indicates widespread impact)
- Issues affecting VIP or paying users (check user tags)
- Issues blocking core workflows (login, checkout, data access)

Learn more about <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/tags/">custom tags</PlatformLink> to mark user tiers, plans, or roles. Then search `is:unresolved user.tier:enterprise` to prioritize high-value users.

**Alert idea:** Trigger when unique user count exceeds a threshold in a time window (e.g., more than 50 users in 1 hour) to catch widespread issues.

### 5. User-Reported Issues

When users report problems, they often see an error. User feedback tells you which errors hurt the experience most, even if event counts are low.

**In Issues:** Navigate to **User Feedback** in the left sidebar to see reports submitted by users.

**What to look for:**
- User descriptions of what they were doing when the error occurred
- Patterns in feedback about specific workflows or features
- Issues that frustrate users even if they don't generate many events

Enable the [User Feedback Widget](/platforms/javascript/user-feedback/) to let users report problems directly when errors happen.

**Alert idea:** Trigger when a new issue is created, filtered to issue category equals feedback. This ensures you respond quickly when users report problems.

## Creating Issue Alerts

Issue alerts notify you when specific conditions are met. To create one:

1. Go to **Alerts** and click "Create Alert Rule"
2. Select "Issues" and click "Set Conditions"
3. Configure "When" conditions (what triggers the alert)
4. Add "If" filters to narrow the scope (optional)
5. Set "Then" actions (where to send notifications)

Common triggers: new issues, high event counts, high user counts, state changes.

Common filters: environment, tags, issue properties.

## Error Handling Strategy

### Capture Context, Not Just Exceptions

When you catch an error, add tags, user info, and breadcrumbs to make debugging instant.

```javascript
Sentry.captureException(error, {
  tags: {
    order_id: order.id,
    payment_gateway: "stripe",
    region: user.region
  },
  user: {
    id: user.id,
    email: user.email
  },
  contexts: {
    order: {
      total: order.total,
      items: order.items.length,
      discount_code: order.discountCode
    }
  }
});
```

**Search in Sentry:** `order_id:order_123` or `payment_gateway:stripe region:us-west`

### Ignore Known Noise

Some errors aren't actionable. Use `ignoreErrors` to filter them out.

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "...",
  ignoreErrors: [
    "Non-Error promise rejection captured",
    /^Timeout of \d+ms exceeded$/
  ]
});
```

Also use `beforeSend` to filter errors dynamically:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  beforeSend(event, hint) {
    // Ignore errors from browser extensions
    if (event.exception?.values?.[0]?.stacktrace?.frames?.some(
      frame => frame.filename?.includes("chrome-extension://")
    )) {
      return null;
    }
    return event;
  }
});
```

## Quick Reference

| View | Search Query | Look For |
|------|--------------|----------|
| High-volume issues | `is:unresolved` (sort by Events) | High event counts, post-deploy spikes |
| New regressions | `is:unresolved` (sort by Age) | Issues that first appeared recently |
| Environment issues | `environment:production` | Prod-only config or data issues |
| High user impact | `is:unresolved` (sort by Users) | Issues affecting many users |
