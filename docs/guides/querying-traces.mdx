You've enabled [Sentry Tracing](/product/explore/trace-explorer/). Now what? Sentry's auto-instrumentation captures a lot without custom code. This guide shows you how to query that data to find performance issues.

## What's Auto-Instrumented

With `browserTracingIntegration()` enabled, Sentry automatically captures:

- Page loads and navigation
- Fetch/XHR requests
- Long animation frames (main thread blocking)
- Resource loading (JS, CSS, images)

## Where to Look

Start with these five queries and you'll catch most performance issues before users complain.

### 1. Slow Page Loads: Pages taking too long to become interactive hurt first impressions

**Query in [Explore > Traces](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/explore/traces/):** `span.op:pageload` & **Visualize:** `p90(span.duration)` grouped by `transaction` to compare routes.

- **What to look for:** Routes with p90 over 3 seconds. Explore sample traces to see the breakdown. Usually it's slow API calls, heavy JavaScript, or large images.

- **Alert idea:** `p75(transaction.duration) > 3s` for pageload transactions.

### 2. Slow API Calls: Fetch/XHR requests are often the bottleneck in modern web apps

**Query in [Explore > Traces](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/explore/traces/):** `span.op:http.client` & **Visualize:** `avg(span.duration)` grouped by `span.description` (the URL).

- **What to look for:** Endpoints with avg duration over 1 second or p95 over 2 seconds. Check if it's the backend or network latency by looking at sample traces.

- **Alert idea:** `p95(span.duration) > 2s` where `span.op:http.client`.

### 3. JavaScript Blocking the UI: Long animation frames mean JavaScript execution is freezing the interface

**Query in [Explore > Traces](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/explore/traces/):** `span.op:ui.long-animation-frame` & **Visualize:** Sort by `span.duration` to find the worst offenders.

- **What to look for:** Frames over 200ms. This is what causes jank and unresponsiveness. Look at the stack trace in sample traces to find the expensive operation.

- **Alert idea:** `p75(span.duration) > 200ms` for long animation frames.

### 4. Slow SPA Navigation: After the initial load, how fast do users move between pages?

**Query in [Explore > Traces](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/explore/traces/):** `span.op:navigation` & **Visualize:** `p90(span.duration)` grouped by `transaction` to compare route performance.

- **What to look for:** Navigation over 1 second feels sluggish. Click into traces to see if it's data fetching, component rendering, or something else.

- **Alert idea:** `p75(span.duration) > 2s` for navigation.

### 5. Heavy Resources: Large JS bundles, stylesheets, or images slowing down your site

**Query in [Explore > Traces](https://sentry.io/orgredirect/organizations/:orgslug/explore/traces/):** `span.op:resource.script` (JavaScript), `span.op:resource.css` (stylesheets), or `span.op:resource.img` (images) & **Visualize:** `avg(span.duration)` to find the heaviest assets.

- **What to look for:** Resources taking over 1 second. Check the span description to see which files. Often it's third-party scripts or unoptimized images.

- **Alert idea:** `p75(span.duration) > 3s` for resource.script.

## Creating Alerts From Traces

1. Go to **Explore > Traces**
2. Build your query (e.g., `span.op:http.client`)
3. Click **Save As** - **Alert**
4. Choose a threshold type:
   - **Static:** Alert when a value exceeds a threshold
   - **Percent Change:** Alert when a value changes relative to a previous period
   - **Anomaly:** Let Sentry detect unusual patterns
5. Configure notification channels and save

**Tip:** Averages can hide outliers, use p75/p90/p95 instead.

| Category            | Query                             | Visualize                           |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Slow page loads     | `span.op:pageload`                | `p90(span.duration)` by transaction |
| Slow fetch requests | `span.op:http.client`             | `avg(span.duration)` by URL         |
| JS blocking UI      | `span.op:ui.long-animation-frame` | `max(span.duration)`                |
| Slow SPA navigation | `span.op:navigation`              | `p90(span.duration)` by transaction |
| Heavy resources     | `span.op:resource.*`              | `avg(span.duration)` by description |
