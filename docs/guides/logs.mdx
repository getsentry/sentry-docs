You've set up Sentry Logs. Now what? This guide covers the high-value logging patterns that help you debug faster and catch problems before users report them.

## The Pattern

Every structured log follows the same format:

```javascript
Sentry.logger.<level>(message, { attributes });
```

**Levels:** `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`

**Attributes:** Key-value pairs you can search and filter on. Consistency matters, so use whatever naming convention fits your codebase.

```javascript
Sentry.logger.info("Order completed", {
  orderId: "order_123",
  userId: user.id,
  amount: 149.99,
  paymentMethod: "stripe"
});
```

Logs in Sentry are automatically trace-connected. Each log shows a trace ID that links to the full [trace view](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/trace-view/).

## Where to Add Logs

Start with these five areas and you'll catch most issues before users do.

### 1. Authentication Events

Login flows are invisible until something breaks. Log successes and failures to spot patterns like brute force attempts, OAuth misconfigurations, or MFA issues.

```javascript
Sentry.logger.info("User logged in", {
  userId: user.id,
  authMethod: "oauth",
  provider: "google"
});

Sentry.logger.warn("Login failed", {
  email: maskedEmail,
  reason: "invalid_password",
  attemptCount: 3
});
```

**Search in Sentry:** `userId:123 "logged in"` or `severity:warn authMethod:*`

**Alert idea:** Alert when `severity:warn "Login failed"` spikes in a 5-minute window—this can indicate brute force attempts or auth provider issues.

### 2. Payment and Checkout

Money paths need visibility even when they succeed. When payments fail, you need context fast.

```javascript
Sentry.logger.error("Payment failed", {
  orderId: "order_123",
  amount: 99.99,
  gateway: "stripe",
  errorCode: "card_declined",
  cartItems: 3
});
```

**Search in Sentry:** `orderId:order_123` or `severity:error gateway:stripe`

**Alert idea:** Alert when `severity:error gateway:*` spikes—this can indicate payment provider outages.

### 3. External APIs and Async Operations

Traces capture what your code does. Logs capture context about external triggers and async boundaries. Things like webhooks, scheduled tasks, and third-party API responses that traces can't automatically instrument.

```javascript
// Third-party API call
const start = Date.now();
const response = await shippingApi.getRates(items);

Sentry.logger.info("Shipping rates fetched", {
  service: "shipping-provider",
  endpoint: "/rates",
  durationMs: Date.now() - start,
  rateCount: response.rates.length
});

// Webhook received
Sentry.logger.info("Webhook received", {
  source: "stripe",
  eventType: "payment_intent.succeeded",
  paymentId: event.data.object.id
});
```

**Search in Sentry:** `service:shipping-provider durationMs:>2000` or `source:stripe`

**Alert idea:** Alert when `service:* durationMs:>3000` to catch third-party slowdowns before they cascade.

### 4. Background Jobs

Jobs run outside the request context. Without logs, failed jobs are invisible until someone notices missing data.

```javascript
Sentry.logger.info("Job started", {
  jobType: "email-digest",
  jobId: "job_456",
  queue: "notifications"
});

Sentry.logger.error("Job failed", {
  jobType: "email-digest",
  jobId: "job_456",
  retryCount: 3,
  lastError: "SMTP timeout"
});
```

**Search in Sentry:** `jobType:email-digest severity:error`

**Alert idea:** Alert when `severity:error jobType:*` spikes—this can indicate queue processing issues or downstream failures.

### 5. Feature Flags and Config Changes

When something breaks after a deploy, the first question is "what changed?" Logging flag evaluations and config reloads gives you that answer instantly.

```javascript
Sentry.logger.info("Feature flag evaluated", {
  flag: "new-checkout-flow",
  enabled: true,
  userId: user.id
});

Sentry.logger.warn("Config reloaded", {
  reason: "env-change",
  changedKeys: ["API_TIMEOUT", "MAX_CONNECTIONS"]
});
```

**Search in Sentry:** `flag:new-checkout-flow` or `"Config reloaded"`

## Creating Alerts From Logs

{/* TODO: replace with Arcade */}

1. Go to **Explore > Logs**
2. Enter your search query (e.g., `severity:error gateway:*`)
3. Click **Save As** - **Alert**
4. Choose a threshold type:
   - **Static:** Alert when count exceeds a value
   - **Percent Change:** Alert when count changes relative to a previous period
   - **Anomaly:** Let Sentry detect unusual patterns
5. Configure notification channels and save

## Logging Strategy

### Development Logging

In development, set sample rates to 100% to catch everything. This helps you understand what logs are being generated and tune your instrumentation before it hits production.

**Development configuration:**

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "...",
  environment: "development",
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,  // 100% of traces
  // Capture all logs in development
  integrations: [
    Sentry.captureConsoleIntegration({
      levels: ["log", "info", "warn", "error", "debug"]
    })
  ]
});
```

Use verbose logging levels like `debug` (development diagnostics) and `trace` (fine-grained execution details) freely in development. You can [filter these out in production](/platforms/javascript/logs/#filter-logs) using `beforeSendLog` to only capture `info` and above.

### Production Logging

Local debugging often means many small logs tracing execution flow. In production, this creates noise that's hard to query.

Instead, log fewer messages with higher cardinality. Store events during execution and emit them as a single structured log.

**Don't do this:**

```javascript
Sentry.logger.info("Checkout started", { userId: "882" });
Sentry.logger.info("Discount applied", { code: "WINTER20" });
Sentry.logger.error("Payment failed", { reason: "Insufficient Funds" });
```

These logs are trace-connected, but searching for the error won't return the userId or discount code from the same transaction.

**Do this instead:**

```javascript
Sentry.logger.error("Checkout failed", {
  userId: "882",
  orderId: "order_pc_991",
  cartTotal: 142.50,
  discountCode: "WINTER20",
  paymentMethod: "stripe",
  errorReason: "Insufficient Funds",
  itemCount: 4
});
```

One log tells the whole story. Search for the error and get full context.

### Log Drains for Platform Logs

If you can't install the Sentry SDK or need platform-level logs (CDN, database, load balancer), use [Log Drains](/product/drains/).

**Platform drains:** [Vercel](/product/drains/vercel/), [Cloudflare Workers](/product/drains/cloudflare/), [Heroku](/product/drains/heroku/), [Supabase](/product/drains/supabase/)

**Forwarders:** [OpenTelemetry Collector](/concepts/otlp/forwarding/pipelines/collector/), [Vector](/concepts/otlp/forwarding/pipelines/vector/), [Fluent Bit](/concepts/otlp/forwarding/pipelines/fluentbit/), [AWS CloudWatch](/concepts/otlp/forwarding/sources/aws-cloudwatch/), [Kafka](/concepts/otlp/forwarding/sources/kafka/)
