The Naming of Sentry and Raven
------------------------------

The origin of the names comes from our naming scheme at Disqus. If you dig
around many of the open source repos (and some of the Sentry dependencies)
you'll see a common thread: StarCraft 2. Originally we started with the
name Sentry representing a Protoss unit that had a shield, which was
fairly fitting as Sentry helps shield you from problems, but doesn't
prevent them, just like the unit. When we named the first SDK we went with
Raven, which represents a Terran air unit that also happens to place
Sentry turrets.

tl;dr Sentry and Raven are StarCraft 2 units.
