# The _platforms folder

The JSON files contained in this folder used to be generated by Gatsby from the
content of the `src/wizard` directory. The live generation isn't handled from
the Next.js version, pending an investigation into whether we really need this
anymore.

The content was generated from sentry-docs commit
`549963696a8c1ec3bcf024d56bdd51439ca3ae2a`.

For an example of where it is (maybe) used, see:
