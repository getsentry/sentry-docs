# Sentry Documentation

The Sentry documentation is a static site, generated by [Jekyll][jekyll].

## Getting started

You will need [Ruby][ruby], [Bundler][bundler], [Node.js][nodejs], and [Yarn] installed.

```
$ bin/server
```

This will run Bundler to install all the necessary dependencies and then run a webserver at http://localhost:4000/.

[ruby]: https://www.ruby-lang.org/
[bundler]: http://bundler.io/
[nodejs]: https://nodejs.org/
[yarn]: https://yarnpkg.com

## Layout components

While in dev mode, visit [localhost:4000/dev/components/](http://localhost:4000/dev/components/) to see the components available.

## Adding content

The Sentry documentation contains two document types: categories and documents. Documents may have child documents.

### Add a category

Categories are manually defined.

1. Add a new entry to _src/data/categories.yml_. Order is defined by the order in this document.

  ```
    # Display name for the category
  - title: Category Name

    # slug matching a filename in _includes/svg/
    icon: category-icon

    # A slug for the category. Must match a file or folder in collections/_documentation/
    slug: category-slug
  ```

1. Create a markdown file or a folder of markdown files in collections/_documentation/

### Add a document

Category hierarchy is automatically defined by folder structure. Add a markdown file to a folder within _src/collections/_documentation_. Order is alphabetical by default, or you may force sorting order by adding an  `sidebar_order` integer value in the frontmatter of the document.
