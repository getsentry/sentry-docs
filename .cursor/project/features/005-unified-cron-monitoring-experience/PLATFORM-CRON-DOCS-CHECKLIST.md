[Platform-agnostic description with link to UI setup guide]

### Automatic Integration  
[Platform-specific auto-instrumentation if available]

### Manual Methods
[Link to the four manual approaches]

[Platform-specific getting started example]
```

#### 2. Automatic Integration (`automatic.mdx`)
**Platform Capability Assessment:**
- [ ] **Full Auto-instrumentation:** Platform has popular cron libraries that can be auto-instrumented
- [ ] **Limited Support:** Some libraries supported, link to manual methods for others  
- [ ] **No Support:** Platform doesn't have auto-instrumentation, redirect to manual methods

**Required Updates:**
- [ ] Platform-specific library detection and instrumentation
- [ ] Clear "when to use" guidance
- [ ] Working code examples for supported libraries
- [ ] Links to manual methods for unsupported cases

#### 3. Manual Method Pages
**Apply to All Four Methods:**
- [ ] `job-monitoring.mdx`
- [ ] `check-ins.mdx`  
- [ ] `heartbeat.mdx`
- [ ] `upserting-monitors.mdx`

**Content Reduction Requirements:**
- [ ] **Target Length:** 50-80 lines (down from 200+ lines)
- [ ] **Structure:** Purpose ‚Üí When to Use ‚Üí Quick Example ‚Üí Reference Links
- [ ] **Remove:** Verbose explanations, repeated setup instructions
- [ ] **Keep:** Essential usage patterns, working code examples

**Platform-Specific Code Examples:**
- [ ] Verify all code examples work with current SDK version
- [ ] Use platform-appropriate syntax and conventions
- [ ] Include necessary imports and setup
- [ ] Remove placeholders where possible (use real values)

#### 4. Troubleshooting (`troubleshooting.mdx`)
**Convert from Narrative to FAQ:**
- [ ] **Current Assessment:** Identify verbose troubleshooting content
- [ ] **Target Structure:** 4-6 key FAQ items maximum
- [ ] **Platform-Specific Issues:** Include platform-specific troubleshooting
- [ ] **Support Navigation:** Include "Getting Help" section with links

**FAQ Structure Template:**
```markdown
# Troubleshooting

## Getting Help
[Links to support, platform-specific documentation, etc.]
```

#### 5. Content Cleanup
**Remove Advanced Configuration Pages:**
- [ ] Assess if platform has "advanced" configuration pages
- [ ] **Decision:** Remove entirely (following JavaScript precedent) 
- [ ] **Reason:** Users feedback indicated these were "overkill"
- [ ] Update all links that referenced advanced pages

**Link Management:**
- [ ] Verify all internal links work after page removal
- [ ] Update sidebar navigation order
- [ ] Fix any broken cross-references
- [ ] Test dev server for 404 errors
