### Required Page Changes Per Platform

#### 1. Main Index Page (`index.mdx`)
**Current State Assessment:**
- [ ] Evaluate current content length and complexity
- [ ] Identify repetitive explanations
- [ ] Check for overwhelming decision points

**Required Updates:**
- [ ] Simplify integration path presentation
- [ ] Remove verbose explanations
- [ ] Clear categorization: UI Setup → Automatic → Manual Methods
- [ ] Remove repetitive notes about CLI/HTTP limitations
- [ ] Ensure working platform-specific examples

**Content Structure:**
```markdown
# Cron Monitoring

Brief intro to cron monitoring for {platform}.

## Integration Methods

### UI Setup
[Platform-agnostic description with link to UI setup guide]

### Automatic Integration  
[Platform-specific auto-instrumentation if available]

### Manual Methods
[Link to the four manual approaches]

[Platform-specific getting started example]
```

#### 2. Automatic Integration (`automatic.mdx`)
**Platform Capability Assessment:**
- [ ] **Full Auto-instrumentation:** Platform has popular cron libraries that can be auto-instrumented
- [ ] **Limited Support:** Some libraries supported, link to manual methods for others  
- [ ] **No Support:** Platform doesn't have auto-instrumentation, redirect to manual methods

**Required Updates:**
- [ ] Platform-specific library detection and instrumentation
- [ ] Clear "when to use" guidance
- [ ] Working code examples for supported libraries
- [ ] Links to manual methods for unsupported cases

#### 3. Manual Method Pages
**Apply to All Four Methods:**
- [ ] `job-monitoring.mdx`
- [ ] `check-ins.mdx`  
- [ ] `heartbeat.mdx`
- [ ] `upserting-monitors.mdx`

**Content Reduction Requirements:**
- [ ] **Target Length:** 50-80 lines (down from 200+ lines)
- [ ] **Structure:** Purpose → When to Use → Quick Example → Reference Links
- [ ] **Remove:** Verbose explanations, repeated setup instructions
- [ ] **Keep:** Essential usage patterns, working code examples

**Platform-Specific Code Examples:**
- [ ] Verify all code examples work with current SDK version
- [ ] Use platform-appropriate syntax and conventions
- [ ] Include necessary imports and setup
- [ ] Remove placeholders where possible (use real values)

#### 4. Troubleshooting (`troubleshooting.mdx`)
**Convert from Narrative to FAQ:**
- [ ] **Current Assessment:** Identify verbose troubleshooting content
- [ ] **Target Structure:** 4-6 key FAQ items maximum
- [ ] **Platform-Specific Issues:** Include platform-specific troubleshooting
- [ ] **Support Navigation:** Include "Getting Help" section with links

**FAQ Structure Template:**
```markdown
# Troubleshooting

## Getting Help
[Links to support, platform-specific documentation, etc.]
```

#### 5. Content Cleanup
**Remove Advanced Configuration Pages:**
- [ ] Assess if platform has "advanced" configuration pages
- [ ] **Decision:** Remove entirely (following JavaScript precedent) 
- [ ] **Reason:** Users feedback indicated these were "overkill"
- [ ] Update all links that referenced advanced pages

**Link Management:**
- [ ] Verify all internal links work after page removal
- [ ] Update sidebar navigation order
- [ ] Fix any broken cross-references
- [ ] Test dev server for 404 errors

## 🔧 Platform-Specific Considerations

### High Auto-Instrumentation Platforms
**Platforms:** Node.js, Python
- [ ] Emphasize automatic integration as preferred method
- [ ] Provide clear library support matrix
- [ ] Include migration guidance from manual to automatic

### Limited Auto-Instrumentation Platforms  
**Platforms:** PHP, Java, others
- [ ] Focus on manual methods as primary approach
- [ ] Include auto-instrumentation for supported libraries where available
- [ ] Clear guidance on when manual methods are needed

### CLI/HTTP Only Platforms
**Platforms:** Generic HTTP, CLI usage
- [ ] Acknowledge SDK feature limitations upfront
- [ ] Focus on the available functionality
- [ ] Clear setup instructions specific to CLI/HTTP approach

### ⭐ Next.js Special Requirements - Vercel Integration

**Platforms:** Next.js specifically
- [ ] **Create dedicated Vercel integration page** - `automatic-vercel.mdx`
- [ ] **Link only from Next.js crons main page** - Not shown for other JavaScript frameworks
- [ ] **Content source combination:**
  - [Automatic Check-Ins (Vercel Only)](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/crons/#automatic-check-ins-vercel-only)
  - [Instrument Vercel Cron Jobs](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/manual-setup/#step-6-instrument-vercel-cron-jobs-optional)

**Required Content Structure:**
```markdown
# Automatic Vercel Integration

Automatic cron monitoring for Next.js applications deployed on Vercel.

## Prerequisites
- Next.js application hosted on Vercel
- Vercel Cron Jobs configured in vercel.json
- Pages Router (App Router not yet supported)

## Configuration

Add to your next.config.js:

```javascript
module.exports = withSentryConfig(nextConfig, {
  automaticVercelMonitors: true,
});
```

## How It Works
- Instrumented cron jobs decided at runtime by examining crons field in vercel.json
- Automatically creates Check-Ins in Sentry
- Currently supports Pages Router only

## Limitations
- Vercel hosting required
- Pages Router only (App Router route handlers not yet supported)
- Requires vercel.json cron configuration
```

**Implementation Checklist:**
- [ ] Create `docs/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/crons/automatic-vercel.mdx`
- [ ] Add link from main Next.js crons page only
- [ ] Include clear prerequisites and limitations
- [ ] Working code example with next.config.js
- [ ] Link to Vercel cron jobs documentation
- [ ] Note about Pages Router vs App Router support
