# Simplified Cron Documentation Experience - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## üìã Overview

**Feature Name:** Simplified Cron Documentation Experience
**Product Area:** Sentry Documentation (JavaScript Platform)
**Priority:** High
**Est. Development Time:** 2 weeks
**Target Release:** Next documentation deployment

### Executive Summary

Simplify the cron monitoring documentation by removing overwhelming styled components, clarifying that instrumentation is always required, and positioning different approaches honestly rather than misleadingly calling UI setup "easiest."

## üéØ Objectives

### Problem Statement

The current cron monitoring documentation creates confusion by:
- Positioning "UI Setup" as "easiest" when it's actually the most complete approach
- Using heavy styled card components that overwhelm users
- Not clearly explaining that ALL approaches require instrumentation
- Mixing CLI/HTTP alternatives with SDK approaches without explaining feature differences

### Solution Overview

Create clean, scannable documentation that:
- Uses simple bullet-point structure like sourcemaps.md
- Positions UI Setup as "recommended" (most complete) not "easiest"
- Clearly separates CLI/HTTP as alternatives without SDK benefits
- Makes space for interactive GIF to show UI creation flow

### Success Criteria

- Users can quickly scan and find their appropriate setup method
- Clear understanding that instrumentation is always required
- Reduced confusion about "easiest" vs "most complete" approaches
- Proper positioning of SDK vs non-SDK alternatives

## üë• Target Users

### Primary Users

- **JavaScript Developers:** Setting up cron monitoring for the first time
- **Node.js Teams:** Looking for the right instrumentation approach for their setup
- **DevOps Engineers:** Implementing monitoring across multiple cron jobs

### Secondary Users

- **Support Team:** Fewer tickets about "which approach should I use?"
- **Product Team:** Clear feedback on which flows are working

## üìù User Stories

### Core User Stories

1. **As a JavaScript developer**, I want to quickly understand which cron monitoring approach fits my setup so that I don't waste time reading irrelevant options
2. **As a Node.js team**, I want to understand the tradeoffs between UI setup and direct SDK integration so that I can choose the right approach for our workflow
3. **As a DevOps engineer**, I want to understand why SDK approaches are recommended over CLI/HTTP so that I can make informed architecture decisions

### Documentation Experience Stories

1. **As a user scanning documentation**, I want simple bullet points instead of heavy cards so that I can quickly find my path
2. **As a confused user**, I want honest positioning about what "recommended" means so that I set proper expectations
3. **As a visual learner**, I want to see a GIF of the UI creation flow so that I understand the process before starting

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements

### Documentation Structure

#### Main Index Page (`docs/platforms/javascript/common/crons/index.mdx`)

**Current State (112 lines):**
- Heavy styled card components with CSS classes
- "UI Setup (Easiest)" misleading positioning
- Complex decision-making content mixed with navigation

**New State (58 lines):**
- Simple bullet-point navigation
- "UI Setup (Recommended)" honest positioning  
- Clean structure like sourcemaps.md
- Placeholder for interactive arcade GIF

#### Content Organization

```markdown
## Setup Methods
* [UI Setup](ui-setup) - Create monitors in Sentry's web interface, then add instrumentation
* [Automatic Integration](automatic) - Auto-instrument existing cron libraries  
* [Manual Integration](manual) - Full SDK integration with custom handling
* [Advanced Setup](advanced) - Programmatically create and manage monitors

## Alternative Methods (Not Recommended)
* [Sentry CLI](https://docs.sentry.io/cli/crons/) - Command-line tool for basic monitoring
* [HTTP API](https://docs.sentry.io/product/crons/getting-started/http/) - Direct API calls for check-ins

**Note**: CLI and HTTP methods lack features available in language-specific SDKs such as automatic error capture, performance tracing, and contextual debugging information.
```

### Content Positioning

#### UI Setup Clarification
- **Old:** "UI Setup (Easiest)"
- **New:** "UI Setup (Recommended)"
- **Explanation:** Position as most complete approach that provides full monitoring + alerts configuration

#### Instrumentation Honesty
- Make clear that ALL approaches require code integration
- UI setup provides configuration but still needs instrumentation code
- Monitor slug must match between UI creation and code implementation

#### Alternative Methods Section
- Separate CLI and HTTP as "Alternative Methods (Not Recommended)"
- Clear explanation of missing SDK features (tracing, error context)
- Direct links to official CLI and HTTP documentation

### Visual Elements

#### Interactive GIF Placeholder
```markdown
{/* Placeholder for interactive arcade GIF showing UI creation flow */}
```
- Ready for future arcade-style interactive demonstration
- Shows UI monitor creation process
- Helps users understand before they start

#### Clean Navigation
- Remove all styled card components (`<div className="flex flex-wrap gap-4 mb-8">`)
- Use standard markdown bullet points
- Focus on scannable content structure

## üìä Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. **`docs/platforms/javascript/common/crons/index.mdx`**
   - Remove heavy card components (54 lines ‚Üí 0 lines)
   - Change positioning from "easiest" to "recommended"
   - Add CLI/HTTP alternatives section
   - Add GIF placeholder

2. **Feature Documentation Updates**
   - Update PRFAQ with evolved problem understanding
   - Update PRD with specific implementation requirements
   - Document critical open questions for product strategy

### Content Metrics

- **Line Reduction:** 112 lines ‚Üí 58 lines (48% reduction)
- **Component Removal:** All styled card components eliminated
- **Structure:** From decision-heavy to navigation-focused
- **Clarity:** Clear separation of SDK vs non-SDK approaches

## üîç Success Metrics

### User Experience Metrics
- Time to find appropriate setup method (target: <30 seconds)
- Reduced confusion tickets about "which approach to use"
- Positive feedback on documentation clarity

### Content Performance Metrics
- Page engagement (less time spent = users finding answers faster)
- Bounce rate from crons index to specific method pages
- Documentation feedback scores

### Product Strategy Metrics
- Understanding of UI-first vs code-first user preferences
- Adoption rates of different instrumentation approaches
- Feedback on CLI/HTTP vs SDK positioning

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Considerations

### Technical Risks
- **GIF Loading:** Interactive arcade GIF could impact page load times
- **Link Maintenance:** External links to CLI/HTTP docs need monitoring

### Product Risks
- **Positioning Changes:** Moving from "easiest" to "recommended" might affect user choices
- **Alternative Methods:** Clearly marking CLI/HTTP as "not recommended" might discourage some users

### Mitigation Strategies
- Monitor user feedback on new positioning
- Track adoption metrics for different approaches
- Be ready to adjust messaging based on real user behavior

## ‚ùì Open Questions

**PRIORITY 1: What is the bare minimum to get working cron monitoring?**

**Option A: Code-First Approach**
- Developer adds `Sentry.captureCheckIn()` calls to existing cron job
- Gets cron execution signals in Sentry immediately
- ‚ùì **But does this create alerts by default? Or just raw data?**
- ‚ùì **Do they need to finish setup in the UI afterwards for alerting?**

**Option B: UI-First Approach** 
- Developer creates monitor definition in Sentry UI (includes alert configuration)
- Then adds minimal instrumentation code to their job
- Gets both execution data AND configured alerts immediately

**Key Questions:**
1. **What's the ideal customer flow we want to encourage?** UI-first or code-first?
2. **What does "easiest" actually mean?** Least code changes vs most value vs fastest time-to-alerts?
3. **Should we position UI setup as "most complete" rather than "easiest"?**
4. **Does bare-minimum code instrumentation provide enough value without UI configuration?**

**PRIORITY 2: How do we define "easiest" vs "most valuable"?**

Current documentation positions UI setup as "easiest" but this may be misleading:
- **UI Setup**: More setup steps, but provides complete monitoring + alerting
- **Code-only**: Fewer steps, but may provide incomplete monitoring experience

We need to clarify whether we're optimizing for:
- **Minimal code changes** (technical ease)
- **Fastest time to value** (getting alerts working)
- **Most complete monitoring** (full feature set)
