# PR Description & Quality Standards

## Self-Review Checklist

Before creating a PR, review your own diff:

- [ ] Changes match the stated intent -- no unrelated modifications
- [ ] No debug code, console.logs, or TODO comments left behind
- [ ] No secrets, tokens, or credentials in the diff
- [ ] All new/changed code follows existing patterns in the codebase

## Description Quality Rules

- Description MUST explain **what** changed and **why**
- Never leave the description blank or restate the PR title
- Use bullet points for multiple discrete changes
- Link related issues with "Resolves #NNN" or "Fixes #NNN"
- Keep the "DESCRIBE YOUR PR" section concise but informative

## PR Title Format

PR titles follow commit convention: `type(scope): subject`

- Types: feat, fix, docs, ref, chore, test, style, perf, build, ci, meta
- Example: `docs(javascript): add Hono framework guide`

## PR Template

When creating pull requests for sentry-docs, use the following format:

```markdown
## DESCRIBE YOUR PR

[Clear description of what the PR does and why]

[Bullet points of specific changes if helpful]

- Change 1
- Change 2

## IS YOUR CHANGE URGENT?

Help us prioritize incoming PRs by letting us know when the change needs to go live.
- [ ] Urgent deadline (GA date, etc.): <!-- ENTER DATE HERE -->
- [ ] Other deadline: <!-- ENTER DATE HERE -->
- [x] None: Not urgent, can wait up to 1 week+

## SLA

- Teamwork makes the dream work, so please add a reviewer to your PRs.
- Please give the docs team up to 1 week to review your PR unless you've added an urgent due date to it.
Thanks in advance for your help!

## PRE-MERGE CHECKLIST

*Make sure you've checked the following before merging your changes:*

- [ ] Checked Vercel preview for correctness, including links
- [ ] PR was reviewed and approved by any necessary SMEs (subject matter experts)
- [ ] PR was reviewed and approved by a member of the [Sentry docs team](https://github.com/orgs/getsentry/teams/docs)
```
