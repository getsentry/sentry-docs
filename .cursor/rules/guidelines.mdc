### 📋 Development Patterns
Follow established documentation patterns:
- **MDX patterns** for rich content with React components
- **Next.js patterns** for modern static site generation
- **Component patterns** for reusable docs elements
- **Content patterns** for consistent information structure
- **Platform patterns** for SDK-specific documentation

### 📂 Repository Organization
Maintain clear structure:
- **Content organization** in `docs/` and `develop-docs/`
- **Shared components** in `src/components/`
- **Platform includes** in `platform-includes/`
- **Shared content** in `includes/`
- **Configuration** for build and deployment

## 🟢 First Questions Protocol

When engaging with documentation tasks, ask:

### Content Context
- Is this user-facing or developer-facing documentation?
- Which platforms or SDKs does this content apply to?
- What skill level is the target audience?
- Are there existing patterns or templates to follow?

### Technical Approach
- Should this be a React component or MDX content?
- Are there shared includes that can be reused?
- What frontmatter metadata is needed?
- How does this fit into the navigation structure?

### User Experience
- How will users discover this content?
- What are the common user journeys and flows?
- Are there related topics that need cross-references?
- What examples or code samples are needed?

### Maintenance
- How will this content stay up to date?
- Are there version-specific considerations?
- What testing or validation is needed?
- How does this impact site performance?

## 📚 Documentation Site Context

### Repository Structure
```
sentry-docs/
├── docs/                 # User documentation
│   ├── platforms/       # SDK platform guides
│   ├── product/         # Product features
│   ├── api/            # API reference
│   └── concepts/       # Core concepts
├── develop-docs/       # Developer documentation

├── platform-includes/ # Platform-specific content
├── includes/          # Shared content
└── app/               # Next.js pages
```

### Key Systems
- **Content Management** - MDX files with frontmatter metadata
- **Platform Support** - Multi-SDK documentation with shared patterns
- **Navigation** - Hierarchical docs structure with cross-references
- **Search** - Full-text search across all documentation
- **Performance** - Static generation with optimal loading

### Development Priorities
1. **Clarity** - Documentation must be clear and actionable
2. **Consistency** - Patterns should be consistent across platforms
3. **Performance** - Fast loading for good user experience
4. **Accessibility** - Inclusive design for all users
5. **Maintainability** - Easy to update and extend content

### Critical Constraints
- **Multi-platform support** - Content works across many SDKs
- **Version compatibility** - Handle multiple SDK versions
- **Performance** - Static generation for optimal speed
- **SEO** - Good search engine optimization
- **Accessibility** - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

## 🔧 Common Development Patterns

### MDX Content
```mdx
---
title: "Getting Started with React"
description: "Install and configure Sentry in your React app"
platform: "javascript.react"
sidebar_order: 1
---

import {PlatformContent} from 'sentry-docs/components/platformContent';
import {Alert} from 'sentry-docs/components/alert';

<PlatformContent includePath="getting-started-install" />

<Alert level="info">
  React 16.8+ is required for hook support.
</Alert>
```

### React Components
```typescript
// Component for platform-specific content
const PlatformContent = ({includePath}: {includePath: string}) => {
  const platform = useCurrentPlatform();
  return <ContentRenderer path={`${includePath}/${platform}`} />;
};
```

### Navigation Structure
```typescript
// Hierarchical navigation with platform support
const navigation = {
  'getting-started': {
    title: 'Getting Started',
    children: {
      'installation': 'Installation',
      'configuration': 'Configuration',
    }
  }
};
```
